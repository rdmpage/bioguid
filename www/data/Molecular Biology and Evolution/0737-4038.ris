N2  - In this study we address the problem of interpreting a bootstrap tree. The main issue is choosing the threshold of clade selection in order to separate reliable clades from unreliable ones, depending on their bootstrap proportion. This threshold depends on the chosen error measure. We investigate error measures that stem from a generalization of Robinson and Foulds' (1981) distance, used to quantify the divergence between the true phylogeny and the estimated trees. We propose two analytical approximations of the optimum threshold of clade selection to interpret (i.e., reduce) the bootstrap tree. We performed extensive simulations along the lines of Kuhner and Felsenstein (1994) using the neighbor-joining and the maximum-parsimony methods. These simulations show that our approximations cause only small losses in quality when compared to the optimum threshold resulting from empirical observation. Next, we measured the error reduction achieved when estimating the true phylogeny by the properly reduced bootstrap tree rather than by the complete original tree, obtained with a classical tree-building method. Our simulations on short sequences show than an error reduction of 39% is achieved with the parsimony method and an error reduction of 33% is achieved with the distance method when the error is measured with the standard Robinson and Foulds distance. The observed error reduction is shown to originate from an important decrease in Type I error (wrong inferences), while Type II error (omitted correct clades) is only slightly increased. Greater error reduction is achieved when shorter sequences are used, and when more importance is given to Type I error than to Type II error. To investigate the causes of error from another point of view, we propose a general decomposition of the error expectation in two terms of bias, and one of variance. Results for these terms show that no fundamental bias is introduced by the bootstrap process, the only source of bias being structural (lack of resolution). Moreover, the variance in the estimations is greatly reduced, providing another explanation for the better results of the reduced bootstrap tree compared with the original tree estimate.

N2  - We present fast new algorithms for evaluating trees with respect to least squares and minimum evolution (ME), the most commonly used criteria for inferring phylogenetic trees from distance data. The new algorithms include an optimal O(N2) time algorithm for calculating the edge (branch or internode) lengths on a tree according to ordinary or unweighted least squares (OLS); an O(N3) time algorithm for edge lengths under weighted least squares (WLS) including the Fitch-Margoliash method; and an optimal O(N4) time algorithm for generalized least-squares (GLS) edge lengths (where N is the number of taxa in the tree). The ME criterion is based on the sum of edge lengths. Consequently, the edge lengths algorithms presented here lead directly to O(N2), O(N3), and O(N4) time algorithms for ME under OLS, WLS, and GLS, respectively. All of these algorithms are as fast as or faster than any of those previously published, and the algorithms for OLS and GLS are the fastest possible (with respect to order of computational complexity). A major advantage of our new methods is that they are as well adapted to multifurcating trees as they are to binary trees. An optimal algorithm for determining path lengths from a tree with given edge lengths is also developed. This leads to an optimal O(N2) algorithm for OLS sums of squares evaluation and corresponding O(N3) and O(N4) time algorithms for WLS and GLS sums of squares, respectively. The GLS algorithm is time-optimal if the covariance matrix is already inverted. The speed of each algorithm is assessed analytically--the speed increases we calculate are confirmed by the dramatic speed increases resulting from their implementation in PAUP* 4.0. The new algorithms enable far more extensive tree searches and statistical evaluations (e.g., bootstrap, parametric bootstrap, or jackknife) in the same amount of time. Hopefully, the fast algorithms for WLS and GLS will encourage the use of these criteria for evaluating trees and their edge lengths (e.g., for approximate divergence time estimates), since they should be more statistically efficient than OLS.

N2  - We review the anatomical and archaeological evidence for an early population bottleneck in humans and bracket the time when it could have occurred. We outline the subsequent demographic changes that the archaeological evidence of range expansions and contractions address, and we examine how inbreeding effective population size provides an alternative view of past population size change. This addresses the question of other, more recent, population size bottlenecks, and we review nonrecombining and recombining genetic systems that may reflect them. We examine how these genetic data constrain the possibility of significant population size bottlenecks (i.e., of sufficiently small size and/or long duration to minimize genetic variation in autosomal and haploid systems) at several different critical times in human history. Different constraints appear in nonrecombining and recombining systems, and among the autosomal loci most are incompatible with any Pleistocene population size expansions. Microsatellite data seem to show Pleistocene population size expansions, but in aggregate they are difficult to interpret because different microsatellite studies do not show the same expansion. The archaeological data are only compatible with a few of these analyses, most prominently with data from Alu elements, and we use these facts to question whether the view of the past from analysis of inbreeding effective population size is valid. Finally, we examine the issue of whether inbreeding effective population size provides any reasonable measure of the actual past size of the human species. We contend that if the evidence of a population size bottleneck early in the evolution of our lineage is accepted, most genetic data either lack the resolution to address subsequent changes in the human population or do not meet the assumptions required to do so validly. It is our conclusion that, at the moment, genetic data cannot disprove a simple model of exponential population growth following a bottleneck 2 MYA at the origin of our lineage and extending through the Pleistocene. Archaeological and paleontological data indicate that this model is too oversimplified to be an accurate reflection of detailed population history, and therefore we find that genetic data lack the resolution to validly reflect many details of Pleistocene human population change. However, there is one detail that these data are sufficient to address. Both genetic and anthropological data are incompatible with the hypothesis of a recent population size bottleneck. Such an event would be expected to leave a significant mark across numerous genetic loci and observable anatomical traits, but while some subsets of data are compatible with a recent population size bottleneck, there is no consistently expressed effect that can be found across the range where it should appear, and this absence disproves the hypothesis.

T1  - Evidence from Beta-Tubulin Phylogeny that Microsporidia Evolved from Within the Fungi

N2  - Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that were thought to be an ancient eukaryotic lineage based on molecular phylogenies using ribosomal RNA and translation elongation factors. However, this ancient origin of microsporidia has been contested recently, as several other molecular phylogenies suggest that microsporidia are closely related to fungi. Most of the protein trees that place microsporidia with fungi are not well sampled, however, and it is impossible to resolve whether microsporidia evolved from a fungus or from a protistan relative of fungi. We have sequenced beta-tubulins from 3 microsporidia, 4 chytrid fungi, and 12 zygomycete fungi, expanding the representation of beta-tubulin to include all four fungal divisions and a wide diversity of microsporidia. In phylogenetic trees including these new sequences, the overall topology of the fungal beta-tubulins generally matched the expected relationships among the four fungal divisions, although the zygomycetes were polyphyletic in some analyses. The microsporidia consistently fell within this fungal diversification, and not as a sister group to fungi. Overall, beta-tubulin phylogeny suggests that microsporidia evolved from a fungus sometime after the divergence of chytrids. We also found that chytrid alpha- and beta-tubulins are much less divergent than are tubulins from other fungi or microsporidia. In trees in which the only fungal representatives were the chytrids, microsporidia still branched with fungi (i.e., with chytrids), suggesting that the affiliation between microsporidian and fungal tubulins is not an artifact of long-branch attraction.

N2  - Approximate methods for estimating the numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions between two DNA sequences involve three steps: counting of synonymous and nonsynonymous sites in the two sequences, counting of synonymous and nonsynonymous differences between the two sequences, and correcting for multiple substitutions at the same site. We examine complexities involved in those steps and propose a new approximate method that takes into account two major features of DNA sequence evolution: transition/transversion rate bias and base/codon frequency bias. We compare the new method with maximum likelihood, as well as several other approximate methods, by examining infinitely long sequences, performing computer simulations, and analyzing a real data set. The results suggest that when there are transition/transversion rate biases and base/codon frequency biases, previously described approximate methods for estimating the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio may involve serious biases, and the bias can be both positive and negative. The new method is, in general, superior to earlier approximate methods and may be useful for analyzing large data sets, although maximum likelihood appears to always be the method of choice.

N2  - Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi form symbioses with the roots of members of the Ericales. Although only two genera have been identified in culture, the taxonomic diversity of ericoid symbionts is certainly wider. Genetic variation among 40 ericoid fungal isolates was investigated in this study. PCR amplification of the nuclear small-subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) and of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), followed by sequencing, led to the discovery of DNA insertions of various sizes in the SSU rDNA of most isolates. They reached sizes of almost 1,800 bp and occurred in up to five different insertion sites. Their positions and sizes were generally correlated with morphological and ITS-RFLP grouping of the isolates, although some insertions were found to be optional among isolates of the same species, and insertions were not always present in all SSU rDNA repeats within an isolate. Most insertions were identified as typical group I introns, possessing the conserved motifs characteristic of this group. However, other insertions lack these motifs and form a distinct group that includes other fungal ribosomal introns. Alignments with almost 70 additional sequences from fungal nuclear SSU rDNA introns indicate that introns inserted at the same site along the rDNA gene are generally homologous, but they also suggest the possibility of some horizontal transfers. Two of the ericoid fungal introns showed strong homology with a conserved motif found in endonuclease genes from nuclear rDNA introns.

N2  - The complete mitochondrial (mt) genome of the mole Talpa europaea was sequenced and included in phylogenetic analyses together with another lipotyphlan (insectivore) species, the hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus, and 22 other eutherian species plus three outgroup taxa (two marsupials and a monotreme). The phylogenetic analyses reconstructed a sister group relationship between the mole and the fruit bat Artibeus jamaicensis (order Chiroptera). The Talpa/Artibeus clade constitutes a sister clade of the cetferungulates, a clade including Cetacea, Artiodactyla, Perissodactyla, and Carnivora. A monophyletic relationship between the hedgehog and the mole was significantly rejected by maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood. Consistent with current systematic schemes, analyses of complete cytochrome b genes including the shrew Sorex araneus (family Soricidae) revealed a close relationship between Talpidae and Soricidae. The analyses of complete mtDNAs, along with the findings of other insectivore studies, challenge the maintenance of the order Lipotyphla as a taxonomic unit and support the elevation of the Soricomorpha (with the families Talpidae and Soricidae and possibly also the Solenodontidae and Tenrecidae) to the level of an order, as previously proposed in some morphological studies.

N2  - To determine whether gene expression patterns affect mutation rates and/or selection intensity in mammalian genes, we studied the relationships between substitution rates and tissue distribution of gene expression. For this purpose, we analyzed 2,400 human/rodent and 834 mouse/rat orthologous genes, and we measured (using expressed sequence tag data) their expression patterns in 19 tissues from three development states. We show that substitution rates at nonsynonymous sites are strongly negatively correlated with tissue distribution breadth: almost threefold lower in ubiquitous than in tissue-specific genes. Nonsynonymous substitution rates also vary considerably according to the tissues: the average rate is twofold lower in brain-, muscle-, retina- and neuron-specific genes than in lymphocyte-, lung-, and liver-specific genes. Interestingly, 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) show exactly the same trend. These results demonstrate that the expression pattern is an essential factor in determining the selective pressure on functional sites in both coding and noncoding regions. Conversely, silent substitution rates do not vary with expression pattern, even in ubiquitously expressed genes. This latter result thus suggests that synonymous codon usage is not constrained by selection in mammals. Furthermore, this result also indicates that there is no reduction of mutation rates in genes expressed in the germ line, contrary to what had been hypothesized based on the fact that transcribed DNA is more efficiently repaired than nontranscribed DNA.

N2  - Presented here is an analysis of the molecular evolutionary dynamics of the P gene among 76 representative sequences of the Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae RNA virus families. In a number of Paramyxoviridae taxa, as well as in vesicular stomatitis viruses of the Rhabdoviridae, the P gene encodes multiple proteins from a single genomic RNA sequence. These products include the phosphoprotein (P), as well as the C and V proteins. The complexity of the P gene makes it an intriguing locus to study from an evolutionary perspective. Amino acid sequence alignments of the proteins encoded at the P and N loci were used in independent phylogenetic reconstructions of the Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae families. P-gene-coding capacities were mapped onto the Paramyxoviridae phylogeny, and the most parsimonious path of multiple-coding-capacity evolution was determined. Levels of amino acid variation for Paramyxoviridae and Rhabdoviridae P-gene-encoded products were also analyzed. Proteins encoded in overlapping reading frames from the same nucleotides have different levels of amino acid variation. The nucleotide architecture that underlies the amino acid variation was determined in order to evaluate the role of selection in the evolution of the P gene overlapping reading frames. In every case, the evolution of one of the proteins encoded in the overlapping reading frames has been constrained by negative selection while the other has evolved more rapidly. The integrity of the overlapping reading frame that represents a derived state is generally maintained at the expense of the ancestral reading frame encoded by the same nucleotides. The evolution of such multicoding sequences is likely a response by RNA viruses to selective pressure to maximize genomic information content while maintaining small genome size. The ability to evolve such a complex genomic strategy is intimately related to the dynamics of the viral quasispecies, which allow enhanced exploration of the adaptive landscape.

N2  - We report a contiguous region of more than half (>7,500 nt) of the mitochondrial genomes for Platynereis dumerii (Annelida: Polychaeta), Helobdella robusta (Annelida: Hirudinida), and Galathealinum brachiosum (Pogonophora: Perviata). The relative arrangements of all 22 genes identified for Helobdella and Galathealinum are identical to one another and to their arrangements in the mtDNA of the previously studied oligochaete annelid Lumbricus. In contrast, Platynereis differs from these taxa in the positions of several tRNA genes and in having two additional tRNA genes (trnC and trnM) and a large noncoding sequence in this region. Comparisons of relative gene arrangements and of the nucleotide and inferred amino acid sequences among these and other published taxa provide strong support for an annelid-mollusk clade that excludes arthropods, and for the inclusion of pogonophorans within Annelida, rather than giving them separate phylum status. Gene arrangement comparisons include the first use of a recently described method on previously unpublished data. Although a variety of alternative initiation codons are typically used by mitochondrial protein-encoding genes, ATG appears to be the initiator for all but one reported here. The large noncoding region (1,091 nt) identified in Platynereis has no significant sequence similarity to the noncoding region of Lumbricus, although each contains runs of TA dinucleotides and of homopolymers, which could potentially serve as signaling elements. There is strong bias for synonymous codon usage in Helobdella and especially in Galathealinum. In this latter taxon, 5 codons are completely unused, 13 are used three or fewer times, and G appears at third codon positions in only 26 of the 2,236 codons. Nucleotide composition bias appears to influence amino acid composition of the proteins.

N2  - The organization of the mitochondrial genome is generally very conserved among vertebrates. Because of this, examination of the rare rearrangements which do occur has been suggested as offering a powerful alternative to phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences. Here, we report on an avian mitochondrial rearrangement in a group of oscine passerines (warblers of the genus Phylloscopus). This rearrangement is identical to the mitochondrial organization recently identified in representatives of four orders of birds, including subsoscine Passeriformes. The rearrangement involves the movement of three genes (tRNA, NADH6, and tRNA) from their normal position in birds between tRNA and the control region (CR), to a new location between the CR and a novel, supposedly noncoding (NC), region. Our results suggest that this derived arrangement cannot be used to distinguish between suboscine and oscine passerines, as it has multiple origins both within Passeriformes and within birds as a whole. We found short stretches of DNA with high degrees of similarity between the CR and each NC region, respectively, all of which could be located in the same area of the CR. This suggests that the CR and the NC region are homologous and that the mechanism behind this mitochondrial rearrangement is a tandem duplication followed by multiple deletions. However, the similarities between the control and NC regions of each species were less pronounced than those between the control or NC regions from the different species, supporting the hypothesis of a single basal rearrangement in the Phylloscopus warblers.

N2  - The lipocalins are a family of extracellular proteins that bind and transport small hydrophobic molecules. They are found in eubacteria and a great variety of eukaryotic cells, in which they play diverse physiological roles. We report here the detection of two new eukaryotic lipocalins and a phylogenetic analysis of 113 lipocalin family members performed with maximum-likelihood and parsimony methods on their amino acid sequences. Lipocalins segregate into 13 monophyletic clades, some of which are grouped in well-supported superclades. An examination of the G+C content of the bacterial lipocalin genes and the detection of four new conceptual lipocalins in other eubacterial species argue against a recent horizontal transfer as the origin of prokaryotic lipocalins. Therefore, we rooted our lipocalin tree using the clade containing the prokaryotic lipocalins. The topology of the rooted lipocalin tree is in general agreement with the currently accepted view of the organismal phylogeny of arthropods and chordates. The rooted tree allows us to assign polarity to character changes and suggests a plausible scenario for the evolution of important lipocalin properties. More recently evolved lipocalins tend to (1) show greater rates of amino acid substitutions, (2) have more flexible protein structures, (3) bind smaller hydrophobic ligands, and (4) increase the efficiency of their ligand-binding contacts. Finally, we found that the family of fatty-acid-binding proteins originated from the more derived lipocalins and therefore cannot be considered a sister group of the lipocalin family.

N2  - By amplification and sequencing of RH gene intron 4 of various primates we demonstrate that an Alu-Sx-like element has been inserted in the RH gene of the common ancestor of humans, apes, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys. The study of mouse and lemur intron 4 sequences allowed us to precisely define the insertion point of the Alu-Sx element in intron 4 of the RH gene ancestor common to Anthropoidea. Like humans, chimpanzees and gorillas possess two types of RH intron 4, characterized by the presence (human RHCE and ape RHCE-like genes) or absence (human RHD and ape RHD-like genes) of the Alu-Sx element. This led us to conclude that in the RH common ancestor of humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas, a duplication of the common ancestor gene gave rise to two genes, one differing from the other by a 654-bp deletion encompassing an Alu-Sx element. Moreover, most of chimpanzees and some gorillas possess two types of RHD-like intron 4. The introns 4 of type 1 have a length similar to that of human RHD intron 4, whereas introns 4 of type 2 display an insertion of 12 bp. The latest insertion was not found in the human genome (72 individuals tested). The study of RH intron 3 length polymorphism confirmed that, like humans, chimpanzees and gorillas possess two types of intron 3, with the RHD-type intron 3 being 289 bases shorter than the RHCE intron 3. By amplification and sequencing of regions encompassing introns 3 and 4, we demonstrated that chimpanzee and gorilla RH-like genes displayed associations of introns 3 and 4 distinct to those found in man. Altogether, the results demonstrate that, as in humans, chimpanzee and gorilla RH genes experienced intergenic exchanges.

N2  - Most of the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gene and a part of nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA gene were sequenced for 14 species of ground beetles belonging to the genus Leptocarabus. In both the ND5 and the 28S rDNA phylogenetic trees of Leptocarabus, three major lineages were recognized: (1) L. marcilhaci/L. yokoae/Leptocarabus sp. from China, (2) L. koreanus/L. truncaticollis/L. seishinensis/L. semiopacus/L. canaliculatus/L. kurilensis from the northern Eurasian continent including Korea and Hokkaido, Japan, and (3) all of the Japanese species except L. kurilensis. Clustering of the species in the trees is largely linked to their geographic distribution and does not correlate with morphological characters. The species belonging to different species groups are clustered in the same lineages, and those in the same species group are scattered among the different lineages. One of the possible interpretations of the present results would be that morphological transformations independently took place in the different lineages, sometimes with accompanying parallel morphological evolution, resulting in the occurrence of the morphological species belonging to the same species group (=type) in the different lineages.

N2  - Classical T cells, those with αβ T-cell receptors (TCRs), are an important component of the dominant paradigm for self-nonself immune recognition in vertebrates. αβ T cells recognize foreign peptide antigens when they are bound to MHC molecules on the surfaces of antigen-presenting cells. γδ T cells bear a similar receptor, and it is often assumed that these T cells also require specialized antigen-presenting molecules for immune recognition, which we term "indirect antigen recognition." B-cell receptors, or immunoglobulins, bind directly to antigens without the help of a specialized antigen-presenting molecule. Phylogenetically, it has been assumed that T-cell receptors and the genes that encode them are a monophyletic group, and that "indirect" antigen recognition evolved before the split into two types of TCR. Recently, however, it has been proposed that γδ-TCRs bind directly to antigens, as do immunoglobulins (Ig's). This calls into question the null hypothesis that indirect antigen recognition is a common characteristic of TCRs and, by extension, the hypothesis that all TCR gene sequences form a monophyletic group. To determine whether alternative explanations for antigen recognition and other historical relationships among TCR genes might be possible, we performed phylogenetic analyses on amino acid sequences of the constant and variable regions which encode the basic subunits of TCR and Ig molecules. We used both maximum-parsimony and genetic distance-based methods and could find no strong support for the hypothesis of TCR monophyly. Analyses of the constant region suggest that TCR γ or δ sequences are the most ancient, implying that the ancestral immune cell was like a modern γδ T cell. From this γδ-like ancestor arose αβ T cells and B cells, implying that indirect antigen recognition is indeed a derived property of αβ-TCRs. Analyses of the variable regions are complicated by strong selection on antigen-binding sequences, but imply that direct antigen binding is the ancestral condition.

These estimators summarize the data using the number of distinct haplotypes and the estimated minimum number of recombination events, then calculate the value of C that maximizes the likelihood of obtaining the summarized data. They are compared with a number of previously proposed estimators of the recombination rate. One of the newly proposed estimators is generally better than the others for the parameter values considered here, while the three programs that calculate maximum-likelihood estimates give conflicting results.

N2  - An information theoretic approach is used to examine the magnitude and origin of associations among amino acid sites in the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors. Entropy and mutual information values are used to summarize the variability and covariability of amino acids comprising the bHLH domain for 242 sequences. When these quantitative measures are integrated with crystal structure data and summarized using helical wheels, they provide important insights into the evolution of three-dimensional structure in these proteins. We show that amino acid sites in the bHLH domain known to pack against each other have very low entropy values, indicating little residue diversity at these contact sites. Noncontact sites, on the other hand, exhibit significantly larger entropy values, as well as statistically significant levels of mutual information or association among sites. High levels of mutual information indicate significant amounts of intercorrelation among amino acid residues at these various sites. Using computer simulations based on a parametric bootstrap procedure, we are able to partition the observed covariation among various amino acid sites into that arising from phylogenetic (common ancestry) and stochastic causes and those resulting from structural and functional constraints. These results show that a significant amount of the observed covariation among amino acid sites is due to structural/functional constraints, over and above the covariation arising from phylogenetic constraints. These quantitative analyses provide a highly integrated evolutionary picture of the multidimensional dynamics of sequence diversity and protein structure.

N2  - DNA sequence polymorphism and divergence was examined in the vicinity of the human β-globin gene cluster origin of replication initiation region (IR), a 1.3-kb genomic region located immediately 5' of the adult-expressed β-globin gene. DNA sequence variation in the replication origin IR and 5 kb of flanking DNA was surveyed in samples drawn from two populations, one African (from the Gambia, West Africa) and the other European (from Oxford, England). In these samples, levels of nucleotide and length polymorphism in the IR were found to be more than two times as high as adjacent non-IR-associated regions (estimates of per-nucleotide heterozygosity were 0.30% and 0.12%, respectively). Most polymorphic positions identified in the origin IR fall within or just adjacent to a 52-bp alternating purine-pyrimidine ((RY)n) sequence repeat. Within- and between-population divergence is highest in this portion of the IR, and interspecific divergence in the same region, determined by comparison with an orthologous sequence from the chimpanzee, is also pronounced. Higher levels of diversity in this subregion are not, however, primarily attributable to slippage-mediated repeat unit changes, as nucleotide substitution contributes disproportionately to allelic heterogeneity. An estimate of helical stability in the sequenced region suggests that the hypervariable (RY)n constitutes the major DNA unwinding element (DUE) of the replication origin IR, the location at which the DNA duplex first unwinds and new strand synthesis begins. These findings suggest that the β-globin IR experiences a higher underlying rate of neutral mutation than do adjacent genomic regions and that enzyme fidelity associated with the initiation of DNA replication at this origin may be compromised. The significance of these findings for our understanding of eukaryotic replication origin biology is discussed.

N2  - We introduce a distance-based phylogeny reconstruction method called "weighted neighbor joining," or "Weighbor" for short. As in neighbor joining, two taxa are joined in each iteration; however, the Weighbor criterion for choosing a pair of taxa to join takes into account that errors in distance estimates are exponentially larger for longer distances. The criterion embodies a likelihood function on the distances, which are modeled as correlated Gaussian random variables with different means and variances, computed under a probabilistic model for sequence evolution. The Weighbor criterion consists of two terms, an additivity term and a positivity term, that quantify the implications of joining the pair. The first term evaluates deviations from additivity of the implied external branches, while the second term evaluates confidence that the implied internal branch has a positive branch length. Compared with maximum-likelihood phylogeny reconstruction, Weighbor is much faster, while building trees that are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Weighbor appears to be relatively immune to the "long branches attract" and "long branch distracts" drawbacks observed with neighbor joining, BIONJ, and parsimony.

N2  - Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) are essential to glycolysis, the major route of carbohydrate breakdown in eukaryotes. In animals and other heterotrophic eukaryotes, both enzymes are localized in the cytosol; in photosynthetic eukaryotes, GAPDH and TPI exist as isoenzymes that function in the glycolytic pathway of the cytosol and in the Calvin cycle of chloroplasts. Here, we show that diatoms--photosynthetic protists that acquired their plastids through secondary symbiotic engulfment of a eukaryotic rhodophyte--possess an additional isoenzyme each of both GAPDH and TPI. Surprisingly, these new forms are expressed as an TPI-GAPDH fusion protein which is imported into mitochondria prior to its assembly into a tetrameric bifunctional enzyme complex. Homologs of this translational fusion are shown to be conserved and expressed also in nonphotosynthetic, heterokont-flagellated oomycetes. Phylogenetic analyses show that mitochondrial GAPDH and its N-terminal TPI fusion branch deeply within their respective eukaryotic protein phylogenies, suggesting that diatom mitochondria may have retained an ancestral state of glycolytic compartmentation that existed at the onset of mitochondrial symbiosis. These findings strongly support the view that nuclear genes for enzymes of glycolysis in eukaryotes were acquired from mitochondrial genomes and provide new insights into the evolutionary history (host-symbiont relationships) of diatoms and other heterokont-flagellated protists.

N2  - Since branch lengths provide important information about the timing and the extent of evolutionary divergence among taxa, accurate resolution of evolutionary history depends as much on branch length estimates as on recovery of the correct topology. However, the empirical relationship between the choice of genes to sequence and the quality of branch length estimation remains ill defined. To address this issue, we evaluated the accuracy of branch lengths estimated from subsets of the mitochondrial genome for a mammalian phylogeny with known subordinal relationships. Using maximum-likelihood methods, we estimated branch lengths from an 11-kb sequence of all 13 protein-coding genes and compared them with estimates from single genes (0.2-1.8 kb) and from 7 different combinations of genes (2-3.5 kb). For each sequence, we separated the component of the log-likelihood deviation due to branch length differences associated with alternative topologies from that due to those that are independent of the topology. Even among the sequences that recovered the same tree topology, some produced significantly better branch length estimates than others did. The combination of correct topology and significantly better branch length estimation suggests that these gene combinations may prove useful in estimating phylogenetic relationships for mammalian divergences below the ordinal level. Thus, the proper choice of genes to sequence is a critical factor for reliable estimation of evolutionary history from molecular data.

N2  - We previously reported that the Na/K-ATPase α1 subunit coding gene showed signs of being a very polymorphic locus in Artemia franciscana. This species is adapted to highly saline waters, and the Na/K-ATPase α1 isoform presumably plays a key role in this adaptation. Therefore, we were interested in further study of theα 1 Na/K-ATPase polymorphisms to examine whether they might be due to an adaptation to salt resistance driven by natural selection. Using coding sequences from 10 genomic clones and 3 cDNAs, we observed that most substitutions are in synonymous positions (88.8%). The 12 nonsynonymous substitutions code for conservative amino acid replacements with an apparent scattered distribution across functional domains of the protein. Interspecific comparison between these sequences and two genomic clones from Artemia parthenogenetica containing 1,122 bp of theα 1 Na/K-ATPase locus coding sequence showed independence of the synonymous/nonsynonymous ratio in the comparison within A. franciscana and between A. franciscana and A. parthenogenetica, which fits the neutral model of evolution. Since there were no previous studies on DNA polymorphism for other A. franciscana genes, we also studied variability at the Actin 302 locus for comparison. Both loci were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and 20 sequences were obtained for each. This study shows that the amplified region of theα 1 Na/K-ATPase gene is 3.5 times as polymorphic as the Actin 302 gene and 2.9 times as heterozygotic. Interestingly, under a model of neutral evolution, the data observed would be expected with a probability of approximately 0.05, suggesting an excess of intraspecific variation ofα 1 Na/K-ATPase with respect to Actin 302. Restriction fragment length polymorphism studies show similar patterns of polymorphism along the ~41-kb span of theα 1 Na/K-ATPase locus. Most of the nucleotide differences are linked in a few haplotypes, although recombination events are also inferred from the data. We propose a possible explanation for the high polymorphic levels at theα 1 Na/K-ATPase locus which invokes positive selection acting tightly to the locus in transiently isolated or semi-isolated subpopulations.

N2  - Anaerobic heterotrichous ciliates (Armophoridae and Clevelandellidae) possess hydrogenosomes that generate molecular hydrogen and ATP. This intracellular source of hydrogen provides the basis for a stable endosymbiotic association with methanogenic archaea. We analyzed the SSU rRNA genes of 18 heterotrichous anaerobic ciliates and their methanogenic endosymbionts in order to unravel the evolution of this mutualistic association. Here, we show that the anaerobic heterotrichous ciliates constitute at least three evolutionary lines. One group consists predominantly of gut-dwelling ciliates, and two to three, potentially four, additional clades comprise ciliates that thrive in freshwater sediments. Their methanogenic endosymbionts belong to only two different taxa that are closely related to free-living methanogenic archaea from the particular ecological niches. The close phylogenetic relationships between the endosymbionts and free-living methanogenic archaea argue for multiple acquisitions from environmental sources, notwithstanding the strictly vertical transmission of the endosymbionts. Since phylogenetic analysis of the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA genes of the hydrogenosomes of these ciliates indicates a descent from the mitochondria of aerobic ciliates, it is likely that anaerobic heterotrichous ciliates hosted endosymbiotic methanogens prior to their radiation. Therefore, our data strongly suggest multiple acquisitions and replacements of endosymbiotic methanogenic archaea during their host's adaptation to the various ecological niches.

N2  - Microsatellite persistence time and evolutionary change was studied among five species of pines, which included a pair of closely related species (Pinus sylvestris and Pinus resinosa) in the subgenus Pinus, their relative Pinus radiata, and another closely related species pair (Pinus strobus and Pinus lambertiana) in the subgenus Strobus. The effective population sizes of these species are known to have ranged from the very small bottlenecks of P. resinosa to vast populations of P. sylvestris. This background allowed us to place the microsatellite evolution in a well-defined phylogenetic setting. Of 30 loci originating from P. strobus and P. radiata, we were able to consistently amplify 4 in most of the these pine species. These priming sites had been conserved for over 100 Myr. The four microsatellites were sequenced in the five species. Flanking sequences were compared to establish that the loci were orthologous. All microsatellites had persisted in these species, despite very different population sizes. We found a recent microsatellite duplication: a closely related pair of loci in P. strobus, where the other four species had just one locus. On two independent occasions, the repeat area of this same microsatellite (locus RPS 105a/b) had grown from a very low repeat number to 15 or 17 in the last 10-25 Myr. Other parts of the same compound microsatellite had remained virtually unchanged. Locus PR 4.6 is known to be polymorphic in both P. radiata and P. sylvestris, but the polymorphism in the two species is due to different motifs. The very large pine genomes are highly repetitive, and microsatellite loci also occur as gene families.

N2  - The complete sequence (14,189 bp) of the mitochondrial DNA of the opisthobranch gastropod Pupa strigosa was determined. The genome contains 13 protein, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes typical of metazoan mtDNA. The Pupa mitochondrial genome is highly compact and shows the following unusual features, like pulmonate land snails: (1) extremely small genome size, (2) absence of lengthy noncoding regions (with the largest intergenic spacer being only 46 nt), (3) size reduction of encoded genes, and (4) many overlapping genes. Several tRNA genes exhibit bizarre secondary structures with reduced T or D stems, and many tRNA genes have unstable acceptor stems that might be corrected by posttranscriptional RNA editing. The Pupa mitochondrial gene arrangement is almost identical to those of pulmonate land snails but is radically divergent from those of the prosobranch gastropod Littorina saxatilis and other molluscs. Our finding that the unique gene arrangement and highly compact genome organization are shared between opisthobranch and pulmonate gastropods strongly suggests their close phylogenetic affinity.

N2  - Protamines are small, highly basic DNA-binding proteins found in the sperm of animals. Interestingly, the proportion of arginine residues in one type of protamine, protamine P1, is about 50% in mammals. Upon closer examination, it was found that both the total number of amino acids and the positions of arginine residues have changed considerably during the course of mammalian evolution. This evolutionary pattern suggests that protamine P1 is under an unusual form of purifying selection, in which the high proportion of arginine residues is maintained but the positions may vary. In this case, we would expect that the rate of nonsynonymous substitution is not particularly low compared with that of synonymous substitution, despite purifying selection. We would also expect that the selection for a high arginine content results in a high frequency of the nucleotide G in the coding region of this gene, because all six arginine codons contain at least one G. These expectations were confirmed in our study of mammalian protamine genes. Analysis of nonmammalian vertebrate genes also showed essentially the same patterns of evolutionary changes, suggesting that this unusual form of purifying selection has been active since the origin of bony vertebrates. The protamine gene of an insect species shows similar patterns, although its purifying selection is less intense. These observations suggest that arginine-rich selection is a general feature of protamine evolution. The driving force for arginine-rich selection appears to be the DNA-binding function of protamine P1 and an interaction with a protein kinase in the fertilized egg.

N2  - Intragenomic variation in ITS1 and ITS2 is known to exist but is widely ignored in phylogenetic studies using these gene regions. The amount of variation in seven crayfish species, including three populations of Orconectes luteus and two of Procambarus clarkii, was assessed by sequencing 3, 5, or 10 clones from the same individuals, for a total of 77 sequences. The ITS1 and ITS2 sequences reported here are some of the longest known, with aligned lengths of 760 and 1,300 bp, respectively. They contain multiple microsatellite insertions, all of which show considerable intragenomic variation in the number of repeat elements. This variation is enough to obscure phylogenetic relationships at the population level, although relationships between species can be estimated. Given the hybridization techniques used to locate microsatellites, multiple-copy regions like ITS1 and ITS2 will be preferentially found if they contain microsatellites, and in these cases the microsatellites will not behave as typical Mendelian markers and could give spurious results.

N2  - α -Mannosidase enzymes comprise a class of gylcoside hydrolases involved in the maturation and degradation of glycoprotein-linked oligosaccharides. Various α-mannosidase enzymatic activities are encoded by an ancient and ubiquitous gene superfamily. A comparative sequence analysis was employed here to characterize the evolutionary relationships and dynamics of the α-mannosidase superfamily. A series of lineage-specific BLAST searches recovered the first ever recognized archaean and eubacterial α-mannosidase sequences, in addition to numerous eukaryotic sequences. Motif-based alignment and subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the entire superfamily revealed the presence of three well-supported monophyletic clades that represent discrete α-mannosidase families. The comparative method was used to evaluate the phylogenetic distribution of α-mannosidase functional variants within families. Results of this analysis demonstrate a pattern of functional diversification of α-mannosidase paralogs followed by conservation of function among orthologs. Nucleotide polymorphism among the most closely related pair of duplicated genes was analyzed to evaluate the role of natural selection in the functional diversification of α-mannosidase paralogs. Ratios of nonsynonymous and synonymous variation show an increase in the rate of nonsynonymous change after duplication and a relative excess of fixed nonsynonymous changes between the two groups of paralogs. These data point to a possible role for positive Darwinian selection in the evolution of α-mannosidase functional diversification following gene duplication.

N2  - The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that variation within species is inversely related to the strength of purifying selection, but the strength of purifying selection itself must be related to physical constraints imposed by protein folding and function. In this paper, we analyzed five enzymes for which polymorphic sequence variation within Escherichia coli and/or Salmonella enterica was available, along with a protein structure. Single and multivariate logistic regression models are presented that evaluate amino acid size, physicochemical properties, solvent accessibility, and secondary structure as predictors of polymorphism. A model that contains a positive coefficient of association between polymorphism and solvent accessibility and separate intercepts for each secondary-structure element is sufficient to explain the observed variation in polymorphism between sites. The model predicts an increase in the probability of amino acid polymorphism with increasing solvent accessibility for each protein regardless of physicochemical properties, secondary-structure element, or size of the amino acid. This result, when compared with the distribution of synonymous polymorphism, which shows no association with solvent accessibility, suggests a strong decrease in purifying selection with increasing solvent accessibility.

N2  - Glutamine synthetase exists in at least two related forms, GSI and GSII, the sequences of which have been used in evolutionary molecular clock studies. GSI has so far been found exclusively in bacteria, and GSII has been found predominantly in eukaryotes. To date, only a minority of bacteria, including rhizobia, have been shown to express both forms of GS. The sequences of equivalent internal fragments of the GSI and GSII genes for the type strains of 16 species of rhizobia have been determined and analyzed. The GSI and GSII data sets do not produce congruent phylogenies with either neighbor-joining or maximum-likelihood analyses. The GSI phylogeny is broadly congruent with the 16S rDNA phylogeny for the same bacteria; the GSII phylogeny is not. There are three striking rearrangements in the GSII phylograms, all of which might be explained by horizontal gene transfer to Bradyrhizobium (probably from Mesorhizobium), to Rhizobium galegae (from Rhizobium), and to Mesorhizobium huakuii (perhaps from Rhizobium). There is also evidence suggesting intrageneric DNA transfer within Mesorhizobium. Meta-analysis of both GS genes from the different genera of rhizobia and other reference organisms suggests that the divergence times of the different rhizobium genera predate the existence of legumes, their host plants.

N2  - Several distinct families of endogenous retrovirus-like elements (ERVs) exist in the genomes of primates. Despite the important evolutionary consequences that carrying these intragenomic parasites may have for their hosts, our knowledge about their evolution is still scarce. A matter of particular interest is whether evolution of ERVs occurs via a master lineage or through several lineages coexisting over long periods of time. In this work, the paleogenomic approach has been applied to the study of the evolution of ERV9, one of the human endogenous retrovirus families mobilized during primate evolution. By searching the GenBank database with the first 676 bp of the ERV9 long terminal repeat, we identified 156 different element insertions into the human genome. These elements were grouped into 14 subfamilies based on several characteristic nucleotide differences. The age of each subfamily was roughly estimated based on the average sequence divergence of its members from the subfamily consensus sequence. Determination of the sequential order of diagnostic substitutions led to the identification of four distinct lineages, which retained their capacity of transposition over extended periods of evolution. Strong evidence for mosaic evolution of some of these lineages is presented. Taken altogether, the available data indicate that the possibility of ERV9 still being active in the human lineage can not be discarded.

N2  - Coding sequences of the paralogous FUT1 (H), FUT2 (Se), and Sec1 α2-fucosyltransferase genes were obtained from different primate species. Analysis of the primate FUT1-like and FUT2-like sequences revealed the absence of the known human inactivating mutations giving rise to the h null alleles of FUT1 and the se null alleles of FUT2. Therefore, most primate FUT1-like and FUT2-like genes potentially code for functional enzymes. The Sec1-like gene encodes for a potentially functional α2-fucosyltransferase enzyme in nonprimate mammals, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys, but it has been inactivated by a nonsense mutation at codon 325 in the ancestor of humans and African apes (gorillas, chimpanzees). Human and gorilla Sec1's have, in addition, two deletions and one insertion, respectively, 5' of the nonsense mutation leading to proteins shorter than chimpanzee Sec1. Phylogenetic analysis of the available H, Se, and Sec1 mammalian protein sequences demonstrates the existence of three clusters which correspond to the three genes. This suggests that the differentiation of the three genes is rather old and predates the great mammalian radiation. The phylogenetic analysis also suggests that Sec1 has a higher evolutionary rate than FUT2 and FUT1. Finally, we show that an Alu-Y element was inserted in intron 1 of the FUT1 ancestor of humans and apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and gibbons); this Alu-Y element has not been found in monkeys or nonprimate mammals, which lack ABH antigens on red cells. A potential mechanism leading to the red cell expression of the H enzyme in primates, related to the insertion of this Alu-Y sequence, is proposed.

The strong similarity between different glycosyl hydrolases of rumen fungi and bacteria suggests that most, if not all, of the glycosyl hydrolases of rumen fungi that play an important role in the degradation of cellulose and other plant polysaccharides were acquired by horizontal gene transfer events. This acquisition allows fungi to establish a habitat within a new environmental niche: the rumen of the herbivorous mammals for which cellulose and plant hemicellulose constitute the main raw nutritive substrate.

N2  - A reexamination of the genome of the tomato (renamed Solanum lycopersicum L.) indicates that it contains five, or at most perhaps six, phytochrome genes (PHY), each encoding a different apoprotein (PHY). Five previously identified tomato PHY genes have been designated PHYA, PHYB1, PHYB2, PHYE, and PHYF. A molecular phylogenetic analysis is consistent with the hypothesis that the angiosperm PHY family is composed of four subfamilies (A, B, C/F, and E). Southern analyses indicate that the tomato genome does not contain both a PHYC and a PHYF. Molecular phylogenetic analyses presented here, which utilize for the first time full-length PHY sequences from two completely characterized angiosperm gene families, indicate that tomato PHYF is probably an ortholog of Arabidopsis PHYC. They also confirm that the angiosperm PHY family is undergoing relatively rapid differential evolution. Assuming PHYF is an ortholog of PHYC, PHY genes in eudicots are evolving (Ka/site) at 1.52-2.79 times the rate calculated as average for other plant nuclear genes. Again assuming PHYF is an ortholog of PHYC, the rate of evolution of the C and E subfamilies is at least 1.33 times the rate of the A and B subfamilies. PHYA and PHYB in eudicots are evolving at least 1.45 times as fast as their counterparts in the Poaceae. PHY functional domains also exhibit different evolutionary rates. The C-terminal region of angiosperm PHY (codons 800-1105) is evolving at least 2.11 times as fast as the photosensory domain (codons 200-500). The central region of a domain essential for phytochrome signal transduction (codons 652-712) is also evolving rapidly. Nonsynonymous substitutions occur in this region at 2.03-3.75 times the average rate for plant nuclear genes. It is not known if this rapid evolution results from selective pressure or from the absence of evolutionary constraint.

N2  - We investigated the tempo and mode of evolution of the primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Several different models of nucleotide substitution were tested on a general phylogenetic tree obtained using the 20 full-genome HTLV/STLV sequences available. The likelihood ratio test showed that the Tamura and Nei model with discrete γ-distributed rates among sites is the best-fitting substitution model. The heterogeneity of nucleotide substitution rates along the PTLV genome was further investigated for different genes and at different codon positions (cdp's). Tests of rate constancy showed that different PTLV lineages evolve at different rates when first and second cdp's are considered, but the molecular-clock hypothesis holds for some PTLV lineages when the third cdp is used. Negative selection was evident throughout the genome. However, in the gp46 region, a small fragment subjected to positive selection was identified using a Monte Carlo simulation based on a likelihood method. Employing correlations of the virus divergence times with anthropologically documented migrations of their host, a possible timescale was estimated for each important node of the PTLV tree. The obtained results on these slow-evolving viruses could be used to fill gaps in the historical records of some of the host species. In particular, the HTLV-I/STLV-I history might suggest a simian migration from Asia to Africa not much earlier than 19,500-60,000 years ago.

N2  - The intermediary metabolic enzyme alanine : glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT) is targeted to different organelles (mitochondria and/or peroxisomes) in different species. Possibly under the influence of dietary selection pressure, the subcellular distribution of AGT has changed on at least eight occasions during the evolution of mammals. AGT targeting is dependent on the variable use of two alternative transcription and translation initiation sites which determine whether or not the region encoding the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence is contained within the open reading frame. In the present study, we sequenced the 5' region of the AGT gene, including both ancestral translation start sites, for 11 anthropoid primates and compared the results with data already available for two others. We show that while the more 3' of the two translation start sites is maintained in all species, the more 5' site has been lost in six species (five of seven catarrhines and one of six platyrrhines). In addition, the remaining two catarrhines, which have maintained the 5' translation start site, are predicted to have lost mitochondrial targeting by a different mechanism, possibly loss of the more 5' transcription start site. Analysis of the relative frequencies of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations in the region encoding the extant or ancestral mitochondrial targeting sequences led us to suggest that there has been recent strong positive selection pressure to lose, or decrease the efficiency of, mitochondrial AGT targeting in several anthropoid lineages, and that the loss of mitochondrial targeting in this group of mammals is likely to have occurred on at least four, and possibly five, separate occasions.

We argue that the use of this principle cannot be called into question, except for computing time reasons. We show that the minimum-evolution criterion is not perfectly suited for distance data estimated from sequences, and we present another approach, implemented in the BIONJ algorithm, which allows the data features to be taken into account, while being less demanding in computing time. Simulations show that BIONJ significantly outperforms NJ.

N2  - Multiple copies of mitochondrial-like DNA were found in the brown mountain grasshopper, Podisma pedestris (Orthoptera: Acrididae), paralogous to COI and ND5 regions. The same was discovered using the ND5 regions of nine other grasshopper species from four separate subfamilies (Podisminae, Calliptaminae, Cyrtacanthacridinae, and Gomphocerinae). The extra ND5-like sequences were shown to be nuclear in the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Cyrtacanthacridinae), and probably so in P. pedestris and an Italopodisma sp. (Podisminae). Eighty-seven different ND5-like nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes (Numts) were sequenced from 12 grasshopper individuals. Different nuclear mitochondrial pseudogenes, if descended from the same mitochondrial immigrant, will have diverged from each other under no selective constraints because of their loss of functionality. Evidence of selective constraints in the differences between any two Numt sequences (e.g., if most differences are at third positions of codons) implies that they have separate mitochondrial origins. Through pairwise comparisons of pseudogene sequences, it was established that there have been at least 12 separate mtDNA integrations into P. pedestris nuclear genomes. This is the highest reported rate of horizontal transfer between organellar and nuclear genomes within a single animal species. The occurrence of numerous mitochondrial pseudogenes in nuclear genomes derived from separate integration events appears to be a common phenomenon among grasshoppers. More than one type of mechanism appears to have been involved in generating the observed grasshopper Numts.

N2  - Certain mutations are known to occur with differing frequencies on the leading and lagging strands of DNA. The extent to which these mutational biases affect the sequences of higher eukaryotes has been difficult to ascertain because the positions of most replication origins are not known, making it impossible to distinguish between the leading and lagging strands. To resolve whether strand biases influence the evolution of primate sequences, we compared the substitution patterns in noncoding regions adjacent to an origin of replication identified within the β-globin complex. Although there was limited asymmetry around the β-globin origin of replication, patterns of substitutions do not support the existence of a mutational bias between the leading and lagging strands of chromosomal DNA replication in primates.

N2  - The porB locus codes for the major outer membrane protein of Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Alleles of this locus have been assigned to two homology groups based on close sequence and immunological relationships and are designated as either PIA or PIB. Several population parameters were estimated and compared among these two groups using a data set of 22 PIA sequences and 91 PIB sequences obtained from diverse geographic localities and from time periods spanning approximately 50 years. Recombination appears to be extensive in the porB gene. While the recombination rates are similar for the PIA and PIB sequences, the relative contribution of recombination to genetic diversity is higher for the PIA sequences. Alleles belonging to the PIB group show greater genetic diversity than do those in the PIA group. Although phylogenetic analysis did not reveal temporal or geographic clustering of sequences, estimates of gene flow and the fixation index suggested that PIB sequences exhibit population substructure based on geographic locality. Selection acts in these homology groups in a different way. While positive Darwinian selection is the dominant force driving the evolution of the PIA sequences, purifying selection operates also on the PIB sequences. These differences may be attributable to the greater propensity of PIA strains, as compared with PIB strains, to cause disseminated gonococcal infection, which would expose the former to intense selection pressure from the host immune system. The molecular evolution of Neisseria gonorrhoeae seems to be driven by the simultaneous action of selection and recombination, but under different rates and selection pressures for the PIA and PIB homology groups.

N2  - Mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence data from 15 species of herons (Aves: Ardeidae), representing 13 genera, were compared with DNA hybridization data of single-copy nuclear DNA (scnDNA) from the same species in a taxonomic congruence assessment of heron phylogeny. The two data sets produced a partially resolved, completely congruent estimate of phylogeny with the following basic structure: (Tigrisoma, Cochlearius, (((Zebrilus, (Ixobrychus, Botaurus)), (((Ardea, Casmerodius), Bubulcus), ((Egretta thula, Egretta caerulea, Egretta tricolor), Syrigma), Butorides, Nycticorax, Nyctanassa)))). Because congruence indicated similar phylogenetic information in the two data sets, we used the relatively unsaturated DNA hybridization distances as surrogates of time to examine graphically the patterns and rates of change in cytochrome b distances. Cytochrome b distances were computed either from whole sequences or from partitioned sequences consisting of transitions, transversions, specific codon site positions, or specific protein-coding regions. These graphical comparisons indicated that unpartitioned cytochrome b has evolved at 5-10 times the rate of scnDNA. Third-position transversions appeared to offer the most useful sequence partition for phylogenetic analysis because of their relatively fast rate of substitution (two times that of scnDNA) and negligible saturation. We also examined lineage-based rates of evolution by comparing branch length patterns between the nuclear and cytochrome b trees. The degree of correlation in corresponding branch lengths between cytochrome b and DNA hybridization trees depended on DNA sequence partitioning. When cytochrome b sequences were not partitioned, branch lengths in the cytochrome b and DNA hybridization trees were not correlated. However, when cytochrome b sequences were reduced to third-position transversions (i.e., unsaturated, relatively fast changing data), branch lengths were correlated. This finding suggests that lineage-based rates of DNA evolution in nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are influenced by common causes.

N2  - The traditional view of avian evolution places ratites and tinamous at the base of the phylogenetic tree of modern birds (Neornithes). In contrast, most recent molecular studies suggest that neognathous perching birds (Passeriformes) compose the oldest lineage of modern birds. Here, we report significant molecular support for the traditional view of neognath monophyly based on sequence analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (4.4 kb) from every modern avian order. Phylogenetic analyses further show that the ducks and gallinaceous birds are each other's closest relatives and together form the basal lineage of neognathous birds. To investigate why other molecular studies sampling fewer orders have reached different conclusions regarding neognath monophyly, we performed jackknife analyses on our mitochondrial data. Those analyses indicated taxon-sampling effects when basal galloanserine birds were included in combination with sparse taxon sampling. Our phylogenetic results suggest that the earliest neornithines were heavy-bodied, ground-dwelling, nonmarine birds. This inference, coupled with a fossil bias toward marine environments, provides a possible explanation for the large gap in the early fossil record of birds.

N2  - Male-specific proteins have increasingly been reported as targets of positive selection and are of special interest because of the role they may play in the evolution of reproductive isolation. We report the rapid interspecific divergence of cDNA encoding a major acrosomal protein of unknown function (TMAP) of sperm from five species of teguline gastropods. A mitochondrial DNA clock (calibrated by congeneric species divided by the Isthmus of Panama) estimates that these five species diverged 2-10 MYA. Inferred amino acid sequences reveal a propeptide that has diverged rapidly between species. The mature protein has diverged faster still due to high nonsynonymous substitution rates (>25 nonsynonymous substitutions per site per 10 years). cDNA encoding the mature protein (89-100 residues) shows evidence of positive selection (Dn/Ds > 1) for 4 of 10 pairwise species comparisons. cDNA and predicted secondary-structure comparisons suggest that TMAP is neither orthologous nor paralogous to abalone lysin, and thus marks a second, phylogenetically independent, protein subject to strong positive selection in free-spawning marine gastropods. In addition, an internal repeat in one species (Tegula aureotincta) produces a duplicated cleavage site which results in two alternatively processed mature proteins differing by nine amino acid residues. Such alternative processing may provide a mechanism for introducing novel amino acid sequence variation at the amino-termini of proteins. Highly divergent TMAP N-termini from two other tegulines (Tegula regina and Norrisia norrisii) may have originated by such a mechanism.

N2  - In this paper, we propose a new method (uninode coding) for coding duplicate (paralogous) genes to infer species trees. Uninode coding incorporates data from duplicated and unduplicated gene copies in phylogenetic analyses of taxa. Uninode coding utilizes global parsimony through the inclusion of both duplicated and unduplicated gene copies, allows one to code all data sources from a taxon into a single terminal, and overcomes problems of character dependence among duplicated and unduplicated gene copies. We present an example of uninode coding using the phytochrome A and phytochrome C data from a study by Donoghue and Mathews.

N2  - The mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region (CR) of dogs and wolves contains an array of imperfect 10 bp tandem repeats. This region was studied for 14 domestic dogs representing the four major phylogenetic groups of nonrepetitive CR and for 5 wolves. Three repeat types were found among these individuals, distributed so that different sequences of the repeat types were formed in different molecules. This enabled a detailed study of the arrays and of the mutation events that they undergo. Extensive heteroplasmy was observed in all individuals; 85 different array types were found in one individual, and the total number of types was estimated at 384. Among unrelated individuals, no identical molecules were found, indicating a high rate of evolution of the region. By performing a pedigree analysis, array types which had been inherited from mother to offspring and array types which were the result of somatic mutations, respectively, could be identified, showing that about 20% of the molecules within an individual had somatic mutations. By direct pairwise comparison of the mutated and the original array types, the physiognomy of the inserted or deleted elements (indels) and the approximate positions of the mutations could be determined. All mutations could be explained by replication slippage or point mutations. The majority of the indels were 1-5 repeats long, but deletions of up to 17 repeats were found. Mutations were found in all parts of the arrays, but at a higher frequency in the 5' end. Furthermore, the inherited array types within the mother-offspring pair were aligned and compared so that germ line mutations could be studied. The pattern of the germ line mutations was approximately the same as that of the somatic mutations.

N2  - Recent studies have suggested that size homoplasy is a prevalent feature of microsatellites and is expected to increase with time of divergence among populations and taxa. In this study, we performed sequence analysis of alleles from a complex microsatellite locus (Pzeb4, initially isolated from Pseudotropheus (Maylandia) zebra) from 1 midwater-feeding and 10 rock-dwelling cichlid fish species from Lake Malawi, East Africa, to investigate how widespread size homoplasy is among closely related taxa at this locus. All cichlid fishes endemic to this lake are believed to have originated within the last 700,000 years, and some species may be less than 200 years old. The number of eletromorphs found per species varied from 3 to 13. Sequence analysis of 95 cloned Pzeb4 PCR products (representing 18 electromorphs) revealed 13 new alleles. Ten of the 13 electromorphs (77%) were found to show size homoplasy due to either single nucleotide substitutions/indels or large indels. To investigate how well this locus fits the single-step mutation model (SMM), the minimum number of mutations required to explain the length differences between pairs of alleles was plotted against their size differences. Of the 300 comparisons, 166 (55.3%) corresponded to SMM expectations and 86 (28.7%) required a smaller number of mutations, and for 48 (16.0%) pairwise comparisons, a larger number of mutations were required to explain the length differences as compared with SMM expectations. Finally, a large deletion in the microsatellite sequence observed in the three rock-dwelling species Pseudotropheus lucerna, Pseudotropheus (Tropheops)  band,' and Pseudotropheus (Tropheops)  rust' and the midwater-feeding species Copadichromis sp. is believed to represent a shared ancestral polymorphism.

N2  - Remains of barley (Hordeum vulgare) grains found at archaeological sites in the Fertile Crescent indicate that about 10,000 years ago the crop was domesticated there from its wild relative Hordeum spontaneum. The domestication history of barley is revisited based on the assumptions that DNA markers effectively measure genetic distances and that wild populations are genetically different and they have not undergone significant change since domestication. The monophyletic nature of barley domestication is demonstrated based on allelic frequencies at 400 AFLP polymorphic loci studied in 317 wild and 57 cultivated lines. The wild populations from Israel-Jordan are molecularly more similar than are any others to the cultivated gene pool. The results provided support for the hypothesis that the Israel-Jordan area is the region in which barley was brought into culture. Moreover, the diagnostic allele I of the homeobox gene BKn-3, rarely but almost exclusively found in Israel H. spontaneum, is pervasive in western landraces and modern cultivated varieties. In landraces from the Himalayas and India, the BKn-3 allele IIIa prevails, indicating that an allelic substitution has taken place during the migration of barley from the Near East to South Asia. Thus, the Himalayas can be considered a region of domesticated barley diversification.

N2  - The evolutionary forces that produced the canonical genetic code before the last universal ancestor remain obscure. One hypothesis is that the arrangement of amino acid/codon assignments results from selection to minimize the effects of errors (e.g., mistranslation and mutation) on resulting proteins. If amino acid similarity is measured as polarity, the canonical code does indeed outperform most theoretical alternatives. However, this finding does not hold for other amino acid properties, ignores plausible restrictions on possible code structure, and does not address the naturally occurring nonstandard genetic codes. Finally, other analyses have shown that significantly better code structures are possible. Here, we show that if theoretically possible code structures are limited to reflect plausible biological constraints, and amino acid similarity is quantified using empirical data of substitution frequencies, the canonical code is at or very close to a global optimum for error minimization across plausible parameter space. This result is robust to variation in the methods and assumptions of the analysis. Although significantly better codes do exist under some assumptions, they are extremely rare and thus consistent with reports of an adaptive code: previous analyses which suggest otherwise derive from a misleading metric. However, all extant, naturally occurring, secondarily derived, nonstandard genetic codes do appear less adaptive. The arrangement of amino acid assignments to the codons of the standard genetic code appears to be a direct product of natural selection for a system that minimizes the phenotypic impact of genetic error. Potential criticisms of previous analyses appear to be without substance. That known variants of the standard genetic code appear less adaptive suggests that different evolutionary factors predominated before and after fixation of the canonical code. While the evidence for an adaptive code is clear, the process by which the code achieved this optimization requires further attention.

N2  - There are two competing theories about the interrelationships of craniates: the cyclostome theory assumes that lampreys and hagfishes are a clade, the cyclostomes, whose sister group is the jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes); the vertebrate theory assumes that lampreys and gnathostomes are a clade, the vertebrates, whose sister group is hagfishes. The vertebrate theory is best supported by a number of unique anatomical and physiological characters. Molecular sequence data from 18S and 28S rRNA genes rather support the cyclostome theory, but mtDNA sequence of Myxine glutinosa rather supports the vertebrate theory. Additional molecular data are thus needed to elucidate this three-taxon problem. We determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the mtDNA of the lamprey Lampetra fluviatilis. The mtDNA of L. fluviatilis possesses the same genomic organization as Petromyzon marinus, which validates this gene order as a synapomorphy of lampreys. The mtDNA sequence of L. fluviatilis was used in combination with relevant mtDNA sequences for an approach to the hagfish/lamprey relationships using the maximum-parsimony, neighbor-joining, and maximum-likelihood methods. Although trees compatible with our present knowledge of the phylogeny of craniates can be reconstructed by using the three methods, the data collected do not support the vertebrate or the cyclostome hypothesis. The present data set does not allow the resolution of this three-taxon problem, and new kinds of data, such as nuclear DNA sequences, need to be collected.

N2  - The performances of five global multiple-sequence alignment programs (CLUSTAL W, Divide and Conquer, Malign, PileUp, and TreeAlign) were evaluated using part of the animal mitochondrial small subunit (12S) rRNA molecule. Conserved sequence motifs derived from an alignment based on secondary structural information were used to score how well each program aligned a data set of five vertebrate and five invertebrate taxa over a range of parameter values. All of the programs could align the motifs with reasonable accuracy for at least one set of parameter conditions, although if the whole sequence was considered, similarity to the structural alignment was only 25%-34%. Use of small gap costs generally gave more accurate results, although Malign and TreeAlign generated longer alignments when gap costs were low. The programs differed in the consistency of the alignments when gap cost was varied; CLUSTAL W, Divide and Conquer, and TreeAlign were the most accurate and robust, while PileUp performed poorly as gap cost values increased, and the accuracy of Malign fluctuated. Default settings for the programs did not give the best results, and attempting to select similar parameter values in different programs did not always result in more similar alignments. Poor alignment of even well-conserved motifs can occur if these are near sites with insertions or deletions. Since there is no a priori way to determine gap costs and because such costs can vary over the gene, alignment of rRNA sequences, particularly the less well conserved regions, should be treated carefully and aided by secondary structure and conserved motifs. Some motifs are single bases and so are often invisible to alignment programs. Our tests involved the most conserved regions of the 12S rRNA gene, and alignment of less well conserved regions will be more problematical. None of the alignments we examined produced a fully resolved phylogeny for the data set, indicating that this portion of 12S rRNA is insufficient for resolution of distant evolutionary relationships.

N2  - The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.

N2  - Patterns of nucleotide variation consistent with the action of natural selection have been discovered at a number of different gene loci. Here, pheromone-binding proteins (PBPs) are examined to determine if selection has acted to fix amino acid changes in PBPs in lineages in which pheromone changes have occurred. PBPs from five different species of moths in the genus Choristoneura were sequenced, along with the PBP of Argyrotaenia velutinana, which serves as an outgroup. Three independent major pheromone changes are represented within this group of five Choristoneura species. Two different lineages show evidence for selection based on polymorphism and divergence comparisons and comparisons of rates of replacement evolution to silent and noncoding evolution. Along one of these lineages, leading to Choristoneura fumiferana, there has been a change to an aldehyde pheromone from an acetate pheromone. The second branch does not appear to be associated with a major pheromone change. Other branches in the tree show a trend toward greater replacement fixation than expected under neutrality. This trend could reflect undetected selective events within this group of PBPs. Selection appears to have acted to fix amino acid changes in the PBP of moths from the genus Choristoneura, but it is not clear that this selection is due to pheromone changes between species.

N2  - Previous analyses of the α-esterase cluster of Drosophila melanogaster revealed 10 active genes and the DmαE4a-Ψ pseudogene. Here, we reconstruct the evolution of the pseudogene from the sequences of 12 alleles from widely scattered D. melanogaster populations and single alleles from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila yakuba. All of the DmαE4a-Ψ alleles contain numerous inactivating mutations, suggesting that pseudogene alleles are fixed in natural populations. Several lines of evidence also suggest that DmαE4a is now evolving without selective constraint in the D. melanogaster lineage. There are three polymorphic indels which result in frameshifts; a key nucleotide of the intron splice acceptor is polymorphic; the neutral mutation parameter is the same for replacement and silent sites; one of the nonsilent polymorphisms results in a stop codon; only 1 of the 13 replacement polymorphisms is biochemically conservative; residues that are conserved among active esterases have different states in DmαE4a-Ψ; and there are about half as many transitional polymorphisms as transversional ones. In contrast, the D. simulans and D. yakuba orthologs DsαE4a and DyαE4a do not have the inactivating mutations of DmαE4a-Ψ and appear to be evolving under the purifying selection typical of protein- encoding genes. For instance, there have been more substitutions in the introns than in the exons, and more in silent sites than in replacement sites. Furthermore, most of the amino acid substitutions that have occurred between DyαE4a and DsαE4a are located in sites that typically vary among active α-esterases rather than those that are usually conserved. We argue that the originalα E4a gene had a function which it has lost since the divergence of the D. melanogaster and D. simulans lineages.

N2  - Chloroplasts contain proteins that are encoded by different genetic systems, the plastid genome and the nuclear chromosomes. By comparing the gene content of plastid genomes of different taxa, some predictions about nuclear-encoded genes for plastid proteins are possible. However, early in evolution, many genes were transferred from the plastid to the cell nucleus and are therefore missing from all known plastid genomes and escape such predictions. By sequencing the miniaturized chromosomes of the nucleomorph of the cryptophyte Guillardia theta, as well as the plastid genome, we uncovered two genes encoding CbbX which are predicted to be involved in plastid function. Our findings suggest that (1) red-type plastid rbcLS genes evolved together with cbbX, which is related to cbbX genes of purple bacteria; (2) early in rhodoplast evolution, the cbbX gene was duplicated and transferred into the nucleus; (3) the plastid-encoded LysR transcriptional activator gene, rbcR, is homologous to rbcR and cbbR transcriptional activator genes of purple bacteria and cyanobacteria; and (4) the ancestral plastid probably harbored both types of form I RuBisCo.

N2  - A detailed assessment of the evolution and phylogenetic utility of two genes, ftsZ and wsp, was used to investigate the origin of male-killing Wolbachia, previously isolated from the ladybird Adalia bipunctata and the butterfly Acraea encedon. The analysis included almost all available sequences of B-group Wolbachia and two outgroup taxa and showed that (1) the two gene regions differ in phylogenetic utility, (2) sequence variation is here correlated with phylogenetic information content, (3) both genes show significant rate heterogeneity between lineages, (4) increased substitution rates are associated with homoplasy in the data, (5) wsp sequences of some taxa appear to be subject to positive selection, and (6) only a limited number of clades can be inferred with confidence due to either lack of phylogenetic information or the presence of homoplasy. With respect to the evolution of male-killing, the two genes nevertheless seemed to provide unbiased information. However, they consistently produce contradictory results. Current data therefore do not permit clarification of the origin of this behavior. In addition, A. bipunctata was found to be a host to two recently diverged strains of male-killing Wolbachia that showed increased substitution rates for both genes. Moreover, the wsp gene, which codes for an outer membrane protein, was found to be subject to positive selection in these taxa. These findings were postulated to be the product of high selection pressures due to antagonistic host-symbiont interactions in this ladybird species. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the results of a detailed phylogenetic analysis, including characterization of the limitations of such an approach, can serve as a valuable basis for an understanding of the evolution of Wolbachia bacteria. Moreover, particular features of gene evolution, such as elevated substitution rates or the presence of positive selection, may provide information about the dynamics of Wolbachia-host associations.

T1  - Evolution of Nucleotide Substitutions and Gene Regulation in the Amylase Multigenes in Drosophila kikkawai and its Sibling Species

N2  - In order to determine evolutionary changes in gene regulation and the nucleotide substitution pattern in a multigene family, the amylase multigenes were characterized in Drosophila kikkawai and its sibling species. The nucleotide substitution pattern was investigated. Drosophila kikkawai has four amylase genes. The Amy1 and Amy2 genes are a head-to-head duplication in the middle of the B arm of the second chromosome, while the Amy3 and Amy4 genes are a tail-to-tail duplication near the centromere of the same chromosome. In the sibling species of D. kikkawai (Drosophila bocki, Drosophila leontia, and Drosophila lini), sequencing of the Amy1, Amy2, Amy3, and Amy4 genes revealed that the Amy1 and Amy2 gene group diverged from Amy3 and Amy4 after duplication. In the Amy1 and Amy2 genes, the divergent evolution occurred in the flanking regions; in contrast, the coding regions have evolved in concerted fashion. The electrophoretic pattern of AMY isozymes was also examined. In D. kikkawai and its siblings, two or three electrophoretically different isozymes are encoded by the Amy1 and Amy2 genes (S isozyme) and by the Amy3 and Amy4 genes (F (M) isozymes). The S and F (M) isozymes show different patterns of band intensity when larvae and flies were fed in different media. Amy1 and Amy2, which encode the S isozyme, are more strikingly regulated than Amy3 and Amy4, which encode the F (M) isozyme. The GC content and codon usage bias were higher for the Amy1 and Amy2 genes than for the Amy3 and Amy4 genes. Although the ratio of synonymous and replacement substitutions within the Amy1 and Amy2 gene group was not significantly different from that within the Amy3 and Amy4 gene group, the synonymous substitution rate in the lineage of Amy1 and Amy2 was lower than that of Amy3 and Amy4. In conclusion, after the first duplication but before speciation of four species, the synonymous substitution rate between the two lineages and the electrophoretic pattern of the isozymes encoded by them changed, although we do not know whether there was any evolutionary relationship between the two.

N2  - Recently, a rapidly amplifying family of mouse LINE-1 (L1) has been identified and named TF. The evolutionary context surrounding the derivation of the TF family was examined through phylogenetic analysis of sequences in the 3' portion of the repeat. The Mus musculus domesticus TF family was found to be the terminal subfamily of the previously identified L1Md4 lineage. The L1Md4 lineage joins the other prototypical mouse LINE-1 lineage (the L1MdA2 lineage) approximately 1 MYA at about the time of the common ancestor of M. m. domesticus, Mus spicilegus, and Mus spretus. However, the TF family from M. m. domesticus was found to join to the previously reported M. spretus Ms475 and Ms7024 LINE-1 families at just 0.5 MYA, indicating horizontal transfer. The TF family from M. m. domesticus was then found to be even more recently related to LINE-1's from another species, M. spicilegus. A separate spretus A2 lineage was found through a directed search of a PCR library. This lineage, in contrast to the spretus TF lineage, does join domesticus at about 1 MYA, as would be expected in the absence of horizontal transfer. A third major family was also found that splits off from the L1Md4 lineage shortly after its departure from the L1MdA2 lineage. The new family, named the Z family, was found to contain the de novo LINE-1 inserts causing the beige and med mutations. Whether the split with the Z family was before or after the recombination that introduced the F-type promoters and defined the inception of TF as a lineage is unclear. In enumerating copies of the various LINE-1 families, we found that TF 3' ends were not much more numerous than the reported number of 5' ends, suggesting that TF may not be subjected to the 90% truncation pattern typical of LINE-1 as a whole.

N2  - Most members of the ascomycetous genus Cordyceps are endoparasitic fungi of insects and other arthropods, but about 20 of the 300 described species are parasitic to hart's truffles, Elaphomyces spp. In order to understand the evolution of host specificity and the process of interkingdom host jumping in Cordyceps, we investigated the phylogenetic relationships of 22 representatives, including 4 truffle parasites and 18 insect parasites, based on nuclear and mitochondrial rDNA sequences. Five monophyletic groups were identified in both nuclear and mitochondrial phylogenies. In three of the five clades, the members utilized hosts from the same insect group, suggesting that the endoparasite-host connections have been conserved to some extent. On the other hand, it was also shown that major host shifts between distantly related insects must have occurred repeatedly. Notably, phylogenetic analyses strongly suggested that parasites of hart's truffles originated from parasites of cicada nymphs during the evolution of the Cordyceps. The common habitats of cicada nymphs and hart's truffles, deep underground and associated with tree roots, suggest that the interkingdom host jumping from Animalia to Fungi might have been promoted by the overlapping ecological niche of the unrelated hosts. This finding provides an impressive case of a drastic host shift in favor of the host habitat hypothesis.

N2  - The entire mitochondrial gene order of the crustacean Pagurus longicarpus was determined by sequencing all but approximately 300 bp of the mitochondrial genome. We report the first major gene rearrangements found in the clade including Crustacea and Insecta. At least eight mitochondrial gene rearrangements have dramatically altered the gene order of the hermit crab P. longicarpus relative to the putatively ancestral crustacean gene order. These include two rearrangements of protein-coding genes, the first reported for any nonchelicerate arthropod. Codon usage and amino acid sequences do not deviate substantially from those reported for other crustaceans. Investigating the phylogenetic distribution of these eight rearrangements will add additional characters to help resolve decapod phylogeny.

N2  - Nucleotide variation at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus (Adh) was studied in the outcrossing Arabidopsis lyrata, a close relative of the selfing Arabidopsis thaliana. Overall, estimated nucleotide diversity in the North American ssp. lyrata and two European ssp. petraea populations was 0.0038, lower than the corresponding specieswide estimate for A. thaliana at the same set of nucleotide sites. The distribution of segregating sites across the gene differed between the two species. Estimated sequence diversity within an A. lyrata population with a large sample size (0.0023) was much higher than has previously been observed for A. thaliana. This North American population has an excess of sites at intermediate frequencies compared with neutral expectation (Tajima's D = 2.3, P < 0.005), suggestive of linked balancing selection or a recent population bottleneck. In contrast, an excess of rare polymorphisms has been found in A. thaliana. Polymorphism within A. lyrata and divergence from A. thaliana appear to be correlated across the Adh gene sequence. The geographic distribution of polymorphism was quite different from that of A. thaliana, for which earlier studies of several genes found low within-population nucleotide site polymorphism and no overall continental differentiation of variation despite large differences in site frequencies between local populations. Differences between the outcrossing A. lyrata and the selfing A. thaliana reflect the impact of differences in mating system and the influence of bottlenecks in A. thaliana during rapid colonization on DNA sequence polymorphism. The influence of additional variability-reducing mechanisms, such as background selection or hitchhiking, may not be discernible.

N2  - What are the major forces governing protein evolution? A common view is that proteins with strong structural and functional requirements evolve more slowly than proteins with weak constraints, because a stringent negative selection pressure limits the number of substitutions. In contrast, Graur claimed that the substitution rate of a protein is mainly determined by its amino acid composition and the changeabilities of amino acids. In this paper, however, we found that the relative changeabilities of amino acids in mammalian proteins are different for transmembranal and nontransmembranal segments, which have very distinct structural requirements. This indicates that the changeability of a given residue is influenced by the structural and functional context. We also reexamined the relationship between substitution rate and amino acid composition. Indeed, the two kinds of segments exhibit contrasting amino acid compositions: transmembranal regions are made up mainly of hydrophobic residues (a total frequency of ~60%) and are very poor in polar amino acids (<5%), whereas nontransmembranal segments have frequencies of 30% and 22%, respectively. Interestingly, we found that within a given integral membrane protein, nontransmembranal segments accumulate, on average, twice as many substitutions as transmembranal regions. However, regression analyses showed that the variability in amino acid frequencies among proteins cannot explain more than 30% of the variability in substitution rate for the transmembranal and nontransmembranal data sets. Furthermore, transmembranal and nontransmembranal segments evolving at the same rate in different proteins have different compositions, and the compositions of slowly evolving and rapidly evolving segments of the same type are similar. From these observations, we conclude that the rate of protein evolution is only weakly affected by amino acid composition but is mostly determined by the strength of functional requirements or selective constraints.

N2  - Occurrence of an AATA interrupt in the IGF-I microsatellite was investigated in a number of Artiodactyl species, namely pigs, camels, deer, cattle, goats, and sheep. Comparison of DNA sequences in the 5' flank of the microsatellite in these species revealed that the interrupt within the microsatellite is conserved in deer, cattle, sheep, and goats but is absent from camels and pigs. The interrupt was introduced into the Artiodactyl phylogeny after the divergence of the Camelidae but before the divergence of the Cervidae, and thus its time of origin can be estimated to be 19-35 MYA. In contrast to the repeat units which are hypermutable, the interrupt has been conserved for a very long time and may even have suppressed microsatellite variation by inhibiting replication slippage. A 12-bp deletion in the 5' flank of the microsatellite in camels corresponds to a consensus reversed repeat in deer, cattle, sheep, and goats with unknown functional significance. Apart from this deletion, the 5' flank of the microsatellite is highly conserved in Artiodactyl species.

N2  - Modification of any one of three transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) genes, old-1, old-2 (formerly tkr-1 and tkr-2, respectively), and daf-2 can extend the mean and maximum life span of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To identify paralogs and orthologs, we delineated relationships between these three PTKs and all known transmembrane PTKs and all known mammalian nontransmembrane PTKs using molecular phylogenetics. The tree includes a number of invertebrate receptor PTKs and a novel mammalian receptor PTK (inferred from the expressed-sequence tag database) that have not previously been analyzed. old-1 and old-2 were found to be members of a surprisingly large C. elegans PTK family having 16 members. Interestingly, only four members of this transmembrane family appeared to have receptor domains (immunoglobulin-like in each case). The C-terminal domain of this family was found to have a unique sequence motif that could be important for downstream signaling. Among mammalian PTKs, the old-1/old-2 family appeared to be most closely related to the Pdgfr, Fgfr, Ret, and Tie/Tek families. However, these families appeared to have split too early from the old-1/old-2 family to be orthologs, suggesting that a mammalian ortholog could yet be discovered. An extensive search of the expressed-sequence tag database suggested no additional candidate orthologs. In contrast to old-1 and old-2, daf-2 had no C. elegans paralogs. Although daf-2 was most closely related to the mammalian insulin receptor family, a hydra insulin receptor-like sequence suggested that daf-2 might not be an ortholog of the insulin receptor family. Among PTKs, the old-1/old-2 family and daf-2 were not particularly closely related, raising the possibility that other PTK families might extend life span. On a more general note, our survey of the expressed-sequence tag database suggested that few, if any, additional mammalian PTK families are likely to be discovered. The one novel family that was discovered could represent a novel oncogene family, given the prevalence of oncogenes among PTKs. Finally, the PTK tree was consistent with nematodes and fruit flies being as divergent as nematodes and mammals, suggesting that life extension mechanisms shared by nematodes and fruit flies would be reasonable candidates for extending mammalian life spans.

N2  - The sequence evolution of the nuclear gene wingless was investigated among 34 representatives of three lepidopteran families (Riodinidae, Lycaenidae, and Nymphalidae) and four outgroups, and its utility for inferring phylogenetic relationships among these taxa was assessed. Parsimony analysis yielded a well-resolved topology supporting the monophyly of the Riodinidae and Lycaenidae, respectively, and indicating that these two groups are sister lineages, with strong nodal support based on bootstrap and decay indices. Although wingless provides robust support for relationships within and between the riodinids and the lycaenids, it is less informative about nymphalid relationships. Wingless does not consistently recover nymphalid monophyly or traditional subfamilial relationships within the nymphalids, and nodal support for all but the most recent branches in this family is low. Much of the phylogenetic information in this data set is derived from first- and second-position substitutions. However, third positions, despite showing uncorrected pairwise divergences up to 78%, also contain consistent signal at deep nodes within the family Riodinidae and at the node defining the sister relationship between the riodinids and lycaenids. Several hypotheses about how third-position signal has been retained in deep nodes are discussed. These include among-site rate variation, identified as a significant factor by maximum likelihood analyses, and nucleotide bias, a prominent feature of third positions in this data set. Understanding the mechanisms which underlie third-position signal is a first step in applying appropriate models to accommodate the specific evolutionary processes involved in each lineage.

N2  - Here we report the peculiarities of molecular evolution and divergence of paralogous heterochromatic clusters of the testis- expressed X-linked Stellate and Y-linked Su(Ste) tandem repeats. It was suggested that Stellate and Su(Ste) clusters affecting male fertility are the amplified derivatives of the unique euchromatic gene βCK2tes encoding the putative testis-specific β-subunit of protein kinase CK2. The putative Su(Ste)-like evolutionary intermediate was detected on the Y chromosome as an orphon outside of the Su(Ste) cluster. The orphon shows extensive homology to the Su(Ste) repeat, but contains several Stellate-like diagnostic nucleotide substitutions, as well as a 10-bp insertion and a 3' splice site of the first intron typical of the Stellate unit. The orphon looks like a pseudogene carrying a drastically damaged Su(Ste) open reading frame (ORF). The putative Su(Ste) ORF, as compared with the Stellate one, carries numerous synonymous substitutions leading to the major codon preference. We conclude that Su(Ste) ORFs evolved on the Y chromosome under the pressure of translational selection. Direct sequencing shows that the efficiency of concerted evolution between adjacent repeats is 5-10 times as high in the Stellate heterochromatic cluster on the X chromosome as that in the Y-linked Su(Ste) cluster, judging by the frequencies of nucleotide substitutions and single-nucleotide deletions.

N2  - In organisms with chromosomal sex determination, sex is determined by a set of dimorphic sex chromosomes that are thought to have evolved from a set of originally homologous chromosomes. The chromosome inherited only through the heterogametic sex (the Y chromosome in the case of male heterogamety) often exhibits loss of genetic activity for most of the genes carried on its homolog and is hence referred to as degenerate. The process by which the proto-Y chromosome loses its genetic activity has long been the subject of much speculation. We present a DNA sequence variation analysis of marker genes on the evolving sex chromosomes (neo-sex chromosomes) of Drosophila miranda. Due to its relatively recent origin, the neo-Y chromosome of this species is presumed to be still experiencing the forces responsible for the loss of its genetic activity. Indeed, several previous studies have confirmed the presence of some active loci on this chromosome. The genes on the neo-Y chromosome surveyed in the current study show generally lower levels of variation compared with their counterparts on the neo-X chromosome or an X-linked gene. This is in accord with a reduced effective population size of the neo-Y chromosome. Interestingly, the rate of replacement nucleotide substitutions for the neo-Y linked genes is significantly higher than that for the neo-X linked genes. This is not expected under a model where the faster evolution of the X chromosome is postulated to be the main force driving the degeneration of the Y chromosome.

N2  - The three anomalously pigmented dinoflagellates Gymnodinium galatheanum, Gyrodinium aureolum, and Gymnodinium breve have plastids possessing 19'-hexanoyloxy-fucoxanthin as the major carotenoid rather than peridinin, which is characteristic of the majority of the dinoflagellates. Analyses of SSU rDNA from the plastid and the nuclear genome of these dinoflagellate species indicate that they have acquired their plastids via endosymbiosis of a haptophyte. The dinoflagellate plastid sequences appear to have undergone rapid sequence evolution, and there is considerable divergence between the three species. However, distance, parsimony, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses of plastid SSU rRNA gene sequences place the three species within the haptophyte clade. Pavlova gyrans is the most basal branching haptophyte and is the outgroup to a clade comprising the dinoflagellate sequences and those of other haptophytes. The haptophytes themselves are thought to have plastids of a secondary origin; hence, these dinoflagellates appear to have tertiary plastids. Both molecular and morphological data divide the plastids into two groups, where G. aureolum and G. breve have similar plastid morphology and G. galatheanum has plastids with distinctive features.

N2  - Sequence similarities exist between terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) of some miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) families isolated from a wide range of organisms, including plants, insects, and humans, and TIRs of DNA transposons from the pogo family. We present here evidence that one of these MITE families, previously described for Arabidopsis thaliana, is derived from a larger element encoding a putative transposase. We have named this novel class II transposon Lemi1. We show that its putative product is related to transposases of the Tc1/mariner superfamily, being closer to the pogo family. A similar truncated element was found in a tomato DNA sequence, indicating an ancient origin and/or horizontal transfer for this family of elements. These results are reminiscent of those recently reported for the human genome, where other members of the pogo family, named Tiggers, are believed to be responsible for the generation of abundant MITE-like elements in an early primate ancestor. These results further suggest that some MITE families, which are highly reiterated in plant, insect, and human genomes, could have arisen from a similar mechanism, implicating pogo-like elements.

N2  - The mammalian 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetases (2'-5'OASs) are enzymes that are crucial in the interferon-induced antiviral response. They catalyze the polymerization of ATP into 2'-5'-linked oligoadenylates which activate a constitutively expressed latent endonuclease, RNaseL, to block viral replication at the level of mRNA degradation. A molecular evolutionary analysis of available OAS sequences suggests that the vertebrate genes are members of a multigene family with its roots in the early history of tetrapods. The modern mammalian 2'-5'OAS genes underwent successive gene duplication events resulting in three size classes of enzymes, containing one, two, or three homologous domains. Expansion of the OAS gene family occurred by whole-gene duplications to increase gene content and by domain couplings to produce the multidomain genes. Evolutionary analyses show that the 2'-5'OAS genes in rodents underwent gene duplications as recently as 11 MYA and predict the existence of additional undiscovered OAS genes in mammals.

N2  - Twenty-four new insertions were obtained from seven different locations in the nuclear 18S rDNA for seven species of the lichen-forming fungal genus Physconia. They were analyzed allowing for terminal sequence conservation by adopting a flexible approach to exact insertion site position, and they were compared with 12 previously reported small insertion sequences from the 18S ribosomal RNA gene. Such insertions have previously been proposed to be degenerate self-splicing group I introns; however, the methodology used here identified consensus terminal sequences characteristic of spliceosomal introns. This finding is the first suggestion that multiple spliceosomal introns occur in ribosomal genes.

N2  - Polymorphisms at di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide microsatellite loci have been analyzed in 14 worldwide populations. A statistical index of population expansion, denoted Sk, is introduced to detect historical changes in population size using the variation at the microsatellites. The index takes the value 0 at equilibrium with constant population size and is positive or negative according to whether the population is expanding or contracting, respectively. The use of Sk requires estimation of properties of the mutation distribution for which we use both family data of Dib et al. for dinucleotide loci and our population data on tri- and tetranucleotide loci. Statistical estimates of the expansion index, as well as their confidence intervals from bootstrap resampling, are provided. In addition, a dynamical analysis of Sk is presented under various assumptions on population growth or decline. The studied populations are classified as having high, intermediate, or low values of Sk and genetic variation, and we use these to interpret the data in terms of possible population dynamics. Observed values of Sk for samples of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide data are compatible with population expansion earlier than 60,000 years ago in Africa, Asia, and Europe if the initial population size before the expansion was on the order of 500. Larger initial population sizes force the lower bound for the time since expansion to be much earlier. We find it unlikely that bottlenecks occurred in Central African, East Asian, or European populations, and the estimated expansion times are rather similar for all of these populations. This analysis presented here suggests that modern human populations departed from Africa long before they began to expand in size. Subsequently, the major groups (the African, East Asian, and European groups) started to grow at approximately same time. Populations of South America and Oceania show almost no growth. The Mbuti population from Zaire appears to have experienced a bottleneck during its expansion.

N2  - In this study, the evolutionary history of the variable second exon of RT1.Ba and its adjoining intron b are compared across a number of species and subspecies of the Australian Rattus. Three lineages are identified in the second intron across a range of Rattus species. Two of these lineages, separated by the insertion of a probable rodent short interspersed nucleotide element and by point mutations outside the indel region, are both found in each of the major clades of the endemic Australian Rattus. This pattern of ancestral polymorphism is reflected in the adjoining exon 2 sequences, although phylogenetic constraints confirm that the clustering is not identical to that of the associated intron sequences. In addition, the coding sequences show evidence of the retention of ancestral polymorphism, with identical exon sequences found in two divergent species, and some indication of gene conversion detected for the exon sequences.

N2  - In Pinaceae, the chloroplast, mitochondrial, and nuclear genomes are paternally, maternally, and biparentally inherited, respectively. Examining congruence and incongruence of gene phylogenies among the three genomes should provide insights into phylogenetic relationships within the family. Here we studied intergeneric relationships of Pinaceae using sequences of the chloroplast matK gene, the mitochondrial nad5 gene, and the low-copy nuclear gene 4CL. The 4CL gene may exist as a single copy in some species of Pinaceae, but it constitutes a small gene family with two or three members in others. Duplication and deletion of the 4CL gene occurred at a tempo such that paralogous loci are maintained within but not between genera. Exons of the 4CL gene have diverged approximately twice as fast as the matK gene and five times more rapidly than the nad5 gene. The partition-homogeneity test indicates that the three data sets are homogeneous. A combined analysis of the three gene sequences generated a well-resolved and strongly supported phylogeny. The combined phylogeny, which is topologically congruent with the three individual gene trees based on the Templeton test, is likely to represent the organismal phylogeny of Pinaceae. This phylogeny agrees to a certain extent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphological, anatomical, and immunological data. Disagreement between the previous hypotheses and the three-genome phylogeny suggests that morphology of both vegetative and reproductive organs has undergone convergent evolution within the pine family. The strongly supported monophyly of Nothotsuga longibracteata, Tsuga mertensiana, and Tsuga canadensis on all three gene phylogenies provides evidence against previous hypotheses of intergeneric hybrid origins of N. longibracteata and T. mertensiana. Divergence times of the genera were estimated based on sequence divergence of the matK gene, and they correspond well with the fossil record.

N2  - Sequences of two chloroplast photosystem genes, psaA and psbB, together comprising about 3,500 bp, were obtained for all five major groups of extant seed plants and several outgroups among other vascular plants. Strongly supported, but significantly conflicting, phylogenetic signals were obtained in parsimony analyses from partitions of the data into first and second codon positions versus third positions. In the former, both genes agreed on a monophyletic gymnosperms, with Gnetales closely related to certain conifers. In the latter, Gnetales are inferred to be the sister group of all other seed plants, with gymnosperms paraphyletic. None of the data supported the modern "anthophyte hypothesis," which places Gnetales as the sister group of flowering plants. A series of simulation studies were undertaken to examine the error rate for parsimony inference. Three kinds of errors were examined: random error, systematic bias (both properties of finite data sets), and statistical inconsistency owing to long-branch attraction (an asymptotic property). Parsimony reconstructions were extremely biased for third-position data for psbB. Regardless of the true underlying tree, a tree in which Gnetales are sister to all other seed plants was likely to be reconstructed for these data. None of the combinations of genes or partitions permits the anthophyte tree to be reconstructed with high probability. Simulations of progressively larger data sets indicate the existence of long-branch attraction (statistical inconsistency) for third-position psbB data if either the anthophyte tree or the gymnosperm tree is correct. This is also true for the anthophyte tree using either psaA third positions or psbB first and second positions. A factor contributing to bias and inconsistency is extremely short branches at the base of the seed plant radiation, coupled with extremely high rates in Gnetales and nonseed plant outgroups.

N2  - We show how to make appropriate likelihood ratio tests for evolutionary tree models when parameters such as edge (internodes or branches) lengths have nonnegativity constraints. In such cases, under the null model of an edge length being zero, the marginal distribution of this parameter is proven to be a "half-normal", that is, 50% zero values and 50% the positive half of a normal distribution. Other constrained parameters, such as the proportion of invariant sites, give similar results. To make likelihood ratio tests between nested models, e.g., H0: homogeneous site rates, and H1: site rates follow a gamma distribution with variance 1/k, then asymptotically as sequence length increases, the distribution under H0 becomes a mixture of χ distributions, in this case 50% χ0, and 50% χ1 (where the subscript denotes degrees of freedom, i.e., not the usually assumed 100% χ1; which leads to a conservative test). Such mixtures are sometimes called distributions. Simulations show that even with sequences as short as 125 sites, some parameters, including the proportion of invariant sites, fit asymptotic distributions closely.

N2  - We sequenced the genomic region containing the human Y-linked zinc finger gene (ZFY). Comparison of ZFY to the related region on the X chromosome (ZFX) and to autosomal sequences reveals a significant accumulation of transposable elements on the sex chromosomes. In addition, five times as many retroviruslike elements (RLEs) are present in the ZFY region as in the ZFX region. Thus, transposable elements accumulate more rapidly on the sex chromosomes, and the insertion of RLEs may occur more frequently in the male than in the female germ line. When the accumulation of substitutions in Alu elements was analyzed, it was found that the Alu elements at the Y-chromosomal locus diverged significantly faster than those at the X-chromosomal locus, whereas the divergence of autosomal Alu elements was intermediate. The male-to-female mutation rate ratio was estimated to be 2.5.

N2  - We determined the complete 14,985-nt sequence of the mitochondrial DNA of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus (Arthropoda: Xiphosura). This mtDNA encodes the 13 protein, 2 rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes typical for metazoans. The arrangement of these genes and about half of the sequence was reported previously; however, the sequence contained a large number of errors, which are corrected here. The two strands of Limulus mtDNA have significantly different nucleotide compositions. The strand encoding most mitochondrial proteins has 1.25 times as many A's as T's and 2.33 times as many C's as G's. This nucleotide bias correlates with the biases in amino acid content and synonymous codon usage in proteins encoded by different strands and with the number of non-Watson-Crick base pairs in the stem regions of encoded tRNAs. The sizes of most mitochondrial protein genes in Limulus are either identical to or slightly smaller than those of their Drosophila counterparts. The usage of the initiation and termination codons in these genes seems to follow patterns that are conserved among most arthropod and some other metazoan mitochondrial genomes. The noncoding region of Limulus mtDNA contains a potential stem-loop structure, and we found a similar structure in the noncoding region of the published mtDNA of the prostriate tick Ixodes hexagonus. A simulation study was designed to evaluate the significance of these secondary structures; it revealed that they are statistically significant. No significant, comparable structure can be identified for the metastriate ticks Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Boophilus microplus. The latter two animals also share a mitochondrial gene rearrangement and an unusual structure of mt-tRNA(C) that is exactly the same association of changes as previously reported for a group of lizards. This suggests that the changes observed are not independent and that the stem-loop structure found in the noncoding regions of Limulus and Ixodes mtDNA may play the same role as that between trnN and trnC in vertebrates, i.e., the role of lagging strand origin of replication.

N2  - Methods such as maximum parsimony (MP) are frequently criticized as being statistically unsound and not being based on any "model." On the other hand, advocates of MP claim that maximum likelihood (ML) has some fundamental problems. Here, we explore the connection between the different versions of MP and ML methods, particularly in light of recent theoretical results. We describe links between the two methods--for example, we describe how MP can be regarded as an ML method when there is no common mechanism between sites (such as might occur with morphological data and certain forms of molecular data). In the process, we clarify certain historical points of disagreement between proponents of the two methodologies, including a discussion of several forms of the ML optimality criterion. We also describe some additional results that shed light on how much needs to be assumed about underling models of sequence evolution in order to successfully reconstruct evolutionary trees.

N2  - This study was conducted to test the effects of internal (genetic) and external factors on allelic diversity at 27 dinucleotide microsatellite (simple sequence repeat [SSR]) loci in three Israeli natural populations of Triticum dicoccoides from Ammiad, Tabigha, and Yehudiyya, north of the Sea of Galilee. The results demonstrated that SSR diversity is correlated with the interaction of ecological and genetic factors. Genetic factors, including genome (A vs. B), chromosome, motif, and locus, affected average repeat number (ARN), variance in repeat number (σ), and number of alleles (NA) of SSRs, but the significance of some factors varied among populations. Genome effect on SSR variation may result from different motif types, particularly compound (or imperfect) versus perfect motifs, which may be related to different evolutionary histories of genomes A and B. Ecological factors significantly affected SSR variation. Soil-unique and soil-specific alleles were found in two edaphic groups dwelling on terra rossa and basalt soils across macro- and microgeographical scales. The largest contributions of genetic and ecological effects were found for diversity of ARN and NA, respectively. Multiple regression indicated that replication slippage and unequal crossing over could be important mutational mechanisms, but their significance varied among motifs. Edaphic stresses may affect the probability of replication errors and recombination intermediates and thus control diversity level and divergence of SSRs. The results may indicate that SSR diversity is adaptive, channeled by natural selection and influenced by both internal and external factors and their interactions.

N2  - The complete sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the giant tiger prawn, Penaeus monodon (Arthropoda, Crustacea, Malacostraca), is presented. The gene content and gene order are identical to those observed in Drosophila yakuba. The overall AT composition is lower than that observed in the known insect mitochondrial genomes, but higher than that observed in the other two crustaceans for which complete mitochondrial sequence is available. Analysis of the effect of nucleotide bias on codon composition across the Arthropoda reveals a trend with the crustaceans represented showing the lowest proportion of AT-rich codons in mitochondrial protein genes. Phylogenetic analysis among arthropods using concatenated protein-coding sequences provides further support for the possibility that Crustacea are paraphyletic. Furthermore, in contrast to data from the nuclear gene EF1α, the first complete sequence of a malacostracan mitochondrial genome supports the possibility that Malacostraca are more closely related to Insecta than to Branchiopoda.

N2  - A method for computing the likelihood of a set of sequences assuming a phylogenetic network as an evolutionary hypothesis is presented. The approach applies directed graphical models to sequence evolution on networks and is a natural generalization of earlier work by Felsenstein on evolutionary trees, including it as a special case. The likelihood computation involves several steps. First, the phylogenetic network is rooted to form a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Then, applying standard models for nucleotide/amino acid substitution, the DAG is converted into a Bayesian network from which the joint probability distribution involving all nodes of the network can be directly read. The joint probability is explicitly dependent on branch lengths and on recombination parameters (prior probability of a parent sequence). The likelihood of the data assuming no knowledge of hidden nodes is obtained by marginalization, i.e., by summing over all combinations of unknown states. As the number of terms increases exponentially with the number of hidden nodes, a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure (Gibbs sampling) is used to accurately approximate the likelihood by summing over the most important states only. Investigating a human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) data set and optimizing both branch lengths and recombination parameters, we find that the likelihood of a corresponding phylogenetic network outperforms a set of competing evolutionary trees. In general, except for the case of a tree, the likelihood of a network will be dependent on the choice of the root, even if a reversible model of substitution is applied. Thus, the method also provides a way in which to root a phylogenetic network by choosing a node that produces a most likely network.

N2  - Accurate translation termination is essential for cell viability. In eukaryotes, this process is strictly maintained by two proteins, eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1), which recognizes all stop codons and hydrolyzes peptidyl-tRNA, and eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3), which is an elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) homolog stimulating eRF1 activity. To retrace the evolution of this core system, we cloned and sequenced the eRF3 genes from Trichomonas vaginalis (Parabasalia) and Giardia lamblia (Diplomonada), which are generally thought to be "early-diverging eukaryotes," as well as those from two ciliates (Oxytricha trifallax and Euplotes aediculatus). We also determined the sequence of the eRF1 gene for G. lamblia. Surprisingly, the G. lamblia eRF3 appears to have only one domain, corresponding to EF-1α, while other eRF3s (including the T. vaginalis protein) have an additional N-terminal domain, of 66-411 amino acids. Considering this novel eRF3 structure and our extensive phylogenetic analyses, we suggest that (1) the current translation termination system in eukaryotes evolved from the archaea-like version, (2) eRF3 was introduced into the system prior to the divergence of extant eukaryotes, including G. lamblia, and (3) G. lamblia might be the first eukaryotic branch among the organisms considered.

To date, exhaustive algorithms that find the most likely set of ancestral states (joint reconstruction) have running times that scale exponentially with the number of sequences and are thus limited to very few taxa. The time requirement of our new algorithm scales linearly with the number of sequences and is therefore applicable to practically any number of taxa. A detailed description of the new algorithm and an example of its application to cytochrome b sequences are provided.

N2  - The usual assumption that species have evolved from a common ancestor by a simple branching process--where each branch is genetically isolated--has been challenged by the observation of frequent hybridization between species in natural populations. In fact, most plant species are thought to have hybrid origins. This reticulate pattern of species evolution has posed problems in the definition of speciation and in phylogenetic reconstruction, especially when molecular data are used. As a result, hybridization has been largely treated as an evolutionary accident or statistical error in phylogenetic analysis. In this paper, I explicitly incorporate hybridization as an evolutionary occurrence and then conduct phylogenetic reconstruction. I first examine the reticulate evolution under a pure drift model, and then extend the theory to fit a mutation model. A least-squares method is developed for reconstructing a reticulate phylogeny using gene frequency data. The efficacy of the method under the pure drift model is verified via Monte Carlo simulations.

A 362-bp fragment from the integrase gene (int) was amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Phylogenetic relationships of the elements isolated from independent clones were compared with the host phylogeny. Our results indicate that two main lineages of Gypsy exist in the melanogaster subgroup and that vertical and horizontal transmission have played a crucial role in the evolution of this insect endogenous retrovirus.

N2  - L1 (LINE-1) elements constitute a large family of mammalian retrotransposons that have been replicating and evolving in mammals for more than 100 Myr and now compose 20% or more of the DNA of some mammals. Here, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of the active human Ta L1 family and found that it arose ~4 MYA and subsequently differentiated into two major subfamilies, Ta-0 and Ta-1, each of which contain additional subsets. Ta-1, which has not heretofore been described, is younger than Ta-0 and now accounts for at least 50% of the Ta family. Although Ta-0 contains some active elements, the Ta-1 subfamily has replaced it as the replicatively dominant subfamily in humans; 69% of the loci that contain Ta-1 inserts are polymorphic for the presence or absence of the insert in human populations, as compared with 29% of the loci that contain Ta-0 inserts. This value is 90% for loci that contain Ta-1d inserts, which are the youngest subset of Ta-1 and now account for about two thirds of the Ta-1 subfamily. The successive emergence and amplification of distinct Ta L1 subfamilies shows that L1 evolution has been as active in recent human history as it has been found to be for rodent L1 families. In addition, Ta-1 elements have been accumulating in humans at about the same rate per generation as recently evolved active rodent L1 subfamilies.

N2  - Rates of mutation and substitution in mammals are generally greater in the germ lines of males. This is usually explained as resulting from the larger number of germ cell divisions during spermatogenesis compared with oogenesis, with the assumption made that mutations occur primarily during DNA replication. However, the rate of cell division is not the only difference between male and female germ lines, and mechanisms are known that can give rise to mutations independently of DNA replication. We investigate the possibility that there are other causes of male-biased mutation. First, we show that patterns of variation at ~5,200 short tandem repeat (STR) loci indicate a higher mutation rate in males. We estimate a ratio of male-to-female mutation rates of ~1.9. This is significantly greater than 1 and supports a greater rate of mutation in males, affecting the evolution of these loci. Second, we show that there are chromosome-specific patterns of nucleotide and dinucleotide composition in mammals that have been shaped by mutation at CpG dinucleotides. Comparable patterns occur in birds. In mammals, male germ lines are more methylated than female germ lines, and these patterns indicate that differential methylation has played a role in male-biased vertebrate evolution. However, estimates of male mutation bias obtained from both classes of mutation are substantially lower than estimates of cell division bias from anatomical data. This discrepancy, along with published data indicating slipped-strand mispairing arising at STR loci in nonreplicating DNA, suggests that a substantial percentage of mutation may occur in nonreplicating DNA.

N2  - Two recent studies have presented conflicting views on variation present within the 294 base third domain of the 12S rRNA gene in the genus Drosophila, and in D. pseudoobscura in particular. One study suggested that this gene is highly invariant across the genus, while another recovered 22 distinct haplotypes from 22 strains of D. pseudoobscura. We have sequenced this gene in numerous lines of D. pseudoobscura and its relatives, noting only two haplotypes in the third domain, and we failed to confirm any of the published sequences. Second, we note that the published sequence divergence between strains of D. pseudoobscura was as great as that documented between distantly related Drosophila species. Third, we show that the published polymorphisms of this region within D. pseudoobscura would disrupt the secondary structure of the resulting molecule. We conclude that the published 12S rRNA sequences of D. pseudoobscura do not accurately reflect variability of the functional gene, and that this gene is relatively invariant in D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis.

N2  - High temperature inhibits the growth of the wild-type bacteriophage ϕX174. Three different point mutations were identified that each recovered growth at high temperature. Two affected the major capsid protein (residues F188 and F242), and one affected the internal scaffolding protein (B114). One of the major capsid mutations (F242) is located in a β strand that contacts B114 in the procapsid during viral maturation, whereas the other capsid mutation (F188) is involved in subunit interactions at the threefold axis of symmetry. Selective coefficients of these mutations ranged from 13.9 to 3.8 in the inhibitory, hot environment, but all mutations reduced fitness at normal temperature. The selective effect of one of the mutations (F242) was evaluated at high temperature in four different genetic backgrounds and exhibited epistasis of diminishing returns: as log fitness of the background genotype increased from -0.1 to 4.1, the fitness boost provided by the F242 mutation decreased from 3.9 to 0.8. These results support a model in which viral fitness is bounded by an upper limit and the benefit of a mutation is scaled according to the remaining opportunity for fitness improvement in the genome.

N2  - A very small fraction of the proteins required for the propagation and function of mitochondria are coded by their genomes, while nuclear genes code the vast majority. We studied the migration of genes between the two genomes when transfer mechanisms mediate this exchange. We could calculate the influence of differential mutation rates, as well as that of biased transfer rates, on the partitioning of genes between the two genomes. We observe no significant difference in partitioning for haploid and diploid cell populations, but the effective size of cell populations is important. For infinitely large effective populations, higher mutation rates in mitochondria than in nuclear genomes are required to drive mitochondrial genes to the nuclear genome. In the more realistic case of finite populations, gene transfer favoring the nucleus and/or higher mutation rates in the mitochondrion will drive mitochondrial genes to the nucleus. We summarize experimental data that identify a gene transfer process mediated by vacuoles that favors the accumulation of mitochondrial genes in the nuclei of modern cells. Finally, we compare the behavior of mitochondrial genes for which transfer to the nucleus is neutral or influenced by purifying selection.

N2  - Separating the confounding effects of long-term population history from gene flow can be difficult. Here, we address the question of what inferences about gene flow can be made from mitochondrial sequence data in three closely related species of mosquitoes, Anopheles dirus species A, C, and D, from southeast Asia. A total of 84 sequences of 923 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I gene were obtained from 14 populations in Thailand, Myanmar, and Bangladesh. The genealogy of sequences obtained from two populations of An. dirus C indicates no contemporary gene flow between them. The FST value of 0.421 therefore probably represents a recent common history, perhaps involving colonization events. Anopheles dirus A and D are parapatric, yet no differentiation was seen either within or between species. The starlike genealogy of their haplotypes, smooth unimodal mismatch distributions, and excess of low frequency mutations indicate population expansion in An. dirus A and D. This, rather than widespread gene flow, explains their low within-species FST values (0.018 and 0.022). The greater genetic diversity of An. dirus D suggests that expansion occurred first in species D and subsequently in species A. The current geographical separation and low hybrid fitness of these species also argue against ongoing interspecific gene flow. They suggest instead either historical introgression of mtDNA from An. dirus D into species A followed by independent range expansions, or a selective sweep of mtDNA that originated in An. dirus D. While not excluding contemporary gene flow, historical population processes are sufficient to explain the data in An. dirus A and D. The genealogical relationships between haplotypes could not be used to make inferences of gene flow because of extensive homoplasy due to hypervariable sites and possibly also recombination. However, it is concluded that this approach, rather than the use of fixation indices, is required in the future to understand contemporary gene flow in these mosquitoes. The implications of these results for understanding gene flow in another important and comparable group of malaria vector mosquitoes in Africa, the An. gambiae complex, are also discussed.

N2  - Genomic or cDNA clones for the glycolytic enzyme enolase were isolated from the amitochondriate pelobiont Mastigamoeba balamuthi, from the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei, and from the euglenid Euglena gracilis. Clones for the cytosolic enzyme were found in all three organisms, whereas Euglena was found to also express mRNA for a second isoenzyme that possesses a putative N-terminal plastid-targeting peptide and is probably targeted to the chloroplast. Database searching revealed that Arabidopsis also possesses a second enolase gene that encodes an N-terminal extension and is likely targeted to the chloroplast. A phylogeny of enolase amino acid sequences from 6 archaebacteria, 24 eubacteria, and 32 eukaryotes showed that the Mastigamoeba enolase tended to branch with its homologs from Trypanosoma and from the amitochondriate protist Entamoeba histolytica. The compartment-specific isoenzymes in Euglena arose through a gene duplication independent of that which gave rise to the compartment-specific isoenzymes in Arabidopsis, as evidenced by the finding that the Euglena enolases are more similar to the homolog from the eubacterium Treponema pallidum than they are to homologs from any other organism sampled. In marked contrast to all other glycolytic enzymes studied to date, enolases from all eukaryotes surveyed here (except Euglena) are not markedly more similar to eubacterial than to archaebacterial homologs. An intriguing indel shared by enolase from eukaryotes, from the archaebacterium Methanococcus jannaschii, and from the eubacterium Campylobacter jejuni maps to the surface of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme and appears to have occurred at the same position in parallel in independent lineages.

N2  - Microsatellites are tandem repetitions of short (1-6 bp) motifs. It is widely assumed that microsatellites degenerate through the accumulation of base substitutions in the repeat array. Using a phylogenetic framework, we studied the evolutionary dynamics of interruptions in three Drosophila microsatellite loci. For all three loci, we show that the interruptions in a microsatellite can be lost, resulting in a longer uninterrupted microsatellite stretch. These results indicate that mutations in the microsatellite array do not necessarily lead to decay but may represent only a transition state during the evolution of a microsatellite. Most likely, this purification of interrupted microsatellites is caused by DNA replication slippage.

N2  - Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) catalyzing the hydrolysis of phospholipids form a family of proteins with diverse physiological and pharmacological properties. While there have been several reports on the cloning of PLA2 cDNAs, very few studies have been carried out on the PLA2 genes and, most importantly, no information has been available on the gene structure and function of group I venom PLA2. This study, on the PLA2 gene from a spitting cobra, besides being the very first report on any venom group I PLA2 gene, constitutes the missing link in the biology and evolution of phospholipases. The 4-kb gene consists of four exons and three introns and resembles the human pancreatic PLA2 gene. However, the size of intron 3 in particular is much smaller than that in the pancreatic gene. Interestingly, the information for the toxic and most of the pharmacological properties of the venom PLA2 can be attributed to the end of exon 3 and the whole of exon 4 of the gene. This functional delineation fits in well with the theory of adaptive evolution exhibited by the venom PLA2s. We also show that the mammalian pancreatic and elapid PLA2s have similar paths of evolution (probably following gene duplication) from a common ancestral gene. Venom group II phospholipases, although evolved from the same ancestor, diverged early in evolution from the group I PLA2 genes. Intriguingly, CAT reporter gene assays and DNase 1 footprinting studies on the promoter and its deletion constructs using CHO and HepG2 cell lines identified the possible involvement of cis elements such as Sp1, AP2, γ-IRE, and (TG)12 repeats in the expression of the gene in a tissue-specific manner.

N2  - The existence of a lineage-specific nucleotide substitution rate in mammalian mtDNA has been investigated by analyzing the mtDNA of all available species, that is, 35 complete mitochondrial genomes from 14 mammalian orders. A detailed study of their evolutionary dynamics has been carried out on both ribosomal RNA and first and second codon positions (P12) of H-strand protein-coding genes by using two different types of relative-rate tests. Results are quite congruent between ribosomal and P12 sites. Significant rate variations have been observed among orders and among species of the same order. However, rate variation does not exceed 1.8-fold between the fastest (Proboscidea and Primates) and the slowest (Perissodactyla) evolving orders. Thus, the observed mitochondrial rate variations among taxa do not invalidate the suitability of mtDNA for drawing mammalian phylogeny. Dependence of evolutionary rate differences on variations in mutation and/or fixation rates was examined. Body size, generation time, and metabolic rate were tested, and no significant correlation was observed between them and the taxon-specific evolutionary rates, most likely because the latter might be influenced by multiple overlapping variable constraints.

N2  - The phylogenetic position of the Acoela is a key problem in the understanding of metazoan evolution. Recent studies based on 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences have placed the Acoela in an extremely basal position as the sister group to all other extant triploblastic animals, suggesting that the phylum Platyhelminthes is polyphyletic. In order to test the results obtained with 18S rDNA, we sequenced elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1a) for the acoel Convoluta roscoffensis and five species of Turbellaria (two polyclads, Leptoplana tremellaris, and Prostheceraeus vittatus, and three triclads, Crenobia alpina, Schmidtea polychroa, and Girardia tigrina). Phylogenetic analyses of EF1a sequences show that the acoel sequences branch within the Platyhelminthes, in opposition to the 18S rDNA data. Moreover, comparison of the central variable region of EF1a shows similar sequence signatures between C. roscoffensis and the three triclad species. Although EF1a sequences fail to prove the monophyly of the phylum Platyhelminthes, they do not confirm the early divergence of the Acoela.

N2  - We performed a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the Ty3/Gypsy group of long-terminal-repeat retrotransposons (also known as Metaviridae). Exhaustive database searches allowed us to detect novel elements of this group. In particular, the Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster genome sequencing projects have recently disclosed a large number of new Ty3/Gypsy sequences. So far, elements of three different Ty3/Gypsy lineages had been described for A. thaliana. Here, we describe six new lineages, which we have called Tit-for-tat1, Tit-for-tat2, Gimli, Gloin, Legolas, and Little Athila. We confirm that plant Ty3/Gypsy elements form two main monophyletic groups. Moreover, our results suggest that at least four independent ancestral lineages existed before the monocot-dicot split, about 200 MYA. Twelve sequences from D. melanogaster that may correspond to new elements are also described. Some of these sequences are similar to those of Osvaldo and Ulysses, two elements of the Osvaldo clade that had never before been described for D. melanogaster. Comparative analyses of multiple organisms, some of them with completely sequenced genomes, show that the number of lineages of Ty3/Gypsy elements is very variable. Thus, while only 1 lineage is present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, at least 6 exist in Caenorhabditis elegans, at least 9 are present in the A. thaliana, and perhaps 20 are present in D. melanogaster. Finally, we suggest that the presence of a chromodomain-containing integrase, a feature of some closely related Ty3/Gypsy elements of fungi, plants, and animals, may be used to define a new Metaviridae genus.

N2  - In order to explore the variety of possible responses available to a ribozyme population evolving a novel phenotype, five Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron ribozyme pools were evolved in parallel for cleavage of a DNA oligonucleotide. These ribozyme populations were propagated under identical conditions and characterized when they reached apparent phenotypic plateaus; the populations that reached the highest plateau showed a near 100-fold improvement in DNA cleavage activity. A detailed characterization of the evolved response in these populations reveals at least two distinct phenotypic trajectories emerging as a result of the imposed selection. Not only do these distinct solutions exhibit differential DNA cleavage activity, but they also exhibit a very different correlation with a related, but unselected, phenotype: RNA cleavage activity. In turn, each of these trajectories is underwritten by differing genotypic profiles. This study underscores the complex network of possible trajectories through sequence space available to an evolving population and uncovers the diversity of solutions that result when the process of experimental evolution is repeated multiple times in a simple, engineered system.

N2  - Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) function as central regulators of both the cell cycle and transcription. CDK activation depends on phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK). Different CAKs have been identified in budding yeast, fission yeast, and metazoans. All known CAKs belong to the extended CDK family. The sole budding yeast CAK, CAK1, and one of the two CAKs in fission yeast, csk1, have diverged considerably from other CDKs. Cell cycle regulatory components have been largely conserved in eukaryotes; however, orthologs of neither CAK1 nor csk1 have been identified in other species to date. To determine the evolutionary relationships of yeast and metazoan CAKs, we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the extended CDK family in budding yeast, fission yeast, humans, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We observed that there were 10 clades for CDK-related genes, of which seven appeared ancestral, containing both yeast and metazoan genes. The four clades that contain CDKs that regulate transcription by phosphorylating the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA Polymerase II generally have only a single orthologous gene in each species of yeast and metazoans. In contrast, the ancestral cell cycle CDK (analogous to budding yeast CDC28) gave rise to a number of genes in metazoans, as did the ancestor of budding yeast PHO85. One ancestral clade is unique in that there are fission yeast and metazoan members, but there is no budding yeast ortholog, suggesting that it was lost subsequent to evolutionary divergence. Interestingly, CAK1 and csk1 branch together with high bootstrap support values. We used both the relative apparent synapomorphy analysis (RASA) method in combination with the S-F method of sampling reduced character sets and gamma-corrected distance methods to confirm that the CAK1/csk1 association was not an artifact of long-branch attraction. This result suggests that CAK1 and csk1 are orthologs and that a central aspect of CAK regulation has been conserved in budding and fission yeast. Although there are metazoan CDK-family members for which we could not define ancestral lineage, our analysis failed to identify metazoan CAK1/csk1 orthologs, suggesting that if the CAK1/csk1 gene existed in the metazoan ancestor, it has not been conserved.

N2  - We report the presence of four nuclear paralogs of a 380-bp segment of cytochrome b in callitrichine primates (marmosets and tamarins). The mitochondrial cytochrome b sequence and each nuclear paralog were obtained from several species, allowing multiple comparisons of rates and patterns of substitution both between mitochondrial and nuclear sequences and among nuclear sequences. The mitochondrial DNA had high overall rates of molecular evolution and a strong bias toward substitutions at third codon positions. Rates of molecular evolution among the nuclear sequences were low and constant, and there were small differences in substitution patterns among the nuclear clades which were probably attributable to the small number of sites involved. A novel method of phylogenetic reconstruction based on the large difference in rates of evolution at different codon positions among mitochondrial and nuclear clades was used to determine whether different nuclear paralogs represent independent transposition events or duplications following a single insertion. This method is generally applicable in cases where differences in pattern of molecular evolution are known, and it showed that at least three of the four nuclear clades represent independent transposition events. The insertion events giving rise to two of the nuclear clades predate the divergence of the callitrichines, whereas those leading to the other two nuclear clades may have occurred in the common ancestor of marmosets.

N2  - Protein-coding genes of the mitochondrial genomes from 31 mammalian species were analyzed to estimate the speciation dates within primates and also between rats and mice. Three calibration points were used based on paleontological data: one at 20-25 MYA for the hominoid/cercopithecoid divergence, one at 53-57 MYA for the cetacean/artiodactyl divergence, and the third at 110-130 MYA for the metatherian/eutherian divergence. Both the nucleotide and the amino acid sequences were analyzed, producing conflicting results. The global molecular clock was clearly violated for both the nucleotide and the amino acid data. Models of local clocks were implemented using maximum likelihood, allowing different evolutionary rates for some lineages while assuming rate constancy in others. Surprisingly, the highly divergent third codon positions appeared to contain phylogenetic information and produced more sensible estimates of primate divergence dates than did the amino acid sequences. Estimated dates varied considerably depending on the data type, the calibration point, and the substitution model but differed little among the four tree topologies used. We conclude that the calibration derived from the primate fossil record is too recent to be reliable; we also point out a number of problems in date estimation when the molecular clock does not hold. Despite these obstacles, we derived estimates of primate divergence dates that were well supported by the data and were generally consistent with the paleontological record. Estimation of the mouse-rat divergence date, however, was problematic.

N2  - Analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences from three species of Habronattus jumping spiders (Chelicerata: Arachnida: Araneae) reveal unusual inferred tRNA secondary structures and gene arrangements, providing new information on tRNA evolution within chelicerate arthropods. Sequences from the protein-coding genes NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1), cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI), and subunit II (COII) were obtained, along with tRNA, tRNA, and large-subunit ribosomal RNA (16S) sequences; these revealed several peculiar features. First, inferred secondary structures of tRNA and, likely, tRNA, lack the TΨC arm and the variable arm and therefore do not form standard cloverleaf structures. In place of these arms is a 5-6-nt T arm-variable loop (TV) replacement loop such as that originally described from nematode mitochondrial tRNAs. Intraspecific variation occurs in the acceptor stem sequences in both tRNAs. Second, while the proposed secondary structure of the 3' end of 16S is similar to that reported for insects, the sequence at the 5' end is extremely divergent, and the entire gene is truncated about 300 nt with respect to Drosophila yakuba. Third, initiation codons appear to consist of ATY (ATT and ATC) and TTG for ND1 and COII, respectively. Finally, Habronattus shares the same ND1-tRNA-16S gene arrangement as insects and crustaceans, thus illustrating variation in a tRNA gene arrangement previously proposed as a character distinguishing chelicerates from insects and crustaceans.

N2  - Most molecular phylogenetic studies of vertebrates have been based on DNA sequences of mitochondrial-encoded genes. MtDNA evolves rapidly and is thus particularly useful for resolving relationships among recently evolved groups. However, it has the disadvantage that all of the mitochondrial genes are inherited as a single linkage group so that only one independent gene tree can be inferred regardless of the number of genes sequenced. Introns of nuclear genes are attractive candidates for independent sources of rapidly evolving DNA: they are pervasive, most of their nucleotides appear to be unconstrained by selection, and PCR primers can be designed for sequences in adjacent exons where nucleotide sequences are conserved. We sequenced intron 7 of the β-fibrinogen gene (β-fibint7) for a diversity of woodpeckers and compared the phylogenetic signal and nucleotide substitution properties of this DNA sequence with that of mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome b (cyt b) from a previous study. A few indels (insertions and deletions) were found in the β-fibint7 sequences, but alignment was not difficult, and the indels were phylogentically informative. The β-fibint7 and cyt b gene trees were nearly identical to each other but differed in significant ways from the traditional woodpecker classification. Cyt b evolves 2.8 times as fast as β-fibint7 (14.0 times as fast at third codon positions). Despite its relatively slow substitution rate, the phylogenetic signal in β-fibint7 is comparable to that in cyt b for woodpeckers, because β-fibint7 has less base composition bias and more uniform nucleotide substitution probabilities. As a consequence, compared with cyt b, β-fibint7 nucleotide sites are expected to enter more distinct character states over the course of evolution and have fewer multiple substitutions and lower levels of homoplasy. Moreover, in contrast to cyt b, in which nearly two thirds of nucleotide sites rarely vary among closely related taxa, virtually all β-fibint7 nucleotide sites appear free of selective constraints, which increases informative sites per unit sequenced. However, the estimated gamma distribution used to model rate variation among sites suggests constraints on some β-fibint7 sites. This study suggests that introns will be useful for phylogenetic studies of recently evolved groups.

N2  - The buzzatii complex of the mulleri subgroup (Drosophila repleta group) consists of three clusters of species whose evolutionary relationships are poorly known. We analyzed 2,085 coding nucleotides from the xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) gene in the 10 available species of the complex and Drosophila mulleri and Drosophila hydei. We adopted a statistical model-fitting approach within the maximum-likelihood (ML) framework of phylogenetic inference. We first modeled the process of nucleotide substitution using a tree topology which was reasonably accurate. Then we used the most satisfactory description so attained to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships in the buzzatii complex. We found that a minimally realistic description of the substitution process of Xdh should allow six substitution types and different substitution rates for codon positions. Using this description we obtained a strongly supported, fully resolved tree which is congruent with the already-known (yet few) relationships. We also analyzed published data from three mitochondrial cytochrome oxidases (CO I, II, and III). In our analyses, these relatively short DNA sequences failed to discriminate statistically among alternative phylogenies. When the data of these three gene regions are combined with the Xdh sequences, the phylogenetic signal emerging from Xdh becomes reinforced. All four of the gene regions evolve faster in the buzzatii and martensis clusters than in the stalkeri cluster, paralleling the amount of chromosomal evolution.

N2  - Paralogous sequences of the RPB2 gene are demonstrated in the angiosperm order Gentianales. Two different copies were found by using different PCR primer pairs targeting a region that corresponds to exons 22-24 in the Arabidopsis RPB2 gene. One of the copies (RPB2-d) lacks introns in this region, whereas the other has introns at locations corresponding to those of green plants previously investigated. When analyzed with other available RPB2 sequences from this region, all 28 RPB2-d sequences obtained from the Gentianales and the four sequences from the Lamiales form a monophyletic group, together with a previously published tomato cDNA sequence. The substitution patterns, relative rates of change, and nucleotide compositions of the two paralogous RPB2 exon regions are similar, and none of them shows any signs of being a pseudogene. Although multiple copies of similar, paralogous sequences can confound phylogenetic interpretations, the lack of introns in RPB2-d make a priori homology assessment easy. The phylogenetic utility of RPB2-d within the Gentianales is evaluated in comparison with the chloroplast genes ndhF and rbcL. The hierarchical information in the RPB2-d region sequenced is more incongruent with that of the plastid genes than the plastid genes are with each other as determined by incongruence length difference tests. In contrast to the plastid genes, parsimony-informative third codon positions of RPB2 have a significantly higher rate of change than first and second positions. Topologically, the trees from the three genes are similar, and the differences are usually only weakly supported. In terms of support, RPB2 gives the highest jackknife support per sequenced nucleotide, whereas ndhF gives the highest Bremer support per sequenced nucleotide. The RPB2-d locus has the potential to be a valuable nuclear marker for determination of phylogenetic relationships within the euasterid I group of plants.

N2  - Patterns of substitution in chloroplast encoded trnL-F regions were compared between species of Actaea (Ranunculales), Digitalis (Scrophulariales), Drosera (Caryophyllales), Panicoideae (Poales), the small chromosome species clade of Pelargonium (Geraniales), each representing a different order of flowering plants, and Huperzia (Lycopodiales). In total, the study included 265 taxa, each with >900-bp sequences, totaling 0.24 Mb. Both pairwise and phylogeny-based comparisons were used to assess nucleotide substitution patterns. In all six groups, we found that transition/transversion ratios, as estimated by maximum likelihood on most-parsimonious trees, ranged between 0.8 and 1.0 for ingroups. These values occurred both at low sequence divergences, where substitutional saturation, i.e., multiple substitutions having occurred at the same (homologous) nucleotide position, was not expected, and at higher levels of divergence. This suggests that the angiosperm trnL-F regions evolve in a pattern different from that generally observed for nuclear and animal mtDNA (transition/transversion ratio ≥ 2). Transition/transversion ratios in the intron and the spacer region differed in all alignments compared, yet base compositions between the regions were highly similar in all six groups. A↔T and G↔C transversions were significantly less frequent than the other four substitution types. This correlates with results from studies on fidelity mechanisms in DNA replication that predict A↔T and G↔C transversions to be least likely to occur. It therefore strengthens confidence in the link between mutation bias at the polymerase level and the actual fixation of substitutions as recorded on evolutionary trees and, concomitantly, in the neutrality of nucleotide substitutions as phylogenetic markers.

N2  - Genes coding for the core histones H2a, H2b, H3, and H4 of Giardia lamblia were sequenced. A conserved organism- and gene-specific element, GRGCGCAGATTTVGG, was found upstream of the coding region in all core histone genes. The derived amino acid sequences of all four histones were similar to their homologs in other eukaryotes, although they were among the most divergent members of this protein family. Comparative protein structure modeling combined with energy evaluation of the resulting models indicated that the G. lamblia core histones individually and together can assume the same three-dimensional structures that were established by X-ray crystallography for Xenopus laevis histones and the nucleosome core particle. Since G. lamblia represents one of the earliest-diverging eukaryotes in many different molecular trees, the structure of its histones is potentially of relevance to understanding histone evolution. The G. lamblia proteins do not represent an intermediate stage between archaeal and eukaryotic histones.

N2  - Uncovering the correct phylogeny of closely related species requires analysis of multiple gene genealogies or, alternatively, genealogies inferred from the multiple alleles found at highly polymorphic loci, such as microsatellites. However, a concern in using microsatellites is that constraints on allele sizes may occur, resulting in homoplasious distributions of alleles, leading to incorrect phylogenies. Seven microsatellites from the pathogenic fungus Coccidioides immitis were sequenced for 20 clinical isolates chosen to represent the known genetic diversity of the pathogen. An organismal phylogeny for C. immitis was inferred from microsatellite-flanking sequence polymorphisms and other restriction fragment length polymorphism-containing loci. Two microsatellite genetic distances were then used to determine phylogenies for C. immitis, and the trees found by these three methods were compared. Congruence between the organismal and microsatellite phylogenies occurred when microsatellite distances were based on simple allele frequency data. However, complex mutation events at some loci made distances based on stepwise mutation models unreliable. Estimates of times of divergence for the two species of C. immitis based on microsatellites were significantly lower than those calculated from flanking sequence, most likely due to constraints on microsatellite allele sizes. Flanking-sequence insertions/deletions significantly decreased the accuracy of genealogical information inferred from microsatellite loci and caused interspecific length homoplasies at one of the seven loci. Our analysis shows that microsatellites are useful phylogenetic markers, although care should be taken to choose loci with appropriate flanking sequences when they are intended for use in evolutionary studies.

N2  - Mucins, the major component of mucus, contain tandemly repeated sequences that differ from one mucin to another. Considerable advances have been made in recent years in our knowledge of mucin genes. The availability of the complete genomic and cDNA sequences of MUC5B, one of the four human mucin genes clustered on chromosome 11, provides an exemplary model for studying the molecular evolution of large mucins. The emerging picture is one of expansion of mucin genes by gene duplications, followed by internal repeat expansion that strictly preserves frameshift. Computational and phylogenetic analyses have permitted the proposal of an evolutionary history of the four human mucin genes located on chromosome 11 from an ancestor gene common to the human von Willebrand factor gene and the suggestion of a model for the evolution of the repeat coding portion of the MUC5B gene from a hypothetical ancestral minigene. The characterization of MUC5B, a member of the large secreted gel-forming mucin family, offers a new model for the comparative study of the structure-function relationship within this important family.

N2  - The Ty3/gypsy family of retroelements is closely related to retroviruses, and some of their members have an open reading frame resembling the retroviral gene env. Sequences homologous to the gypsy element from Drosophila melanogaster are widely distributed among Drosophila species. In this work, we report a phylogenetic study based mainly on the analysis of the 5' region of the env gene from several species of the obscura group, and also from sequences already reported of D. melanogaster, Drosophila virilis, and Drosophila hydei. Our results indicate that the gypsy elements from species of the obscura group constitute a monophyletic group which has strongly diverged from the prototypic D. melanogaster gypsy element. Phylogenetic relationships between gypsy sequences from the obscura group are consistent with those of their hosts, indicating vertical transmission. However, D. hydei and D. virilis gypsy sequences are closely related to those of the affinis subgroup, which could be indicative of horizontal transmission.

N2  - The structure-function relationship in RNA molecules is a key to understanding of the expression of genetic information. Various types of RNA play crucial roles at almost every step of protein biosynthesis. In recent years, it has been shown that one of the most important structural elements in RNA is a wobble pair G-U. In this paper, we present for the first time an analysis of the distribution of G-U pairs in eukaryotic 5S ribosomal RNAs. Interestingly, the G-U pair in 5S rRNA species is predominantly found in two intrahelical regions of the stems I and V and at the junction of helix IV and loop A. The distribution of G-U pairs and the nature of adjacent bases suggests their possible role as a recognition site in interactions with other components of protein biosynthesis machinery.

N2  - Thyroid hormones are involved in the regulation of growth and metabolism in all vertebrates. Transthyretin is one of the extracellular proteins with high affinity for thyroid hormones which determine the partitioning of these hormones between extracellular compartments and intracellular lipids. During vertebrate evolution, both the tissue pattern of expression and the structure of the gene for transthyretin underwent characteristic changes. The purpose of this study was to characterize the position of Insectivora in the evolution of transthyretin in eutherians, a subclass of Mammalia. Transthyretin was identified by thyroxine binding and Western analysis in the blood of adult shrews, hedgehogs, and moles. Transthyretin is synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream, similar to the situation for other adult eutherians, birds, and diprotodont marsupials, but different from that for adult fish, amphibians, reptiles, monotremes, and Australian polyprotodont marsupials. For the characterization of the structure of the gene and the processing of mRNA for transthyretin, cDNA libraries were prepared from RNA from hedgehog and shrew livers, and full-length cDNA clones were isolated and sequenced. Sections of genomic DNA in the regions coding for the splice sites between exons 1 and 2 were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The location of splicing was deduced from comparison of genomic with cDNA nucleotide sequences. Changes in the nucleotide sequence of the transthyretin gene during evolution are most pronounced in the region coding for the N-terminal region of the protein. Both the derived overall amino sequences and the N-terminal regions of the transthyretins in Insectivora were found to be very similar to those in other eutherians but differed from those found in marsupials, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Also, the pattern of transthyretin precursor mRNA splicing in Insectivora was more similar to that in other eutherians than to that in marsupials, reptiles, and birds. Thus, in contrast to the marsupials, with a different pattern of transthyretin gene expression in the evolutionarily "older" polyprotodonts compared with the evolutionarily "younger" diprotodonts, no separate lineages of transthyretin evolution could be identified in eutherians. We conclude that transthyretin gene expression in the liver of adult eutherians probably appeared before the branching of the lineages leading to modern eutherian species.

N2  - We fit a Markov chain model of microsatellite evolution introduced by Kruglyak et al. to data on all di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats in the yeast genome. Our results suggest that many features of the distribution of abundance and length of microsatellites can be explained by this simple model, which incorporates a competition between slippage events and base pair substitutions, with no need to invoke selection or constraints on the lengths. Our results provide some new information on slippage rates for individual repeat motifs, which suggest that AT-rich trinucleotide repeats have higher slippage rates. As our model predicts, we found that many repeats were adjacent to shorter repeats of the same motif. However, we also found a significant tendency of microsatellites of different motifs to cluster.

N2  - Two spurious nodes were found in phylogenetic analyses of vertebrate rhodopsin sequences in comparison with well-established vertebrate relationships. These spurious reconstructions were well supported in bootstrap analyses and occurred independently of the method of phylogenetic analysis used (parsimony, distance, or likelihood). Use of this data set of vertebrate rhodopsin sequences allowed us to exploit established vertebrate relationships, as well as the considerable amount known about the molecular evolution of this gene, in order to identify important factors contributing to the spurious reconstructions. Simulation studies using parametric bootstrapping indicate that it is unlikely that the spurious nodes in the parsimony analyses are due to long branches or other topological effects. Rather, they appear to be due to base compositional bias at third positions, codon bias, and convergent evolution at nucleotide positions encoding the hydrophobic residues isoleucine, leucine, and valine. LogDet distance methods, as well as maximum-likelihood methods which allow for nonstationary changes in base composition, reduce but do not entirely eliminate support for the spurious resolutions. Inclusion of five additional rhodopsin sequences in the phylogenetic analyses largely corrected one of the spurious reconstructions while leaving the other unaffected. The additional sequences not only were more proximal to the corrected node, but were also found to have intermediate levels of base composition and codon bias as compared with neighboring sequences on the tree. This study shows that the spurious reconstructions can be corrected either by excluding third positions, as well as those encoding the amino acids Ile, Val, and Leu (which may not be ideal, as these sites can contain useful phylogenetic signal for other parts of the tree), or by the addition of sequences that reduce problems associated with convergent evolution.

N2  - The occurrence and relative positions of cysteine residues were investigated in proteins of various species. Considering random mathematical occurrence for an amino acid coded by two codons (3.28%), cysteine is underrepresented in all organisms investigated. Representation of cysteine appears to correlate positively with the complexity of the organism, ranging between 2.26% in mammals and 0.5% in some members of the Archeabacteria order. This observation, together with the results obtained from comparison of cysteine content of various ribosomal proteins, indicates that evolution takes advantage of increased use of cysteine residues. In all organisms studied except plants, two cysteines are frequently found two amino acid residues apart (C-(X)2-C motif). Such a motif is known to be present in a variety of metal-binding proteins and oxidoreductases. Remarkably, more than 21% of all of cysteines were found within the C-(X)2-C motifs in Archea. This observation may indicate that cysteine appeared in ancient metal-binding proteins first and was introduced into other proteins later.

N2  - Dosage compensation in Drosophila is mediated by genes known as "male-specific lethals" (msls). Several msls, including male-specific lethal-3 (msl-3), encode proteins of unknown function. We cloned the Drosophila virilis msl-3 gene. Using the information provided by the sequences of the Drosophila melanogaster and D. virilis genes, we found that sequences of other species can be aligned along their entire lengths with msl-3. Among them, there are genes in yeasts (the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Alp13 gene, as well as a putative Alp13 homolog, found in Saccharomyces cerevisae) and in mammals (MRG15 and MSL3L1 and their relatives) plus uncharacterized sequences of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and the plants Arabidopsis thaliana, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Zea mays. A second Drosophila gene of this family has also been found. It is thus likely that msl-3-like genes are present in all eukaryotes. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that msl-3 is orthologous to the mammalian MSL3L1 genes, while the second Drosophila melanogaster gene (which we have called Dm MRG15) is orthologous to mammalian MRG15. These analyses also suggest that the msl-3/MRG15 duplication occurred after the fungus/animal split, while an independent duplication occurred in plants. The proteins encoded by these genes have similar structures, including a putative chromodomain close to their N-terminal end and a putative leucine zipper at their C-terminus. The possible functional roles of these proteins are discussed.

N2  - In phylogenetic inference by maximum-parsimony (MP), minimum-evolution (ME), and maximum-likelihood (ML) methods, it is customary to conduct extensive heuristic searches of MP, ME, and ML trees, examining a large number of different topologies. However, these extensive searches tend to give incorrect tree topologies. Here we show by extensive computer simulation that when the number of nucleotide sequences (m) is large and the number of nucleotides used (n) is relatively small, the simple MP or ML tree search algorithms such as the stepwise addition (SA) plus nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) search and the SA plus subtree pruning regrafting (SPR) search are as efficient as the extensive search algorithms such as the SA plus tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) search in inferring the true tree. In the case of ME methods, the simple neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm is as efficient as or more efficient than the extensive NJ+TBR search. We show that when ME methods are used, the simple p distance generally gives better results in phylogenetic inference than more complicated distance measures such as the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano (HKY) distance, even when nucleotide substitution follows the HKY model. When ML methods are used, the simple Jukes-Cantor (JC) model of phylogenetic inference generally shows a better performance than the HKY model even if the likelihood value for the HKY model is much higher than that for the JC model. This indicates that at least in the present case, selecting of a substitution model by using the likelihood ratio test or the AIC index is not appropriate. When n is small relative to m and the extent of sequence divergence is high, the NJ method with p distance often shows a better performance than ML methods with the JC model. However, when the level of sequence divergence is low, this is not the case.

N2  - We isolated 96 dinucleotide repeats with five or more tandemly repeated units from a subgenomic Drosophila subobscura library. The mean repeat unit length of microsatellite clones in D. subobscura is 15, higher than that observed in other Drosophila species. Population variation was assayed in 32-40 chromosomes from Barcelona, Spain, using 18 randomly chosen microsatellite loci. Positive correlation between measures of variation and perfect repeat length measures (mean size, most common, and longest allele) is consistent with a higher mutation rate in loci with longer repeat units. Levels of microsatellite variation measured as variance in repeat number and heterozygosity in D. subobscura were similar to those of Drosophila pseudoobscura and higher than those of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. Our data suggest that higher levels of microsatellite variation, and possibly density, in D. subobscura compared with D. melanogaster are due to both a higher average effective population and a higher intrinsic slippage rate in the former species.

N2  - The complete genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated for intrachromosomal duplications at the level of nucleotide sequences. The analysis was performed by looking for long approximate repeats (from 30 to 3,885 bp) present on each of the chromosomes. We show that direct and inverted repeats exhibit very different characteristics: the two copies of direct repeats are more similar and longer than those of inverted repeats. Furthermore, contrary to the inverted repeats, a large majority of direct repeats appear to be closely spaced. The distance (delta) between the two copies is generally smaller than 1 kb. Further analysis of these "close direct repeats" shows a negative correlation between delta and the percentage of identity between the two copies, and a positive correlation between delta and repeat length. Moreover, contrary to the other categories of repeats, close direct repeats are mostly located within coding sequences (CDSs). We propose two hypotheses in order to interpret these observations: first, the deletion/conversion rate is negatively correlated with delta; second, there exists an active duplication mechanism which continuously creates close direct repeats, the other intrachromosomal repeats being the result, by chromosomal rearrangements of these "primary repeats."

N2  - Recently, the use of microsatellites as genetic markers has become very popular. While their evolutionary dynamics are not yet fully understood, the emerging picture is that several factors are influencing microsatellite mutation rates. Recent experiments demonstrated a significant effect of repeat motif length on microsatellite mutation rates. Here, we studied the influence of the base composition of the microsatellite. Forty-two microsatellite loci on the second chromosome with the three most abundant dinucleotide repeat motifs (TC/AG, AT/TA, GT/CA) were characterized for six different Drosophila melanogaster populations. Applying ANOVA to the variance in repeat number, we found a significant influence of repeat motif on microsatellite variability. Calculating relative mutation rates, GT/CA appears to have the highest mutation rate, and AT/TA appears to have the lowest. Similar differences in mutation rates were obtained by an alternative method which estimates microsatellite mutation rates from their genomic length distribution.

N2  - In order to investigate the evolution of conotoxin multigene families among two closely related vermivorous Conus species, we sequenced 104 four-loop conotoxin mRNAs from two individuals of Conus ebraeus and compared these with sequences already obtained from Conus abbreviatus. In contrast to the diversity of conotoxin sequences obtained from C. abbreviatus, only two common sequence variants were recovered from C. ebraeus. Segregation patterns of the variants in these two individuals and restriction digests of four-loop conotoxin amplification products from nine additional individuals suggest that the common variants are alleles from a single locus. These two putative alleles differ at nine positions that occur nonrandomly in the toxin-coding region of the sequences. Moreover, all substitutions are at nonsynonymous sites and are responsible for seven amino acid differences among the predicted amino acid sequences of the alleles. These results imply that conotoxin diversity is driven by strong diversifying selection and some form of frequency-dependent or overdominant selection at conotoxin loci, and they suggest that diverse conotoxin multigene families can originate from duplications at polymorphic loci. Furthermore, none of the sequences recovered from C. ebraeus appeared to be orthologs of loci from C. abbreviatus, and attempts to amplify orthologous sequences with locus-specific primers were unsuccessful among these species. These patterns suggest that venoms of closely related Conus species may differ due to the differential expression of conotoxin loci.

N2  - Jingwei (jgw) is the first gene found to be of sufficiently recent origin in Drosophila to offer insights into the origin of a gene. While its chimerical gene structure was partially resolved as including a retrosequence of alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh), the structure of its non-Adh parental gene, the donor of the N-terminal domain of jgw, is unclear. We characterized this non-Adh parental locus, yellow emperor (ymp), by cloning it, mapping it onto the polytene chromosomes, sequencing the entire locus, and examining its expression patterns in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that ymp is located in the 96-E region; the N-terminal domain of ymp has donated the non-Adh portion of jgw via a duplication. The similar 5' portions of the gene and its regulatory sequences give rise to similar testis-specific expression patterns in ymp and jgw in Drosophila teissieri. Furthermore, between-species comparison of ymp revealed purifying selection in the protein sequence, suggesting a functional constraint in ymp. While the structure of ymp provides clear information for the molecular origin of the new gene jgw, it unexpectedly casts a new light on the concept of genes. We found, for the first time, that the single locus of the ymp gene encompasses three major molecular mechanisms determining structure of eukaryotic genes: (1) the 5' exons of ymp are involved in an exon-shuffling event that has created the portion recruited by jgw; (2) using alternative cleavage sites and alternative splicing sites, the 3' exon groups of ymp produce two proteins with nonhomologous C-terminal domains, both exclusively in the testis; and (3) in the opposite strand of the third intron of ymp is an essential gene, musashi (msi), which encodes an RNA-binding protein. The composite gene structure of ymp manifests the complexity of the gene concept, which should be considered in genomic research, e.g., gene finding.

N2  - Polymorphism for a 42-kb chloroplast DNA inversion was detected in five species of Abies and two species of Tsuga based on a sample of 1,281 individuals and both Southern hybridization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Two haplotypes were observed in all populations and species. The 42-kb inversion is associated with a short inverted repeat that includes trnS, psaM, and trnG. The frequencies of the two haplotypes within species were very similar among the five species of Abies. This polymorphism has been maintained within populations and species in both Abies and Tsuga, probably because the mutation rate of the inversion is high. Haplotype frequencies had no geographical tendencies for any species except Abies mariesii, in which haplotype frequencies varied clinally, possibly as a result of rapid dissemination after the most recent glacial period and random genetic drift.

N2  - A novel family of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) named Pony was discovered in the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. It has all the characteristics of MITEs, including terminal inverted repeats, no coding potential, A+T richness, small size, and the potential to form stable secondary structures. Past mobility of Pony was indicated by the identification of two Pony insertions which resulted in the duplication of the TA dinucleotide targets. Two highly divergent subfamilies, A and B, were identified in A. aegypti based on sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of 38 elements. These subfamilies showed less than 62% sequence similarity. However, within each subfamily, most elements were highly conserved, and multiple subgroups could be identified, indicating recent amplifications from different source genes. Different scenarios are presented to explain the evolutionary history of these subfamilies. Both subfamilies share conserved terminal inverted repeats similar to those of the Tc2 DNA transposons in Caenorhabditis elegans, indicating that Pony may have been borrowing the transposition machinery from a Tc2-like transposon in mosquitoes. In addition to the terminal inverted repeats, full-length and partial subterminal repeats of a sequence motif TTGATTCAWATTCCGRACA represent the majority of the conservation between the two subfamilies, indicating that they may be important structural and/or functional components of the Pony elements. In contrast to known autonomous DNA transposons, both subfamilies of Pony are highly reiterated in the A. aegypti genome (8,400 and 9,900 copies, respectively). Together, they constitute approximately 1.1% of the entire genome. Pony elements were frequently found near other transposable elements or in the noncoding regions of genes. The relative abundance of MITEs varies in eukaryotic genomes, which may have in part contributed to the different organizations of the genomes and reflect different types of interactions between the hosts and these widespread transposable elements.

N2  - Muntjac deer (Muntiacinae, Cervidae) are of great interest in evolutionary studies because of their dramatic chromosome variations and recent discoveries of several new species. In this paper, we analyze the evolution of karyotypes of muntjac deer in the context of a phylogeny which is based on 1,844-bp mitochondrial DNA sequences of seven generally recognized species in the muntjac subfamily. The phylogenetic results support the hypothesis that karyotypic evolution in muntjac deer has proceeded via reduction in diploid number. However, the reduction in number is not always linear, i.e., not strictly following the order: 46→14/13→8/9→6/7. For example, Muntiacus muntjak (2n = 6/7) shares a common ancestor with Muntiacus feae (2n = 13/14), which indicates that its karyotype was derived in parallel with M. feae's from an ancestral karyotype of 2n ≥ 13/14. The newly discovered giant muntjac (Muntiacus vuquangensis) may represent another parallel reduction lineage from the ancestral 2n = 46 karyotype. Our phylogenetic results indicate that the giant muntjac is relatively closer to Muntiacus reevesi than to other muntjacs and may be placed in the genus Muntiacus. Analyses of sequence divergence reveal that the rate of change in chromosome number in muntjac deer is one of the fastest in vertebrates. Within the muntjac subfamily, the fastest evolutionary rate is found in the Fea's lineage, in which two species with different karyotypes diverged in around 0.5 Myr.

N2  - The complete mitochondrial genome of Tupaia belangeri, a representative of the eutherian order Scandentia, was determined and compared with full-length mitochondrial sequences of other eutherian orders described to date. The complete mitochondrial genome is 16,754 nt in length, with no obvious deviation from the general organization of the mammalian mitochondrial genome. Thus, features such as start codon usage, incomplete stop codons, and overlapping coding regions, as well as the presence of tandem repeats in the control region, are within the range of mammalian mitochondrial (mt) DNA variation. To address the question of a possible close phylogenetic relationship between primates and Tupaia, the evolutionary affinities among primates, Tupaia and bats as representatives of the Archonta superorder, ferungulates, guinea pigs, armadillos, rats, mice, and hedgehogs were examined on the basis of the complete mitochondrial DNA sequences. The opossum sequence was used as an outgroup. The trees, estimated from 12 concatenated genes encoded on the mitochondrial H-strand, add further molecular evidence against an Archonta monophyly. With the new data described in this paper, most of both the mitochondrial and the nuclear data point away from Scandentia as the closest extant relatives to primates. Instead, the complete mitochondrial data support a clustering of Scandentia with Lagomorpha connecting to the branch leading to ferungulates. This closer phylogenetic relationship of Tupaia to rabbits than to primates first received support from several analyses of nuclear and partial mitochondrial DNA data sets. Given that short sequences are of limited use in determining deep mammalian relationships, the partial mitochondrial data available to date support this hypothesis only tentatively. Our complete mitochondrial genome data therefore add considerably more evidence in support of this hypothesis.

N2  - It has recently been discovered that the Alcohol dehydrogenase and Alcohol dehydrogenase-related genes of Drosophila melanogaster and closely related species constitute a single transcription unit and that the Alcohol dehydrogenase-related gene is exclusively expressed from a dicistronic mRNA. Here, we show that in Drosophila lebanonensis, subgenus Scaptodrosophila, Adhr is also transcribed as a dicistronic transcript with Adh. Using degenerate primers designed on the sequence of the known ADHR proteins, we have been able to amplify and sequence a partial sequence of Adhr in species representative of the whole subgenus Drosophila. This has allowed the study of the organization and expression of Adhr in Drosophila buzzatii. We find that in D. buzzatii Adhr is transcribed as a monocistronic transcript. Adh and Adhr are believed to originate by duplication, and our data suggest that the cotranscription of these two genes was the primitive state, and that their independent transcription in the subgenus Drosophila is derived. We can rationalize the D. buzzatii condition as being correlated with the two genes evolving independent transcriptional control. However, why these two genes with clear divergence in the functions of their proteins should remain cotranscribed in groups as divergent as the subgenus Sophophora and the subgenus Scaptodrosophila remains a mystery.

N2  - Phylogenetic analysis conducted on a 784-bp fragment of 82 actin gene sequences of 44 coleoid cephalopod taxa, along with results obtained from genomic Southern blot analysis, confirmed the presence of at least three distinct actin loci in coleoids. Actin isoforms were characteri zed through phylogenetic analysis of representative cephalopod sequences from each of the three isoforms, along with translated actin cDNA sequences from a diverse array of metazoan taxa downloaded from GenBank. One of the three isoforms found in cephalopods was closely related to actin sequences expressed in the muscular tissues of other molluscs. A second isoform was most similar to cytoplasmic-specific actin amino acid sequences. The muscle type actins of molluscs were found to be distinct from those of arthropods, suggesting at least two independent derivations of muscle actins in the protostome lineage, although statistical support for this conclusion was lacking. Parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses of two of the isoforms from which >30 orthologous coleoid sequences had been obtained (one of the cytoplasmic actins and the muscle actin) supported the monophyly of several higher-level coleoid taxa. These included the superorders Octopodiformes and Decapodiformes, the order Octopoda, the octopod suborder Incirrata, and the teuthoid suborder Myopsida. The monophyly of several taxonomic groups within the Decapodiformes was not supported, including the orders Teuthoidea and Sepioidea and the teuthoid suborder Oegopsida. Parametric bootstrap analysis conducted on the simulated cytoplasmic actin data set provided statistical support to reject the monophyly of the Sepioidea. Although parametric bootstrap analysis of the muscle actin isoform did not reject sepioid monophyly at the 5% level, the results (rejection at P = 0.068) were certainly suggestive of sepioid nonmonophyly.

N2  - DNA melting is rate-limiting for cytosine deamination, from which we infer that the rate of cytosine deamination should decline twofold for each 10% increase in GC content. Analysis of human DNA sequence data confirms that this is the case for 5-methylcytosine. Several lines of evidence further confirm that it is also the case for unmethylated cytosine and that cytosine deamination causes the majority of all C→T and G→A transitions in mammals. Thus, cytosine deamination and DNA base composition each affect the other, forming a positive feedback loop that facilitates divergent genetic drift to high or low GC content. Because a 10°C increase in temperature in vitro increases the rate of cytosine deamination 5.7-fold, cytosine deamination must be highly dependent on body temperature, which is consistent with the dramatic differences between the isochores of warm-blooded versus cold-blooded vertebrates. Because this process involves both DNA melting and positive feedback, it would be expected to spread progressively (in evolutionary time) down the length of the chromosome, which is consistent with the large size of isochores in modern mammals.

N2  - To gain an understanding of the evolution and genomic context of avian major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) genes, we sequenced a 38.8-kb Mhc-bearing cosmid insert from a red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus). The DNA sequence, the longest yet retrieved from a bird other than a chicken, provides a detailed view of the process of gene duplication, divergence, and degeneration ("birth and death") in the avian Mhc, as well as a glimpse into major noncoding features of a songbird genome. The peptide-binding region (PBR) of the single Mhc class II B gene in this region, Agph-DAB2, is almost devoid of polymorphism, and a still-segregating single-base-pair deletion and other features suggest that it is nonfunctional. Agph-DAB2 is estimated to have diverged about 40 MYA from a previously characterized and highly polymorphic blackbird Mhc gene, Aph-DAB1, and is therefore younger than most mammalian Mhc paralogs and arose relatively late in avian evolution. Despite its nonfunctionality, Agph-DAB2 shows very high levels of nonsynonymous divergence from Agph-DAB1 and from reconstructed ancestral sequences in antigen-binding PBR codons--a strong indication of a period of adaptive divergence preceding loss of function. We also found that the region sequenced contains very few other unambiguous genes, a partial Mhc- class II gene fragment, and a paucity of simple-sequence and other repeats. Thus, this sequence exhibits some of the genomic streamlining expected for avian as compared with mammalian genomes, but is not as densely packed with functional genes as is the chicken Mhc.

N2  - To examine temporal changes in population genetic structure, we compared the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of three populations that lived in the same location, Linzi, China, in different periods: 2,500 years ago (the Spring-Autumn era), 2,000 years ago (the Han era), and the present day. Two indices were used to compare the genetic differences: the frequency distributions of the radiating haplotype groups and the genetic distances among the populations. The results indicate that the genetic backgrounds of the three populations are distinct from each other. Inconsistent with the geographical distribution, the 2,500-year-old Linzi population showed greater genetic similarity to present-day European populations than to present-day east Asian populations. The 2,000-year-old Linzi population had features that were intermediate between the present-day European/2,500-year-old Linzi populations and the present-day east Asian populations. These relationships suggest the occurrence of drastic spatiotemporal changes in the genetic structure of Chinese people during the past 2,500 years.

N2  - In the reconstruction of a large phylogenetic tree, the most difficult part is usually the problem of how to explore the topology space to find the optimal topology. We have developed a "divide-and-conquer" heuristic algorithm in which an initial neighbor-joining (NJ) tree is divided into subtrees at internal branches having bootstrap values higher than a threshold. The topology search is then conducted by using the maximum-likelihood method to reevaluate all branches with a bootstrap value lower than the threshold while keeping the other branches intact. Extensive simulation showed that our simple method, the neighbor-joining maximum-likelihood (NJML) method, is highly efficient in improving NJ trees. Furthermore, the performance of the NJML method is nearly equal to or better than existing time-consuming heuristic maximum-likelihood methods. Our method is suitable for reconstructing relatively large molecular phylogenetic trees (number of taxa ≥ 16).

N2  - Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) have been used to generate unambiguous phylogenetic topologies relating eukaryotic taxa. The irreversible nature of SINE retroposition is supported by a large body of comparative genome data and is a fundamental assumption inherent in the value of this qualitative method of inference. Here, we assess the key assumption of unidirectional SINE insertion by comparing the SINE insertion-derived topology and the phylogenetic tree based on seven independent loci of five taxa in the order Cetartiodactyla (Cetacea + Artiodactyla). The data sets and analyses were largely independent, but the loci were, by definition, linked, and thus their consistency supported an irreversible pattern of SINE retroposition. Moreover, our analyses of the flanking sequences provided estimates of divergence times among cetartiodactyl lineages unavailable from SINE insertion analysis alone. Unexpected rate heterogeneity among sites of SINE-flanking sequences and other noncoding DNA sequences were observed. Sequence simulations suggest that this rate heterogeneity may be an artifact resulting from the inaccuracies of the substitution model used.

N2  - MADS-box genes encode a family of transcription factors which control diverse developmental processes in flowering plants ranging from root development to flower and fruit development. Through phylogeny reconstructions, most of these genes can be subdivided into defined monophyletic gene clades whose members share similar expression patterns and functions. Therefore, the establishment of the diversity of gene clades was probably an important event in land plant evolution. In order to determine when these clades originated, we isolated cDNAs of 19 different MADS-box genes from Gnetum gnemon, a gymnosperm model species and thus a representative of the sister group of the angiosperms. Phylogeny reconstructions involving all published MADS-box genes were then used to identify gene clades containing putative orthologs from both angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages. Thus, the minimal number of MADS-box genes that were already present in the last common ancestor of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms was determined. Comparative expression studies involving pairs of putatively orthologous genes revealed a diversity of patterns that has been largely conserved since the time when the angiosperm and gymnosperm lineages separated. Taken together, our data suggest that there were already at least seven different MADS-box genes present at the base of extant seed plants about 300 MYA. These genes were probably already quite diverse in terms of both sequence and function. In addition, our data demonstrate that the MADS-box gene families of extant gymnosperms and angiosperms are of similar complexities.

N2  - We present a new method using nucleic acid secondary structure to assess phylogenetic relationships among species. In this method, which we term "molecular morphometrics," the measurable structural parameters of the molecules (geometrical features, bond energies, base composition, etc.) are used as specific characters to construct a phylogenetic tree. This method relies both on traditional morphological comparison and on molecular sequence comparison. Applied to the phylogenetic analysis of Cirripedia, molecular morphometrics supports the most recent morphological analyses arguing for the monophyly of Cirripedia sensu stricto (Thoracica + Rhizocephala + Acrothoracica). As a proof, a classical multiple alignment was also performed, either using or not using the structural information to realign the sequence segments considered in the molecular morphometrics analysis. These methods yielded the same tree topology as the direct use of structural characters as a phylogenetic signal. By taking into account the secondary structure of nucleic acids, the new method allows investigators to use the regions in which multiple alignments are barely reliable because of a large number of insertions and deletions. It thus appears to be complementary to classical primary sequence analysis in phylogenetic studies.

N2  - Maximum-likelihood models of codon substitution were used to analyze sperm lysin genes of 25 abalone (Haliotis) species to identify lineages and amino acid sites under diversifying selection. The models used the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) as an indicator of selective pressure and allowed the ratio to vary among lineages or sites. Likelihood ratio tests suggested significant variation in selective pressure among lineages. The variable selective pressure provided an explanation for the previous observation that the ω ratio is >1 in comparisons of closely related species and <1 in comparisons of distantly related species. Computer simulations demonstrated that saturation of nonsynonymous substitutions and constraint on lysin structure were unlikely to account for the observed pattern. Lineages linking closely related sympatric species appeared to be under diversifying selection, while lineages separating distantly related species from different geographic locations were associated with low evolutionary rates. The selective pressure indicated by the ω ratio was found to vary greatly among amino acid sites in lysin. Sites under potential diversifying selection were identified. Ancestral lysins were inferred to trace the route of evolution at individual sites and to provide lysin sequences for future laboratory studies.

N2  - Chaperonins are oligomeric protein-folding complexes which are divided into two distantly related structural classes. Group I chaperonins (called GroEL/cpn60/hsp60) are found in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles, while group II chaperonins are present in archaea and the cytoplasm of eukaryotes (called CCT/TriC). While archaea possess one to three chaperonin subunit-encoding genes, eight distinct CCT gene families (paralogs) have been characterized in eukaryotes. We are interested in determining when during eukaryotic evolution the multiple gene duplications producing the CCT subunits occurred. We describe the sequence and phylogenetic analysis of five CCT genes from Trichomonas vaginalis and seven from Giardia lamblia, representatives of amitochondriate protist lineages thought to have diverged early from other eukaryotes. Our data show that the gene duplications producing the eight CCT paralogs took place prior to the organismal divergence of Trichomonas and Giardia from other eukaryotes. Thus, these divergent protists likely possess completely hetero-oligomeric CCT complexes like those in yeast and mammalian cells. No close phylogenetic relationship between the archaeal chaperonins and specific CCT subunits was observed, suggesting that none of the CCT gene duplications predate the divergence of archaea and eukaryotes. The duplications producing the CCTδ and CCTε subunits, as well as CCTα, CCTβ, and CCTη, are the most recent in the CCT gene family. Our analyses show significant differences in the rates of evolution of archaeal chaperonins compared with the eukaryotic CCTs, as well as among the different CCT subunits themselves. We discuss these results in light of current views on the origin, evolution, and function of CCT complexes.

N2  - Multilocus genotyping of microbial pathogens has revealed a range of population structures, with some bacteria showing extensive recombination and others showing almost complete clonality. The population structure of the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been harder to evaluate, since most studies have used a limited number of antigen-encoding loci that are known to be under strong selection. We describe length variation at 12 microsatellite loci in 465 infections collected from 9 locations worldwide. These data reveal dramatic differences in parasite population structure in different locations. Strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) was observed in six of nine populations. Significant LD occurred in all locations with prevalence <1% and in only two of five of the populations from regions with higher transmission intensities. Where present, LD results largely from the presence of identical multilocus genotypes within populations, suggesting high levels of self-fertilization in populations with low levels of transmission. We also observed dramatic variation in diversity and geographical differentiation in different regions. Mean heterozygosities in South American countries (0.3-0.4) were less than half those observed in African locations (0.76-0.8), with intermediate heterozygosities in the Southeast Asia/Pacific samples (0.51-0.65). Furthermore, variation was distributed among locations in South America (FST = 0.364) and within locations in Africa (FST = 0.007). The intraspecific patterns of diversity and genetic differentiation observed in P. falciparum are strikingly similar to those seen in interspecific comparisons of plants and animals with differing levels of outcrossing, suggesting that similar processes may be involved. The differences observed may also reflect the recent colonization of non-African populations from an African source, and the relative influences of epidemiology and population history are difficult to disentangle. These data reveal a range of population structures within a single pathogen species and suggest intimate links between patterns of epidemiology and genetic structure in this organism.

N2  - We analyzed sequence variation for chalcone synthase (Chs) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) loci in 28 species in the genera Arabidopsis and Arabis and related taxa from tribe Arabideae. Chs was single-copy in nearly all taxa examined, while Adh duplications were found in several species. Phylogenies constructed from both loci confirmed that the closest relatives of Arabidopsis thaliana include Arabidopsis lyrata, Arabidopsis petraea, and Arabidopsis halleri (formerly in the genus Cardaminopsis). Slightly more distant are the North American n = 7 Arabis (Boechera) species. The genus Arabis is polyphyletic--some unrelated species appear within this taxonomic classification, which has little phylogenetic meaning. Fossil pollen data were used to compute a synonymous substitution rate of 1.5 x 10 substitutions per site per year for both Chs and Adh. Arabidopsis thaliana diverged from its nearest relatives about 5 MYA, and from Brassica roughly 24 MYA. Independent molecular and fossil data from several sources all provide similar estimates of evolutionary timescale in the Brassicaceae.

N2  - A family of CONSTANS LIKE genes (COLs) has recently been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and other plant species. CONSTANS, the first isolated member, is a putative zinc finger transcription factor that promotes the induction of flowering in A. thaliana in long photoperiods. Phylogenetic analysis of the COL family demonstrated that it is organized into a few distinct groups, some of which evolved before the divergence of gymnosperms and angiosperms. Molecular evolutionary analyses showed that COL genes within the Brassicaceae family evolve rapidly. The number of nonsynonymous substitutions was larger, and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions was higher. The analysis also indicated that the rate of evolution is heterogeneous between different domains in the COL genes. The results support previous data indicating that plant regulatory genes evolve relatively fast and that the rate of evolution varies significantly between different regions of those genes. The rate of evolution of COL genes seems to have accelerated during later stages of evolution, possibly as an effect of frequent gene duplications.

N2  - Respiring mitochondria require many interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from the gorilla and the chimpanzee are able to restore oxidative phosphorylation in a human cell, mtDNAs from more distant primate species are functionally incompatible with human nuclear genes. Using microcell-mediated chromosome and mitochondria transfer, we introduced and maintained a functional orangutan mtDNA in a human nuclear background. However, partial oxidative phosphorylation function was restored only in the presence of most orangutan chromosomes, suggesting that human oxidative phosphorylation-related nuclear-coded genes are not able to replace many orangutan ones. The respiratory capacity of these hybrids was decreased by 65%-80%, and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity was decreased by 85%-95%. The function of other respiratory complexes was not significantly altered. The translation of mtDNA-coded COX subunits was normal, but their steady-state levels were ~10% of normal ones. Nuclear-coded COX subunits were loosely associated with mitochondrial membranes, a characteristic of COX assembly-defective mutants. Our results suggest that many human nuclear-coded genes not only cannot replace the orangutan counterparts, but also exert a specific interference at the level of COX assembly. This cellular model underscores the precision of COX assembly in mammals and sheds light on the nature of nuclear-mtDNA coevolutionary constraints.

N2  - Members of the Emx homeobox gene class are expressed during embryogenesis in the brain and/or other head structures of phylogenetically diverse phyla. Here, we describe sequence, genomic structure, and molecular phylogenetic analysis of a cephalochordate (amphioxus) Emx class gene termed AmphiEmxA. The genomic structure of AmphiEmxA is very similar to that of vertebrate Emx genes, with two conserved intron sites. The Drosophila homolog empty spiracles (ems) has just one intron, which may be shared with chordates; the other has been secondarily lost in this Drosophila gene and in a cnidarian Emx-related gene. We identify a highly conserved peptide motif close to the amino terminus of Emx proteins, demonstrate its similarity to a sequence found in a variety of transcription factors, and argue that it arose through convergent evolution in homeobox and forkhead genes. Finally, our molecular phylogenetic analysis strongly supports the presence of a single Emx gene in the ancestor of chordates and gene duplication along the vertebrate lineage.

N2  - Maximum likelihood (ML) is a widely used criterion for selecting optimal evolutionary trees. However, the nature of the likelihood surface for trees is still not sufficiently understood, especially with regard to the frequency of multiple optima. Here, we initiate an analytic study for identifying sequences that generate multiple optima. We concentrate on the problem of optimizing edge weights for a given tree or trees (as opposed to searching through the space of all trees). We report a new approach to computing ML directly, which we have used to find large families of sequences that have multiple optima, including sequences with a continuum of optimal points. Such data sets are best supported by different (two or more) phylogenies that vary significantly in their timings of evolutionary events. Some standard biological processes can lead to data with multiple optima, and consequently the field needs further investigation. Our results imply that hill-climbing techniques as currently implemented in various software packages cannot guarantee that one will find the global ML point, even if it is unique.

N2  - The roles of selection and horizontal transfer in the evolution of the canonical subfamily of P elements were studied in the saltans and willistoni species groups of the genus Drosophila (subgenus Sophophora). We estimate that the common ancestor of the canonical P subfamily dates back 2-3 Myr at the most, despite the much older age (more than 40 Myr) of the P family as a whole. The evolution of the canonical P subfamily is characterized by weak selection at nonsynonymous sites. These sites have evolved at three quarters the rate of synonymous sites, in which no selective constraints were detected. Their recent horizontal transfer best explains the high degree of similarity among canonical P elements from the saltans and willistoni species groups. These results are consistent with a model of P-element evolution in which selective constraints are imposed at the time of horizontal transfer. Furthermore, it is estimated that the spread and diversification of the canonical subfamily involved a minimum of 11 horizontal transfer events among the 18 species surveyed within the past 3 Myr. The presence of multiple P subfamilies in the saltans and willistoni species groups is likely to be the result of multiple invasions that have previously swept through these taxa in a succession of horizontal transfer events. These results suggest that horizontal transfer among eukaryotes might be more common than anticipated.

N2  - Phylogenetic analyses of the S, M, and L genes of the hantaviruses (Bunyaviridae: Hantavirus) revealed three well-differentiated clades corresponding to viruses parasitic on three subfamilies (Murinae, Arvicolinae, and Sigmodontinae) of the rodent family Muridae. In rooted trees of M and L genes, the viruses with hosts belonging to Murinae formed an outgroup to those with hosts in Arvicolinae and Sigmodontinae. This phylogeny corresponded with a phylogeny of the murid subfamilies based on mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences, supporting the hypothesis that hantaviruses have coevolved with their mammalian hosts at least since the common ancestor of these three subfamilies, which probably occurred about 50 MYA. The nucleocapsid protein (encoded by the S gene) differentiated among the viruses parasitic on the three subfamilies in such a way that a high frequency of amino acid residue charge changes occurred in a hypervariable (HV) portion of the molecule, and nonsynonymous nucleotide differences causing amino acid charge changes in the HV region occurred significantly more frequently than expected under random substitution. Along with evidence that at least in some hantaviruses the HV region is a target for host antibodies and the known importance of charged residues in determining antibody epitopes, these results suggest that changes in the HV region may represent adaptation to host-specific characteristics of the immune response.

N2  - Nucleotide sequences from the c-mos proto-oncogene have previously been used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships between distantly related vertebrate taxa. To explore c-mos variation at shallower levels of avian divergence, we compared c-mos sequences from representative passerine taxa that span a range of evolutionary differentiation, from basal passerine lineages to closely allied genera. Phylogenetic reconstructions based on these c-mos sequences recovered topologies congruent with previous DNA-DNA hybridization-based reconstructions, with many nodes receiving high support, as indicated by bootstrap and reliability values. One exception was the relationship of Acanthisitta to the remaining passerines, where the c-mos-based searches indicated a three-way polytomy involving the Acanthisitta lineage and the suboscine and oscine passerine clades. We also compared levels of c-mos and mitochondrial differentiation across eight oscine passerine taxa and found that c-mos nucleotide substitutions accumulate at a rate similar to that of transversion substitutions in mitochondrial protein-coding genes. These comparisons suggest that nuclear-encoded loci such as c-mos provide a temporal window of phylogenetic resolution that overlaps the temporal range where mitochondrial protein-coding sequences have their greatest utility and that c-mos substitutions and mtDNA transversions can serve as complementary, informative, and independent phylogenetic markers for the study of avian relationships.

N2  - We analyzed the nucleotide contents of several completely sequenced genomes, and we show that nucleotide bias can have a dramatic effect on the amino acid composition of the encoded proteins. By surveying the genes in 21 completely sequenced eubacterial and archaeal genomes, along with the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome and two Plasmodium falciparum chromosomes, we show that biased DNA encodes biased proteins on a genomewide scale. The predicted bias affects virtually all genes within the genome, and it could be clearly seen even when we limited the analysis to sets of homologous gene sequences. Parallel patterns of compositional bias were found within the archaea and the eubacteria. We also found a positive correlation between the degree of amino acid bias and the magnitude of protein sequence divergence. We conclude that mutational bias can have a major effect on the molecular evolution of proteins. These results could have important implications for the interpretation of protein-based molecular phylogenies and for the inference of functional protein adaptation from comparative sequence data.

N2  - The mode of transposition of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) is unknown, but it has been suggested that they are duplicated rather than excised at transposition. However, the present investigation demonstrates that a particular family of MITEs, Stowaway, is excised. Mapped onto a gene tree based on partial sequences of disrupted meiotic cDNA1 (DMC1) from 30 species of the Triticeae grasses, it is evident that at least two excisions have occurred, leaving short footprints. These footprints may subsequently be reduced in length or deleted. Excision of Stowaway elements lends strong support to the suggestion that MITEs are DNA transposons and should be classified as class II elements. The evolution of Stowaway elements can also be traced by scrutiny of the gene tree. It appears that base substitutions are as frequent in the conserved terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) as in the core of the element. Neither substitutions nor deletions lead to compensatory changes; hence, the highly stable secondary structure of the elements may gradually be reduced.

N2  - SGM (Drosophila subobscura, Drosophila guanche, and Drosophila madeirensis) transposons are a family of transposable elements (TEs) in Drosophila with some functional and structural similarities to miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs). These elements were recently active in D. subobscura and D. madeirensis (1-2 MYA), but in D. guanche (3-4 MYA), they gave rise to a species-specifically amplified satellite DNA making up approximately 10% of its genome. SGM elements were already active in the common ancestor of all three species, giving rise to the A-type specific promoter section of the P-related neogene cluster. SGM sequences are similar to elements found in other obscura group species, such as the ISY elements in D. miranda and the ISamb elements in Drosophila ambigua. SGM elements are composed of different sequence modules, and some of them, i.e., LS and LS-core, are found throughout the Drosophila and Sophophora radiation with similarity to more distantly related TEs. The LS-core module is highly enriched in the noncoding sections of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, suggesting potential regulatory host gene functions. The SGM elements can be considered as a model system elucidating the evolutionary dynamics of mobile elements in their arms race with host-directed silencing mechanisms and their evolutionary impact on the structure and composition of their respective host genomes.

N2  - Several type II restriction-modification (RM) gene complexes kill host bacterial cells that have lost them, through attack on the chromosomal recognition sites of these cells. Two RM gene complexes recognizing the same sequence cannot simultaneously enjoy such stabilization through postsegregational host killing, because one will defend chromosomal sites from attack by the other. In the present work, we analyzed intrahost competition between two RM gene complexes when the recognition sequence of one was included in that of the other. When the EcoRII gene complex, recognizing 5'-CCWGG (W = A, T), is lost from the host, the SsoII gene complex, which recognizes 5'-CCNGG (N = A, T, G, C), will prevent host death by protecting CCWGG sites on the chromosome. However, when the SsoII (CCNGG) gene complex is lost, the EcoRII (CCWGG) gene complex will be unable to prevent host death through attack by SsoII on 5'-CCSGG (S = C, G) sites. These predictions were verified in our experiments, in which we analyzed plasmid maintenance, cell growth, cell shape, and chromosomal DNA. Our results demonstrate the presence of selective pressure for decrease in the specificity of recognition sequence of RM systems in the absence of invading DNA.

N2  - CpG and TpA dinucleotides are underrepresented in the human genome. The CpG deficiency is due to the high mutation rate from C to T in methylated CpG's. The TpA suppression was thought to reflect a counterselection against TpA's destabilizing effect in RNA. Unexpectedly, the TpA and CpG deficiencies vary according to the G+C contents of sequences. It has been proposed that the variation in CpG suppression was correlated with a particular chromatin organization in G+C-rich isochores. Here, we present an improved model of dinucleotide evolution accounting for the overlap between successive dinucleotides. We show that an increased mutation rate from CpG to TpG or CpA induces both an apparent TpA deficiency and a correlation between CpG and TpA deficiencies and G+C content. Moreover, this model shows that the ratio of observed over expected CpG frequency underestimates the real CpG deficiency in G+C-rich sequences. The predictions of our model fit well with observed frequencies in human genomic data. This study suggests that previously published selectionist interpretations of patterns of dinucleotide frequencies should be taken with caution. Moreover, we propose new criteria to identify unmethylated CpG islands taking into account this bias in the measure of CpG depletion.

T1  - Structure and Expression of the Variant Melanin-Concentrating Hormone Genes: Only PMCHL1 Is Transcribed in the Developing Human Brain and Encodes a Putative Protein

N2  - PMCHL1 and PMCHL2 are two copies of the so-called variant melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) gene that are located, respectively, on human chromosome 5p14 and 5q13 and that emerged recently during primate evolution. They correspond to a 5'-end truncated version of the MCH gene mapped on chromosome 12q23 and encoding a neuropeptide precursor. The gene organization and regulation of the expression of the variant MCH genes in the human brain are the central issues we investigated. First, the structure and fine chromosomal mapping of the 5p and 5q variant MCH genes were established. These revealed several point mutations and length variations of one CA/TA repeat which allow discrimination between each copy. Using a combination of RACE-PCR, RT-PCR, and sequencing analysis, we provided strong evidence for the expression of the PMCHL1 gene but not the PMCHL2 gene in the human fetal, newborn, and adult brains. Sense, potentially coding, RNAs, as well as noncoding antisense RNAs, were identified and displayed a region-specific expression in the human brain. Strikingly, sense unspliced RNAs of the PMCHL1 gene carried a novel open reading frame and may produce an NLS-containing protein of 8 kDa named VMCH-p8. These transcripts were translated in vitro and in transfected COS cells. Therefore, the PMCHL1 gene provides a unique example of the generation of a gene in the Hominoidae lineage which is specifically transcribed in the developing human brain and has the capacity to be translated into a putative novel protein.

N2  - Comparative genomics is a powerful approach to inference of the dynamics of genome evolution. Most information about the evolution of microsatellites in the genus Drosophila has been obtained from Drosophila melanogaster. For comparison, we collected microsatellite data for the distantly related species Drosophila virilis. Screening about 0.5 Mb of nonredundant genomic sequence from GenBank, we identified 239 dinucleotide microsatellites. On average, D. virilis dinucleotides were significantly longer than D. melanogaster microsatellites (7.69 repeats vs. 6.75 repeats). Similarly, direct cloning of microsatellites resulted in a higher mean repeat number in D. virilis than in D. melanogaster (12.7 repeats vs. 12.2 repeats). Characterization of 11 microsatellite loci mapping to division 40-49 on the fourth chromosome of D. virilis indicated that D. virilis microsatellites are more variable than those of D. melanogaster.

N2  - Molecular loci that fail relative-rate tests are said to be "overdispersed." Traditional molecular-clock approaches to estimating divergence times do not take this into account. In this study, a method was developed to estimate divergence times using loci that may be overdispersed. The approach was to replace the traditional Poisson process assumption with a more general stationary process assumption. A probability model was developed, and an accompanying computer program was written to find maximum-likelihood estimates of divergence times under both the Poisson process and the stationary process assumptions. In simulation, it was shown that confidence intervals under the traditional Poisson assumptions often vastly underestimate the true confidence limits for overdispersed loci. Both models were applied to two data sets: one from land plants, the other from the higher metazoans. In both cases, the traditional Poisson process model could be rejected with high confidence. Maximum-likelihood analysis of the metazoan data set under the more general stationary process suggested that their radiation occurred well over a billion years ago, but confidence intervals were extremely wide. It was also shown that a model consistent with a Cambrian (or nearly Cambrian) origination of the animal phyla, although significantly less likely than a much older divergence, fitted the data well. It is argued that without an a priori understanding of the variance in the time between substitutions, molecular data sets may be incapable of ever establishing the age of the metazoan radiation.

T1  - Ancestral Exonic Organization of FUT8, the Gene Encoding the α6-Fucosyltransferase, Reveals Successive Peptide Domains Which Suggest a Particular Three-Dimensional Core Structure for the α6-Fucosyltransferase Family

N2  - Based on PCR strategies and expression studies, we define the genomic organization of the FUT8b gene. This gene encodes the only known mammalian enzyme transferring fucose in an α1→6 linkage on the asparagine-branched GlcNAc residue of the chitobiose unit of complex N-glycans. The intron/exon organization of the bovine coding sequence determines five successive functional domains. The first exon encodes a domain homologous to cytoskeleton proteins, the second presents a proline-rich region including a motif XPXPPYXP similar to the peptide ligand of the SH3-domain proteins, the third encodes a gyrase-like domain (an enzyme which can bind nucleotides), and the fourth encodes a peptide sequence homologous to the catalytic domain of proteins transferring sugars. Finally, the last exon encodes a domain homologous to the SH3 conserved motif of the SH2-SH3 protein family. This organization suggests that intramolecular interactions might give a tulip-shaped scaffolding, including the catalytic pocket of the enzyme in the Golgi lumen. Deduced from the published sequence of chromosome 14 (AL109847), the human gene organization of FUT8 seems to be similar to that of bovine FUT8b, although the exon partition is more pronounced (bovine exons 1 and 2 correspond to human exons 1-6). The mosaicism and phylogenetic positions of the α6-fucosyltransferase genes are compared with those of other fucosyltransferase genes.

N2  - Rex1, together with the related Babar elements, represents a new family of non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons from fish, which might be related to the CR1 clade of LINE elements. Rex1/Babar retrotransposons encode a reverse transcriptase and an apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, which is very frequently removed by incomplete reverse transcription. Different Rex1 elements show a conserved terminal 3' untranslated region followed by oligonucleotide tandem repeats of variable size and sequence. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Rex1 retrotransposons were frequently active during fish evolution. They formed multiple ancient lineages, which underwent several independent and recent bursts of retrotransposition and invaded fish genomes with varying success (from <5 to 500 copies per haploid genome). At least three of these ancient Rex1 lineages were detected within the genome of poeciliids. One lineage is absent from some poeciliids but underwent successive rounds of retrotransposition in others, thereby increasing its copy number from <10 to about 200. At least three ancient Rex1 lineages were also detected in the genome project fish Fugu rubripes. Rex1 distribution within one of its major lineages is discontinuous: Rex1 was found in all Acanthopterygii (common ancestor in the main teleost lineage approximately 90 MYA) and in both European and Japanese eels (divergence from the main teleost lineage about 180 MYA) but not in trout, pike, carp, and zebrafish (divergence 100-120 MYA). This might either result from frequent loss or rapid divergence of Rex1 elements specifically in some fish lineages or represent one of the very rare examples of horizontal transfer of non-LTR retrotransposons. This analysis highlights the dynamics and complexity of retrotransposon evolution and the variability of the impact of retrotransposons on vertebrate genomes.

N2  - A systematic search of 1 Mb of genomic sequences from the sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis, revealed the presence of six families of transposable elements. The Cigr-1 retrotransposon contains identical 245-bp long terminal repeats (LTRs) and a 3,630-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding translation products in the same order as the domains characteristic of gypsy/Ty3-type LTR retrotransposons. The closest homologs of the reverse transcriptase domain were in gypsy elements from Drosophila and the sushi element from the pufferfish. However, the capsid-nucleocapsid region shows the clearest homology to an echinoderm element, Tgr1. Database searches also indicated two classes of non-LTR retrotransposon, named Cili-1 and Cili-2. The Cili-1 sequences show matches to regions of the ORF2 product of mammalian L1 elements. The Cili-2 sequences possess similarity to the RNaseH domain of Lian-Aa1, a mosquito non-LTR retrotransposon. The most abundant element was a short interspersed nucleotide element named Cics-1 with a copy number estimated at 40,000. Cics-1 consists of two conserved domains separated by an A-rich stretch. The 172-bp 5' domain is related to tRNA sequences, whereas the 110-bp 3' domain is unique. Cics-1 is unusual, not just in its modular structure, but also in its lack of a 3' poly(A) tail or direct flanking repeats. A second abundant element, Cimi-1, has an A+T-rich 193-bp consensus sequence and 30-bp terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and is usually flanked by A+T-rich 2-4-bp putative target site duplications--characteristics of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements found in plants and insects. A single 2,444-bp foldback element was found, possessing long TIRs containing an A+T-rich internal domain, an array of subrepeats, and a flanking domain at the TIR ends; this is the first example of a chordate foldback element. This study provides the first systematic characterization of the families of transposable elements in a lower chordate.

N2  - Hydrogenases, oxygen-sensitive enzymes that can make hydrogen gas, are key to the function of hydrogen-producing organelles (hydrogenosomes), which occur in anaerobic protozoa scattered throughout the eukaryotic tree. Hydrogenases also play a central role in the hydrogen and syntrophic hypotheses for eukaryogenesis. Here, we show that sequences related to iron-only hydrogenases ([Fe] hydrogenases) are more widely distributed among eukaryotes than reports of hydrogen production have suggested. Genes encoding small proteins which contain conserved structural features unique to [Fe] hydrogenases were identified on all well-surveyed aerobic eukaryote genomes. Longer sequences encoding [Fe] hydrogenases also occur in the anaerobic eukaryotes Entamoeba histolytica and Spironucleus barkhanus, both of which lack hydrogenosomes. We also identified a new [Fe] hydrogenase sequence from Trichomonas vaginalis, bringing the total of [Fe] hydrogenases reported for this organism to three, all of which may function within its hydrogenosomes. Phylogenetic analysis and hypothesis testing using likelihood ratio tests and parametric bootstrapping suggest that the [Fe] hydrogenases in anaerobic eukaryotes are not monophyletic. Iron-only hydrogenases from Entamoeba, Spironucleus, and Trichomonas are plausibly monophyletic, consistent with the hypothesis that a gene for [Fe] hydrogenase was already present on the genome of the common, perhaps also anaerobic, ancestor of these phylogenetically distinct eukaryotes. Trees where the [Fe] hydrogenase from the hydrogenosomal ciliate Nyctotherus was constrained to be monophyletic with the other eukaryote sequences were rejected using a likelihood ratio test of monophyly. In most analyses, the Nyctotherus sequence formed a sister group with a [Fe] hydrogenase on the genome of the eubacterium Desulfovibrio vulgaris. Thus, it is possible that Nyctotherus obtained its hydrogenosomal [Fe] hydrogenase from a different source from Trichomonas for its hydrogenosomes. We find no support for the hypothesis that components of the Nyctotherus [Fe] hydrogenase fusion protein derive from the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

N2  - Study of the nucleotide composition in Drosophila, focusing on the saltans and willistoni groups, has revealed unanticipated differences in nucleotide composition among lineages. Compositional differences are associated with an accelerated rate of nucleotide substitution in functionally less constrained regions. These observations have been set forth against the extended opinion that the pattern of point mutation has remained constant during the evolution of the genus. A crucial assumption has been that the most recent common ancestor of the subgenus Sophophora had an elevated GC content. Until now, this assumption has been supported by indirect arguments, consisting of extrapolations from closely related outgroups and limited by the robustness of mathematical descriptions concerning the extensive nucleotide composition differences among sequences. The present study seeks to test the assumption of a high ancestral GC content using realistic representations of the nucleotide substitution process to account for potential biases induced by the heterogeneous GC content of the taxa. The analysis of eight nuclear genes unambiguously corroborates that the common ancestor of Sophophora had an elevated GC content.

N2  - Evolutionary relationships among members of the regulator of complement activation (RCA) gene cluster were analyzed using neighbor-joining and parsimony methods of phylogenetic tree inference. We investigated the structural and functional similarities among short consensus repeats (SCRs) of the following human proteins: the α chain of the C4b-binding protein (C4bpα), factor H (FH), factor H-related proteins (FHR-1 through FHR-4), complement receptors type 1 (CR1) and type 2 (CR2), the CR1-like protein (CR1L), membrane cofactor protein (MCP), decay accelerating factor (DAF), and the sand bass proteins, the cofactor protein (SBP1) and its homolog, the cofactor-related protein (SBCRP-1). Also included are the β chain of the human C4b-binding protein (C4bpβ) and the b subunit of human blood-clotting factor XIII (FXIIIb). Our results indicate that the human plasma complement regulators, FH and C4bpα, fall into two distinct groups on the basis of their sequence divergence. Homology among RCA proteins is in agreement with their chromosomal location, with the exception of C4bpβ. The evolutionary relationships among individual short consensus repeats are confirmed by the exon/intron structure of the RCA members. Structural similarities among repeats of the RCA proteins correlate with their functional activities and demonstrate the importance of the N-terminal SCRs.

N2  - Cryptophytes are photosynthetic protists that have acquired their plastids through the secondary symbiotic uptake of a red alga. A remarkable feature of cryptophytes is that they maintain a reduced form of the red algal nucleus, the nucleomorph, between the second and third plastid membranes (periplastidial compartment; PC). The nucleomorph is thought to be a transition state in the evolution of secondary plastids, with this genome ultimately being lost when photosynthesis comes under full control of the "host" nucleus (e.g., as in heterokonts, haptophytes, and euglenophytes). Genes presently found in the nucleomorph seem to be restricted to those involved in its own maintenance and to that of the plastid; other genes were lost as the endosymbiont was progressively reduced to its present state. Surprisingly, we found that the cryptophyte Pyrenomonas helgolandii possesses a novel type of actin gene that originated from the nucleomorph genome of the symbiont. Our results demonstrate for the first time that secondary symbionts can contribute genes to the host lineage which are unrelated to plastid function. These genes are akin to the products of gene duplication or lateral transfer and provide a source of evolutionary novelty that can significantly increase the genetic diversity of the host lineage. We postulate that this may be a common phenomenon in algae containing secondary plastids that has yet to be fully appreciated due to a dearth of evolutionary studies of nuclear genes in these taxa.

N2  - Lamprin is a unique structural protein which forms the extracellular matrix of several cartilaginous structures found in the lamprey. Lamprin is noncollagenous in nature but shows sequence similarities to elastins and to insect structural proteins. Here, we characterize the structure and organization of lamprin genes, demonstrating the presence of multiple similar but not identical copies of the lamprin gene in the genome of the lamprey. In at least one species of lamprey, Lampetra richardsoni, the multiple gene copies are arranged in tandem in the genome in a head-to-tail orientation. Lamprin genes from Petromyzon marinus contain either seven or eight exons, with exon 4 being alternatively spliced in all genes, resulting in a total of six different lamprin transcripts. All exon junctions are of class 1,1. An unusual feature of the lamprin gene structure is the distribution of the 3' untranslated region sequence among multiple exons. A TATA box and cap sequence have been identified in upstream sequences in close proximity to the transcription start site, but no CAAT box could be identified. Sequence and gene structure comparisons between lamprins, elastins, and insect structural proteins suggest that the regions of sequence similarity are the result of a process of convergent evolution.

N2  - The remarkable conservation of protein structure, compared with that of sequences, suggests that in the course of evolution, residue substitutions which tend to destabilize a particular structure must be compensated by other substitutions that confer greater stability on that structure. Several approaches have been designed to detect correlated changes in a set of homologous sequences. However, most of them do not take into account the phylogeny of the sequences, and it has been shown that their detection power is weak. It remains unclear whether coevolution could be a general process at the level of amino acids of proteins. In the present study, we analyze the phylogenetic reconstruction of 15 sets of homologous proteins to assess, under different conditions, whether a significant amount of coevolving sites can be detected. Two criteria are used to detect significantly cosubstituting sites. One criterion corresponds to that of Shindyalov, Kolchanov, and Sander. The second one is based on intensive simulations of evolution of protein sequences along a phylogeny to estimate the significance of the number of observed cosubstitutions for pairs of sites. Our results show an important sensitivity of the detection of cosubstituting sites to the model used for the phylogenetic reconstruction. Not considering the uncertainty associated with the reconstructed data might lead to detecting numerous false-positive pairs of sites. Finally, significant amounts of coevolving pairs could be found only when substitutions affecting the physicochemical properties of the amino acids were considered. Such results suggest evidence of a cosubstitution mechanism in protein evolution. However, the identification of nonambiguous coevolving sites is still unresolved.

N2  - The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the chytridiomycete fungus Allomyces macrogynus contains 81 G+C-rich sequence elements that are 26-79 bases long and can be folded into a unique secondary structure consisting of two stem-loops. At the primary sequence level, the conservation of these double-hairpin elements (DHEs) is variable, ranging from marginal to complete identity. Forty of these DHEs are inserted in intergenic regions, 35 in introns, and 6 in variable regions of rRNA genes. Ten DHEs are inserted into other DHE elements (twins); two even form triplets. A comparison of DHE sequences shows that loop regions contain more sequence variation than helical regions and that the latter often contain compensatory base changes. This suggests a functional importance of the DHE secondary structure. We further identified nine DHEs in a 4-kb region of Allomyces arbusculus, a close relative of A. macrogynus. Eight of these DHEs are highly similar in sequence (90%-100%) to those in A. macrogynus, but only five are inserted at the same positions as in A. macrogynus. Interestingly, DHEs are also found in the mtDNAs of other chytridiomycetes, as well as certain zygomycete and ascomycete fungi. The overall distribution pattern of DHEs in fungal mtDNAs suggests that they are mobile elements.

N2  - Comparative analysis is one of the most powerful methods available for understanding the diverse and complex systems found in biology, but it is often limited by a lack of comprehensive taxonomic sampling. Despite the recent development of powerful genome technologies capable of producing sequence data in large quantities (witness the recently completed first draft of the human genome), there has been relatively little change in how evolutionary studies are conducted. The application of genomic methods to evolutionary biology is a challenge, in part because gene segments from different organisms are manipulated separately, requiring individual purification, cloning, and sequencing. We suggest that a feasible approach to collecting genome-scale data sets for evolutionary biology (i.e., evolutionary genomics) may consist of combination of DNA samples prior to cloning and sequencing, followed by computational reconstruction of the original sequences. This approach will allow the full benefit of automated protocols developed by genome projects to be realized; taxon sampling levels can easily increase to thousands for targeted genomes and genomic regions. Sequence diversity at this level will dramatically improve the quality and accuracy of phylogenetic inference, as well as the accuracy and resolution of comparative evolutionary studies. In particular, it will be possible to make accurate estimates of normal evolution in the context of constant structural and functional constraints (i.e., site-specific substitution probabilities), along with accurate estimates of changes in evolutionary patterns, including pairwise coevolution between sites, adaptive bursts, and changes in selective constraints. These estimates can then be used to understand and predict the effects of protein structure and function on sequence evolution and to predict unknown details of protein structure, function, and functional divergence. In order to demonstrate the practicality of these ideas and the potential benefit for functional genomic analysis, we describe a pilot project we are conducting to simultaneously sequence large numbers of vertebrate mitochondrial genomes.

N2  - A few nucleotide sites of nuclear exons that flank introns are often conserved. A hypothesis has suggested that these sites, called "proto-splice sites," are remnants of recognition signals for the insertion of introns in the early evolution of eukaryotic genes. This notion of proto-splice sites has been an important basis for the insertional theory of introns. This hypothesis predicts that the distribution of proto-splice sites would determine the distribution of intron phases, because the positions of introns are just a subset of the proto-splice sites. We previously tested this prediction by examining the proportions of the phases of proto-splice sites, revealing nothing in these proportion distributions similar to observed proportions of intron phases. Here, we provide a second independent test of the proto-splice site hypothesis, with regard to its prediction that the proto-splice sites would mimic intron phase correlations, using a CDS database we created from GenBank. We tested four hypothetical proto-splice sites G | G, AG | G, AG | GT, and C/AAG | R. Interestingly, while G | G and AG | GT site phase distributions are not consistent with actual introns, we observed that AG | G and C/AAG | R sites have a symmetric phase excess. However, the patterns of the excess are quite different from the actual intron phase distribution. In addition, particular amino acid repeats in proteins were found to partially contribute to the excess of symmetry at these two types of sites. The phase associations of all four sites are significantly different from those of intron phases. Furthermore, a general model of intron insertion into proto-splice sites was simulated by Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the probability that the random insertion of introns into AG | G and C/AAG | R sites could generate the observed intron phase distribution. The simulation showed that (1) no observed correlation of intron phases was statistically consistent with the phase distribution of proto-splice sites in the simulated virtual genes; (2) most conservatively, no simulation in 10,000 Monte Carlo experiments gave a pattern with an excess of symmetric (1, 1) exons larger than those of (0, 0) and (2, 2), a major statistical feature of intron phase distribution that is consistent with the directly observed cases of exon shuffling. Thus, these results reject the null hypothesis that introns are randomly inserted into preexisting proto-splice sites, as suggested by the insertional theory of introns.

N2  - We sequenced part of the mitochondrial control region and the cytochrome b gene in 72 specimens from 32 gull species (Laridae, Larini) and 2 outgroup representatives (terns: Laridae, Sternini). Our control region segment spanned the conserved central domain II and the usually hypervariable 3' domain III. Apart from some heteroplasmy at the 3' end of the control region, domain III was not more variable than domain II or the cytochrome b gene. Furthermore, variation in the tempo of evolution of domain III was apparent between phyletic species groups. The lack of variation of the gull control region could not be explained by an increase in the proportion of conserved sequences in these birds, and the gull control region showed an organization similar to those of other avian control regions studied to date. A novel invariant direct repeat was identified in domain II of gulls, and in domain III, two to three inverted, sometimes imperfect, repeats are able to form a significantly stable stem-and-loop structure. These putative secondary structures have not been reported before, and a comparison between species groups showed that they are more stable in the group with the more conserved control region. The unusually slow rate of evolution of control region part III of the gulls could thus be partly explained by the existence of secondary structures in domain III of these species.

N2  - Reconstruction of evolutionary relationships from noncontemporaneous molecular samples provides a new challenge for phylogenetic reconstruction methods. With recent biotechnological advances there has been an increase in molecular sequencing throughput, and the potential to obtain serial samples of sequences from populations, including rapidly evolving pathogens, is fast being realized. A new method called the serial-sample unweighted pair grouping method with arithmetic means (sUPGMA) is presented that reconstructs a genealogy or phylogeny of sequences sampled serially in time using a matrix of pairwise distances. The resulting tree depicts the terminal lineages of each sample ending at a different level consistent with the sample's temporal order. Since sUPGMA is a variant of UPGMA, it will perform best when sequences have evolved at a constant rate (i.e., according to a molecular clock). On simulated data, this new method performs better than standard cluster analysis under a variety of longitudinal sampling strategies. Serial-sample UPGMA is particularly useful for analysis of longitudinal samples of viruses and bacteria, as well as ancient DNA samples, with the minimal requirement that samples of sequences be ordered in time.

N2  - Clines in intraspecific genetic variation are frequently associated with an environmental transition. Here, divergence among nucleotide sequences of two nuclear loci, cytosolic and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (cMDH and mMDH, respectively), is described, in a multitrait cline over a distance of ca. 3 km where shell phenotype, allozyme, mitochondrial DNA haplotype, and centric fusion (Robertsonian translocations) frequencies covary with temperature and humidity and change abruptly in a continuous population of the dog-whelk (Nucella lapillus), a common intertidal snail of the north temperate Atlantic. Protein electrophoresis has already shown two alleles of mMDH varying from fixation of one allele to near fixation of the other, whereas cMDH appears to be monomorphic. The results of this study show a striking disparity in nucleotide sequence divergence among alleles at the two loci, with extreme molecular differentiation in one of them. Four alleles of cMDH were found to have nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergences of 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. In contrast, the two mMDH cDNA alleles differed by 23% and 20% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Analysis of a 91-bp partial nucleotide sequence of mMDH from Nucella freycineti, the closest relative of N. lapillus, revealed two similar alleles and indicated that the divergence in mMDH in N. lapillus represents an ancient transpecific polymorphism in these Nucella. Together with earlier studies on variation in N. lapillus, it is argued that the polymorphism in mMDH and the clines in N. lapillus represent the presence of two persistent coadapted gene complexes, multitrait coevolving genetic solutions to environmental variation, which may presently enable this snail to exploit a diverse environment successfully.

N2  - We describe a previously unrecognized form of gene homology using the term "gametology," which we define as homology arising through lack of recombination and subsequent differentiation of sex chromosomes. We demonstrate use of gametologous genes to root each other in phylogenetic analyses of sex-specific avian Chromo-helicase-DNA binding gene (CHD) sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of a set of neognath bird sequences yield monophyletic groups for CHD-W and CHD-Z gametologs, as well as congruent relationships between these two clades and between them and current views of avian taxonomy. Phylogenetic analyses including paleognath bird CHD sequences and rooting with crocodilian CHD sequences, suggest an early divergence for paleognath CHD within the avian CHD clade. Based on our CHD analyses calibrated with avian fossil dates, we estimate the divergence between CHD-W and CHD-Z at 123 MYA, suggesting an early differentiation of sex chromosomes that predates most extant avian orders. In agreement with the notion of male-driven evolution, we find a faster rate of change in male-linked CHD-Z sequences.

N2  - Sequencing of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear and mitochondrial genomes provided a new background for studies on the evolution of the genomes. In this study, mitochondrial genomes of a number of Saccharomyces yeasts were mapped by restriction enzyme analysis, the orders of the genes were determined, and two of the genes were sequenced. The genome organization, i.e., the size, presence of intergenic sequences, and gene order, as well as polymorphism within the coding regions, indicate that Saccharomyces mtDNA molecules are dynamic structures and have undergone numerous changes during their evolution. Since the separation and sexual isolation of different yeast lineages, the coding parts have been accumulating point mutations, presumably in a linear manner with the passage of time. However, the accumulation of other changes may not have been a simple function of time. Larger mtDNA molecules belonging to Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts have acquired extensive intergenic sequences, including guanosine-cytosine-rich clusters, and apparently have rearranged the gene order at higher rates than smaller mtDNAs belonging to the Saccharomyces sensu lato yeasts. While within the sensu stricto group transposition has been a predominant mechanism for the creation of novel gene orders, the sensu lato yeasts could have used both transposition- and inversion-based mechanisms.

N2  - Finding correct species relationships using phylogeny reconstruction based on molecular data is dependent on several empirical and technical factors. These include the choice of DNA sequence from which phylogeny is to be inferred, the establishment of character homology within a sequence alignment, and the phylogeny algorithm used. Nevertheless, sequencing and phylogeny tools provide a way of testing certain hypotheses regarding the relationship among the organisms for which phenotypic characters demonstrate conflicting evolutionary information. The protozoan family Sarcocystidae is one such group for which molecular data have been applied phylogenetically to resolve questionable relationships. However, analyses carried out to date, particularly based on small-subunit ribosomal DNA, have not resolved all of the relationships within this family. Analysis of more than one gene is necessary in order to obtain a robust species signal, and some DNA sequences may not be appropriate in terms of their phylogenetic information content. With this in mind, we tested the informativeness of our chosen molecule, the large-subunit ribosomal DNA (lsu rDNA), by using subdivisions of the sequence in phylogenetic analysis through PAUP, fastDNAml, and neighbor joining. The segments of sequence applied correspond to areas of higher nucleotide variation in a secondary-structure alignment involving 21 taxa. We found that subdivision of the entire lsu rDNA is inappropriate for phylogenetic analysis of the Sarcocystidae. There are limited informative nucleotide sites in the lsu rDNA for certain clades, such as the one encompassing the subfamily Toxoplasmatinae. Consequently, the removal of any segment of the alignment compromises the final tree topology. We also tested the effect of using two different alignment procedures (CLUSTAL W and the structure alignment using DCSE) and three different tree-building methods on the final tree topology. This work shows that congruence between different methods in the formation of clades may be a feature of robust topology; however, a sequence alignment based on primary structure may not be comparing homologous nucleotides even though the expected topology is obtained. Our results support previous findings showing the paraphyly of the current genera Sarcocystis and Hammondia and again bring to question the relationships of Sarcocystis muris, Isospora felis, and Neospora caninum. In addition, results based on phylogenetic analysis of the structure alignment suggest that Sarcocystis zamani and Sarcocystis singaporensis, which have reptilian definitive hosts, are monophyletic with Sarcocystis species using mammalian definitive hosts if the genus Frenkelia is synonymized with Sarcocystis.

N2  - Assessment of the evolutionary process is crucial for understanding the effect of protein structure and function on sequence evolution and for many other analyses in molecular evolution. Here, we used simulations to study how taxon sampling affects accuracy of parameter estimation and topological inference in the absence of branch length asymmetry. With maximum-likelihood analysis, we find that adding taxa dramatically improves both support for the evolutionary model and accurate assessment of its parameters when compared with increasing the sequence length. Using a method we call "doppelganger trees," we distinguish the contributions of two sources of improved topological inference: greater knowledge about internal nodes and greater knowledge of site-specific rate parameters. Surprisingly, highly significant support for the correct general model does not lead directly to improved topological inference. Instead, substantial improvement occurs only with accurate assessment of the evolutionary process at individual sites. Although these results are based on a simplified model of the evolutionary process, they indicate that in general, assuming processes are not independent and identically distributed among sites, more extensive sampling of taxonomic biodiversity will greatly improve analytical results in many current sequence data sets with moderate sequence lengths.

N2  - We present results concerning the power to detect past population growth using three microsatellite-based statistics available in the current literature: (1) that based on between-locus variability, (2) that based on the shape of allele size distribution, and (3) that based on the imbalance between variance and heterozygosity at a locus. The analysis is based on the single-step stepwise mutation model. The power of the statistics is evaluated for constant, as well as variable, mutation rates across loci. The latter case is important, since it is a standard procedure to pool data collected at a number of loci, and mutation rates at microsatellite loci are known to be different. Our analysis indicates that the statistic based on the imbalance between allele size variance and heterozygosity at a locus has the highest power for detection of population growth, particularly when mutation rates vary across loci.

N2  - One of the traditional enigmas in freshwater zoogeography has been the evolutionary origin of Scleropages formosus inhabiting Southeast Asia (the Asian arowana), which is a species threatened with extinction among the highly freshwater-adapted fishes from the order Osteoglossiformes. Dispersalists have hypothesized that it originated from the recent (the Miocene or later) transmarine dispersal of morphologically quite similar Australasian arowanas across Wallace's Line, but this hypothesis has been questioned due to their remarkable adaptation to freshwater. We determined the complete nucleotide sequences of two mitochondrial protein genes from 12 osteoglossiform species, including all members of the suborder Osteoglossoidei, with which robust molecular phylogeny was constructed and divergence times were estimated. In agreement with previous morphology-based phylogenetic studies, our molecular phylogeny suggested that the osteoglossiforms diverged from a basal position of the teleostean lineage, that heterotidines (the Nile arowana and the pirarucu) form a sister group of osteoglossines (arowanas in South America, Australasia, and Southeast Asia), and that the Asian arowana is more closely related to Australasian arowanas than to South American ones. However, molecular distances between the Asian and Australasian arowanas were much larger than expected from the fact that they are classified within the same genus. By using the molecular clock of bony fishes, tested for its good performance for rather deep divergences and calibrated using some reasonable assumptions, the divergence between the Asian and Australasian arowanas was estimated to date back to the early Cretaceous. Based on the molecular and geological evidence, we propose a new model whereby the Asian arowana vicariantly diverged from the Australasian arowanas in the eastern margin of Gondwanaland and migrated into Eurasia on the Indian subcontinent or smaller continental blocks. This study also implicates the relatively long absence of osteoglossiform fossil records from the Mesozoic.

There is a fast algorithm for obtaining the classification. A bootstrap test of a classification is also presented. As an example, we classified opsin genes. The classification obtained by this method is the same as the previous classification based on the function of opsins.

N2  - A widely held view of land plant relationships places liverworts as the first branch of the land plant tree, whereas some molecular analyses and a cladistic study of morphological characters indicate that hornworts are the earliest land plants. To help resolve this conflict, we used parsimony and likelihood methods to analyze a 6,095-character data set composed of four genes (chloroplast rbcL and small-subunit rDNA from all three plant genomes) from all major land plant lineages. In all analyses, significant support was obtained for the monophyly of vascular plants, lycophytes, ferns (including Psilotum and Equisetum), seed plants, and angiosperms. Relationships among the three bryophyte lineages were unresolved in parsimony analyses in which all positions were included and weighted equally. However, in parsimony and likelihood analyses in which rbcL third-codon-position transitions were either excluded or downweighted (due to apparent saturation), hornworts were placed as sister to all other land plants, with mosses and liverworts jointly forming the second deepest lineage. Decay analyses and Kishino-Hasegawa tests of the third-position-excluded data set showed significant support for the hornwort-basal topology over several alternative topologies, including the commonly cited liverwort-basal topology. Among the four genes used, mitochondrial small-subunit rDNA showed the lowest homoplasy and alone recovered essentially the same topology as the multigene tree. This molecular phylogeny presents new opportunities to assess paleontological evidence and morphological innovations that occurred during the early evolution of terrestrial plants.

N2  - The Wnt gene family is large, and new members are still being discovered. We constructed a parsimony tree for the Wnt family based on all 82 of the full-length sequences currently available. The inclusion of sequences from the cephalochordate amphioxus is especially useful in comprehensive gene trees, because the amphioxus genes in each subfamily often mark the base of the vertebrate diversification. We thus isolated full-length cDNAs of five amphioxus Wnt genes (AmphiWnt1, AmphiWnt4, AmphiWnt7, AmphiWnt8, and AmphiWnt11) for addition to the overall Wnt family tree. The analysis combined amino acid and nucleotide sequences (excluding third codon positions), taking into account 97% of the available data for each sequence. This combinatorial method had the advantage of generating a single most-parsimonious tree that was trichotomy-free. The reliability of the nodes was assessed by both jackknifing and Bremer support (decay index). A regression analysis revealed that branch length was strongly correlated with branch support, and possible reasons for this pattern are discussed. The tree topology suggested that in amphioxus, at least an AmphiWnt5 and an AmphiWnt10 have yet to be discovered.

N2  - Silks are highly expressed, secreted proteins that represent a substantial metabolic cost to the insects and spiders that produce them. Female spiders in the superfamily Araneoidea (the orb-spinning spiders and their close relatives) spin six different kinds of silk (three fibroins and three fibrous protein glues) that differ in amino acid content and protein structure. In addition to this diversity in silks produced by different glands, we found that individual spiders of the same species can spin dragline silks (drawn from the spider's ampullate gland) that vary in content as well. Freely foraging Argiope argentata (Araneae: Araneoidea), collected from 13 Caribbean islands, produced dragline silk that showed an inverse relationship between the amount of serine and glycine they contained. X-ray microdiffraction of the silks localized these differences to the amorphous regions of the protein that are thought to lend silks their elasticity. The crystalline regions of the proteins, which lend silks their strength, were unaffected. Laboratory experiments with Argiope keyserlingi suggested that variation in silk composition reflects the type of prey the spiders were fed but not the total amount of prey they received. Hence, it may be that the amino acid content (and perhaps the mechanical properties) of dragline silk spun by Argiope directly reflect the spiders' diet. The ability to vary silk composition and, possibly, function is particularly important for organisms that disperse broadly, such as Argiope, and that occupy diverse habitats with diverse populations of prey.

N2  - This paper describes a method for quantifying the extent to which a character supports a hypothesized monophyletic group. The basic idea was first proposed by Wilkinson in 1998; hence, we call it Wilkinson support. A character provides Wilkinson support if it could have changed state on the branch leading to the hypothesized monophyletic group without requiring any extra steps in an evolutionary tree. We describe a method to determine the exact probability that a character would provide Wilkinson support for a random group of the same size as the hypothesized monophyletic group. A character's weight is defined as the negative natural log of this probability. The sum over all characters of these weights in a data set is a measure of total weighted support. We exemplify this method using 30 Floricaula/LEAFY amino acid sequences. One copy of this gene occurs in angiosperms, but two copies occur in the other four seed plant groups. Angiosperms could have been primitively single-copy or could have lost either of the two paralogs. These possibilities correspond to three hypotheses of monophyly. We use total weighted Wilkinson support to evaluate these three hypotheses, and all three are shown to be significantly different from random as individual hypothesized monophyletic groups. Comparing these three hypotheses for total weighted support reveals that one has much more support than do the other two. This hypothesis favors the "mostly-male" theory of flowering-plant origins.

N2  - The extent of microsatellite size homoplasy, as well as its effect on several population genetics statistics, was investigated in natural populations using the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) method. The analysis was conducted using 240 individuals from 13 populations of the freshwater snail Bulinus truncatus at a GTnCTm compound microsatellite locus. We showed that SSCP can be used to uncover, at least partly, size homoplasy in the core sequence of this category of loci. Eight conformers (SSCP variants) were detected among the three size variants (electromorphs). Sequencing revealed that each conformer corresponded to a different combination of repeats in the GTn and CTm arrays. Part of this additional variability was detected within populations, resulting in a substantial increase in gene diversity in four populations. Additional variability also changed the values of parameters used to analyze population differentiation among populations: pairwise tests of differentiation were significant much more often with conformers than with electromorphs. On the other hand, pairwise estimates of Fst were either smaller or larger with conformers than with electromorphs, depending on whether or not electromorphs were shared among populations. However, estimates of Fst (or analogs) over all populations were very similar, ranging between 0.66 and 0.75. Our results were consistent with the theoretical prediction that homoplasy should not always lead to stronger population structure. Finally, conformer sequences and electromorph size distribution suggested that single-point and/or stepwise mutations occurring simultaneously in the different repeated arrays of compound microsatellites produce sequence variation without size variation and hence generate more size homoplasy than expected under a simple stepwise mutation model.

N2  - In a striking contrast, matK is one of the most rapidly evolving plastid genes and also one of the few plastid genes to be retained in all nonphotosynthetic plants examined to date. DNA sequences of this region were obtained from photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic plants of Orobanchaceae and their relatives. The resulting plastid DNA phylogeny was congruent with that recently obtained from analyses of rps2 and provided much better resolution. This phylogeny was then used to examine the relative degrees of evolutionary constraint of both the matK gene and the non-protein-coding regions that flank it inside the trnK intron. The method of subtree contrasts was introduced to compare levels of constraint. matK has evolved with a low but significant level of constraint on its amino acid sequence in both photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic plants. Constraint is greater in photosynthetic than in nonphotosynthetic plants of this group. Domain X, thought to contain the active site of the protein, is not significantly more constrained than the rest of the protein. The portions of the flanking regions that are thought to form paired stem structures also show constraint, but in this case, there is no significant difference in degree of constraint between photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic plants.

T1  - Nucleotide Variation at the yellow Gene Region is not Reduced in Drosophila subobscura: A Study in Relation to Chromosomal Polymorphism

N2  - In contrast to Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans, the yellow (y) gene region of Drosophila subobscura is not located in a region with a strong reduction in recombination. In addition, this gene maps very close to the breakpoints of different inversions that segregate as polymorphic in natural populations of D. subobscura. Therefore, levels of variation at the y gene region in this species relative to those found in D. melanogaster and D. simulans may be affected not only by the change in the recombinational environment, but also by the presence of inversion polymorphism. To further investigate these aspects, an approximately 5.4-kb region of the A (=X) chromosome including the y gene was sequenced in 25 lines of D. subobscura and in the closely related species Drosophila madeirensis and Drosophila guanche. The D. subobscura lines studied differed in their A-chromosomal arrangements, Ast, A2, and A1. Unlike in D. melanogaster and D. simulans, levels of variation at the y gene region of D. subobscura are not reduced relative to those found at other genomic regions in the same species (rp49, Acp70A, and Acph-1). This result supports the effect of the change in the recombinational environment of a particular gene on the level of neutral variation. In addition, nucleotide variation is affected by chromosomal polymorphism. A strong genetic differentiation is detected between the A1 arrangement and either Ast or A2, but not between Ast and A2. This result is consistent with the location of the y gene relative to the breakpoints of inversions A1 and A2. In addition, the pattern of nucleotide polymorphism in Ast+A2 and A1 seems to point out that variation at the y gene region within these chromosomal classes is in the phase transient to equilibrium. The estimated ages of these arrangements assuming a star genealogy indicate that their origin cannot predate the D. madeirensis split. Therefore, the present results are consistent with a chromosomal phylogeny where Am1, which is an arrangement present in D. madeirensis but absent in current populations of D. subobscura, would be the ancestral arrangement.

N2  - Two-component signal transduction (TCST) systems are the principal means for coordinating responses to environmental changes in bacteria as well as some plants, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. These systems typically consist of a receptor histidine kinase, which reacts to an extracellular signal by phosphorylating a cytoplasmic response regulator, causing a change in cellular behavior. Although several model systems, including sporulation and chemotaxis, have been extensively studied, the evolutionary relationships between specific TCST systems are not well understood, and the ancestry of the signal transduction components is unclear. Phylogenetic trees of TCST components from 14 complete and 6 partial genomes, containing 183 histidine kinases and 220 response regulators, were constructed using distance methods. The trees showed extensive congruence in the positions of 11 recognizable phylogenetic clusters. Eukaryotic sequences were found almost exclusively in one cluster, which also showed the greatest extent of domain variability in its component proteins, and archaeal sequences mainly formed species-specific clusters. Three clusters in different parts of the kinase tree contained proteins with serine-phosphorylating activity. All kinases were found to be monophyletic with respect to other members of their superfamily, such as type II topoisomerases and Hsp90. Structural analysis further revealed significant similarity to the ATP-binding domain of eukaryotic protein kinases. TCST systems are of bacterial origin and radiated into archaea and eukaryotes by lateral gene transfer. Their components show extensive coevolution, suggesting that recombination has not been a major factor in their differentiation. Although histidine kinase activity is prevalent, serine kinases have evolved multiple times independently within this family, accompanied by a loss of the cognate response regulator(s). The structural and functional similarity between TCST kinases and eukaryotic protein kinases raises the possibility of a distant evolutionary relationship.

T1  - Widespread Occurrence of Spliceosomal Introns in the rDNA Genes of Ascomycetes

N2  - Spliceosomal (pre-mRNA) introns have previously been found in eukaryotic protein-coding genes, in the small nuclear RNAs of some fungi, and in the small- and large-subunit ribosomal DNA genes of a limited number of ascomycetes. How the majority of these introns originate remains an open question because few proven cases of recent and pervasive intron origin have been documented. We report here the widespread occurrence of spliceosomal introns (69 introns at 27 different sites) in the small- and large-subunit nuclear-encoded rDNA of lichen-forming and free-living members of the Ascomycota. Our analyses suggest that these spliceosomal introns are of relatively recent origin, i.e., within the Euascomycetes, and have arisen through aberrant reverse-splicing (in trans) of free pre-mRNA introns into rRNAs. The spliceosome itself, and not an external agent (e.g., transposable elements, group II introns), may have given rise to these introns. A nonrandom sequence pattern was found at sites flanking the rRNA spliceosomal introns. This pattern (AG-intron-G) closely resembles the proto-splice site (MAG-intron-R) postulated for intron insertions in pre-mRNA genes. The clustered positions of spliceosomal introns on secondary structures suggest that particular rRNA regions are preferred sites for insertion through reverse-splicing.

N2  - The FAH1 and F3H genes encode ferulate-5-hydroxylase and flavanone-3-hydroxylase, which are enzymes in the pathways leading to the synthesis of sinapic acid esters and flavonoids, respectively. Nucleotide variation at these genes was surveyed by sequencing a sample of 20 worldwide Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes and one Arabidopsis lyrata spp. petraea stock. In contrast with most previously studied genes, the percentage of singletons was rather low in both the FAH1 and the F3H gene regions. There was, therefore, no footprint of a recent species expansion in the pattern of nucleotide variation in these regions. In both FAH1 and F3H, nucleotide variation was structured into two major highly differentiated haplotypes. In both genes, there was a peak of silent polymorphism in the 5' part of the coding region without a parallel increase in silent divergence. In FAH1, the peak was centered at the beginning of the second exon. In F3H, nucleotide diversity was highest at the beginning of the gene. The observed pattern of variation in both FAH1 and F3H, although suggestive of balancing selection, was compatible with a neutral model with no recombination.

N2  - We present sequence data from two genomic regions of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) subjected to several experimental passage regimens. Maximum-likelihood estimates of the nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratio parameter (dN/dS) suggested the action of positive selection on some antigenic sites of the FMDV capsid during some experimental passages. These antigenic sites showed an accumulation of convergent amino acid replacements during massive serial cytolytic passages and also in persistent infections of FMDV in cell culture. This accumulation was most significant at the antigenic site A (the G-H loop of capsid VP1), which includes an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) cellular recognition motif. Our analyses also identified a subregion of VP3, part of the fivefold axis of FMDV particles, that also appeared to be subjected to positive selection of amino acid replacements. From these results, we can conclude that under the restrictive conditions imposed either by the presence of the monoclonal antibodies, by the persistent infections, or by the competition processes established between different variants of the viral population, amino acid replacement in some capsid-coding regions can be positively selected toward an increase of those mutants with a higher capability to infect the cell.

N2  - Many genes pertaining to male reproductive functions have been shown to evolve rapidly between species, and evidence increasingly suggest the influence of positive Darwinian selection. The accessory gland protein gene (Acp26Aa) of Drosophila is one such example. In order to understand the mechanism of selection, it is often helpful to examine the pattern of polymorphism. We report here that the level of amino acid polymorphism in the N-terminal quarter of Acp26Aa is high in Drosophila melanogaster and is unprecedented in its sibling species Drosophila mauritiana. We postulate that (1) this N-terminal segment may play a role in sperm competition, and (2) D. mauritiana may have been under much more intense sexual selection than other species. Both postulates have important ramifications and deserve to be tested rigorously.

N2  - The phylogeny of Anisoptera, dragonflies in the strict sense, has proven to be notoriously difficult to resolve. Based on morphological characters, several recent publications dealing with the phylogeny of dragonflies proposed contradicting inter- and intrafamily relationships. We explored phylogenetic information content of mitochondrial large-subunit (LSU) and small-subunit (SSU) ribosomal gene fragments for these systematic problems. Starting at published universal primers, we developed primer sets suitable for amplifying large parts of the LSU and SSU rRNA genes within dragonflies. These fragments turned out to harbor sufficient phylogenetic information to satisfyingly resolve intrafamily relationships, but they contain insufficient phylogenetic structure to permit reliable conclusions about several interfamily relationships. We demonstrate that decay of phylogenetic signal progresses from intrafamily to interfamily to outgroup relationships and is correlated with an increase of genetic distances. As expected, signal decay is most pronounced in fast-changing sites. Additionally, base composition among fast-changing sites significantly deviates from the expected homogeneity. Homogeneity of base composition among all included taxa was restored only after removing fast-changing sites from the data set. The molecular data tentatively support interfamily relationships proposed by the most recent publication based on morphological characters of fossil and extant dragonflies.

N2  - We provide a comprehensive analysis of the current enzymes with α-amylase activity (AAMYs) that belong to family 13 glycoside hydrolase (GH-13; 144 Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota sequences from 87 different species). This study aims to further knowledge of the evolutionary molecular relationships among the sequences of their A and B domains with special emphasis on the correlation between what is observed in the structures and protein evolution. Multialignments for the A domain distinguish two clusters for sequences from Archaea organisms, eight for sequences from Bacteria organisms, and three for sequences from Eukaryota organisms. The clusters for Bacteria do not follow any strict taxonomic pathway; in fact, they are rather scattered. When we compared the A domains of sequences belonging to different kingdoms, we found that various pairs of clusters were significantly similar. Using either sequence similarity with crystallized structures or secondary-structure prediction methods, we identified in all AAMYs the eight putative β-strands that constitute the β-sheet in the TIM barrel of the A domain and studied the packing in its interior. We also discovered a "hidden homology" in the TIM barrel, an invariant Gly located upstream in the sequence before the conserved Asp in β-strand 3. This Gly precedes an α-helix and is actively involved in capping its N-terminal end with a capping box. In all cases, a Schellman motif caps the C-terminal end of this helix.

N2  - Unlike other mammals, Old World primates have five growth hormone-like genes that are highly divergent at the amino acid level from the single growth hormone genes found in nonprimates. Additionally, there is a change in the interaction of growth hormone with its receptor in humans such that human growth hormone functions in nonprimates, whereas nonprimate growth hormone is ineffective in humans. A Southern blotting analysis of the genome of a prosimian, Galago senegalensis, revealed a single growth hormone locus. This single gene was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and sequenced. It has a rate of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution less than one fourth that of the human growth hormone gene, while the rates of synonymous substitution in the two species are less different. Human and rhesus monkey growth hormones exhibit variation at a number of amino acid residues that can affect receptor binding. The galago growth hormone is conservative at each of these sites, indicating that this growth hormone is functionally like nonprimate growth hormones. These observations indicate that the amplification and rapid divergence of primate growth hormones occurred after the separation of the higher primate lineage from the galago lineage.

N2  - The complete nucleotide sequence of the mitochondrial genome of the crinoid Florometra serratissima has been determined. It is a circular DNA molecule, 16,005 bp in length, containing the genes for 13 proteins, small and large ribosomal RNAs, and 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs). Three regions of unassigned sequence (UAS) greater than 73 bp have been located. The largest, UAS I, is 432 bp long and exhibits sequence similarity to the putative mitochondrial control regions seen in other animals. UAS II (77 bp) and UAS III (73 bp) are located between the 5' ends of coding sequences and may play roles as bidirectional promoters. Analyses of nucleotide composition revealed that the major peptide-encoding strand is high in T and low in C. This bias is reflected in a specific pattern of codon usage. Molecular phylogenetic analyses based on cytochrome c oxidase (COI, COII, and COIII) amino acid and nucleotide sequences did not resolve all the relationships between echinoderm classes. The overall animal mitochondrial gene content has been maintained in the crinoid, but there is extensive rearrangement with respect to both the echinoid and the asteroid mtDNA gene maps. Florometra serratissima has a novel genome organization in a segment containing most of the tRNA genes, large and small rRNA genes, and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 and 2 genes. Potential pathways and mechanisms for gene rearrangements between mitochondrial gene maps of echinoderm classes and vertebrates are discussed as indicators of early deuterostome phylogeny.

N2  - SINEs are short interspersed repetitive elements found in many eukaryotic genomes and are believed to propagate by retroposition. Almost all SINEs reported to date have a composite structure made of a 5' tRNA-related region followed by a tRNA-unrelated region. Here, we describe a new type of tRNA-derived SINEs from the genome of the mosquito Culex pipiens. These elements, called Twins, are ~220 bp long and reiterated at approximately 500 copies per haploid genome. Twins have a unique structure compared with other tRNA-SINEs described so far. They consist of two tRNA-related regions separated by a 39-bp spacer. Other tRNA-unrelated sequences include a 5-bp leader preceding the left tRNA-like unit and a short trailer located downstream of the right tRNA-like region. This 3' trailer is a 10-bp sequence that is ended by a TTTT motif and followed by a polyA tract of variable length. The right tRNA-like unit also contains a 16-bp sequence which is absent in the left one and appears to be located in the ancestral anticodon stem precisely at a position expected for a nuclear tRNA intron. According to this singular structure, we hypothesize that the Twin SINE family originated from an unprocessed polymerase III transcript containing two tRNA sequences. We suggest that some peculiar properties acquired by this dicistronic transcript, such as a polyA tail and a 3' stem-loop secondary structure, promote its retroposition by increasing its chances of being recognized by a reverse transcriptase encoded elsewhere in the C. pipiens genome.

N2  - Jule is the second complete long-terminal-repeat (LTR) Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposon identified to date in vertebrates. Jule, first isolated from the poeciliid fish Xiphophorus maculatus, is 4.8 kb in length, is flanked by two 202-bp LTRs, and encodes Gag (structural core protein) and Pol (protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and integrase, in that order) but no envelope. There are three to four copies of Jule per haploid genome in X. maculatus. Two of them are located in a subtelomeric region of the sex chromosomes, where they are associated with the Xmrk receptor tyrosine kinase genes, of which oncogenic versions are responsible for the formation of hereditary melanoma in Xiphophorus. One almost intact copy of Jule was found in the first intron of the X-chromosomal allele of the Xmrk proto-oncogene, and a second, more corrupted copy is present only 56 nt downstream of the polyadenylation signal of the Xmrk oncogene. Jule-related elements were detected by Southern blot hybridization with less than 10 copies per haploid genome in numerous other poeciliids, as well as in more divergent fishes, including the medakafish Oryzias latipes and the tilapia Oreochromis niloticus. Database searches also identified Jule-related sequences in the zebrafish Danio rerio and in both genome project pufferfishes, Fugu rubripes and Tetraodon nigroviridis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Jule is the first member of the Mag family of Ty3/Gypsy retrotransposons described to date in vertebrates. This family includes the silkworm Mag and sea urchin SURL retrotransposons, as well as sequences from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Additional related elements were identified in the genomes of the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae and the nematode Ascaris lumbricoides. Phylogeny of Mag-related elements suggested that the Mag family of retrotransposons is polyphyletic and is constituted of several ancient lineages that diverged before their host genomes more than 600 MYA.

N2  - Quercus petraea and Quercus robur are two closely related oak species that frequently hybridize. We sequenced 70 clones containing the 5.8S and ITS2 regions of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from these two species and did not detect a species-specific difference. Surprisingly, three divergent (up to 12.6%) rDNA families were identified in both species, indicating that they predate the speciation event. Despite a large between-rDNA-families divergence, rDNA sequences were very similar within families, suggesting ongoing concerted evolution. Expression analysis, relative-rate tests, and mutation spectrum analyses indicated that only a single rDNA family is functional. We propose that past hybridization events, combined with nucleolar dominance, were the evolutionary processes underlying the contemporary rDNA variability in Q. petraea and Q. robur.

N2  - Hypervariability is a prominent feature of large gene families that mediate interactions between organisms, such as venom-derived toxins or immunoglobulins. In order to study mechanisms for evolution of hypervariability, we examined an EST-generated assemblage of 170 distinct conopeptide sequences from the venoms of five species of marine Conus snails. These sequences were assigned to eight gene families, defined by conserved elements in the signal domain and untranslated regions. Order-of-magnitude differences were observed in the expression levels of individual conopeptides, with five to seven transcripts typically comprising over 50% of the sequenced clones in a given species. The conopeptide precursor alignments revealed four striking features peculiar to the mature peptide domain: (1) an accelerated rate of nucleotide substitution, (2) a bias for transversions over transitions in nucleotide substitutions, (3) a position-specific conservation of cysteine codons within the hypervariable region, and (4) a preponderance of nonsynonymous substitutions over synonymous substitutions. We propose that the first three observations argue for a mutator mechanism targeted to mature domains in conopeptide genes, combining a protective activity specific for cysteine codons and a mutagenic polymerase that exhibits transversion bias, such as DNA polymerase V. The high Dn/Ds ratio is consistent with positive or diversifying selection, and further analyses by intraspecific/interspecific gene tree contingency tests weakly support recent diversifying selection in the evolution of conopeptides. Since only the most highly expressed transcripts segregate in gene trees according to the feeding specificity of the species, diversifying selection might be acting primarily on these sequences. The combination of a targeted mutator mechanism to generate high variability with the subsequent action of diversifying selection on highly expressed variants might explain both the hypervariability of conopeptides and the large number of unique sequences per species.

N2  - Both mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences have been employed in efforts to reconstruct deep-level phylogenetic relationships. A fundamental question in molecular systematics concerns the efficacy of different types of sequences in recovering clades at different taxonomic levels. We compared the performance of four mitochondrial data sets (cytochrome b, cytochrome oxidase II, NADH dehydrogenase subunit I, 12S rRNA-tRNA-16S rRNA) and eight nuclear data sets (exonic regions of α-2B adrenergic receptor, aquaporin, β-casein, γ-fibrinogen, interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, κ-casein, protamine, von Willebrand Factor) in recovering deep-level mammalian clades. We employed parsimony and minimum-evolution with a variety of distance corrections for superimposed substitutions. In 32 different pairwise comparisons between these mitochondrial and nuclear data sets, we used the maximum set of overlapping taxa. In each case, the variable-length bootstrap was used to resample at the size of the smaller data set. The nuclear exons consistently performed better than mitochondrial protein and rRNA-tRNA coding genes on a per-residue basis in recovering benchmark clades. We also concatenated nuclear genes for overlapping taxa and made comparisons with concatenated mitochondrial protein-coding genes from complete mitochondrial genomes. The variable-length bootstrap was used to score the recovery of benchmark clades as a function of the number of resampled base pairs. In every case, the nuclear concatenations were more efficient than the mitochondrial concatenations in recovering benchmark clades. Among genes included in our study, the nuclear genes were much less affected by superimposed substitutions. Nuclear genes having appropriate rates of substitution should receive strong consideration in efforts to reconstruct deep-level phylogenetic relationships.

T1  - Lake Level Fluctuations Synchronize Genetic Divergences of Cichlid Fishes in African Lakes

N2  - Water level fluctuations are important modulators of speciation processes in tropical lakes, in that they temporarily form or break down barriers to gene flow among adjacent populations and/or incipient species. Time estimates of the most recent major lowstands of the three African Great Lakes are thus crucial to infer the relative timescales of explosive speciation events in cichlid species flocks. Our approach combines geological evidence with genetic divergence data of cichlid fishes from the three Great East African Lakes derived from the fastest-evolving mtDNA segment. Thereby, we show for each of the three lakes that individuals sampled from several populations which are currently isolated by long geographic distances and/or deep water form clusters of equally closely related haplotypes. The distribution of identical or equally closely related haplotypes in a lake basin allows delineation of the extent of lake level fluctuations. Our data suggest that the same climatic phenomenon synchronized the onset of genetic divergence of lineages in all three species flocks, such that their most recent evolutionary history seems to be linked to the same external modulators of adaptive radiation. A calibration of the molecular clock of the control region was elaborated by gauging the age of the Lake Malawi species flock through the divergence among the utaka-cichlid and the mbuna-cichlid lineages to minimally 570,000 years and maximally 1 Myr. This suggests that the low-lake-level period which established the observed patterns of genetic relatedness dates back less than 57,000 years, probably even to 17,000-12,400 years ago, when Lake Victoria dried up and Lakes Malawi and Tanganyika were also low. A rapid rise of all three lakes about 11,000 years ago established the large-scale population subdivisions observed today. Over that period of time, a multitude of species originated in Lakes Malawi and Victoria with an impressive degree of morphological and ecological differentiation, whereas the Tanganyikan taxa that were exposed to the same habitat changes hardly diverged ecologically and morphologically. Our findings also show that patterns of genetic divergences of stenotopic organisms provide valuable feedback on geological and sedimentological time estimates for lake level changes.

N2  - A diverse collection of Ty1-copia group retrotransposons has been characterized from the genome of Picea abies (Norway spruce) by degenerate PCR amplification of a region of the reverse transcriptase gene. The occurrence of these retrotransposable elements in the gymnosperms was investigated by Southern blot hybridization analysis. The distribution of the different retrotransposons across the gymnosperms varies greatly. All of the retrotransposon clones isolated are highly conserved within the Picea (spruce) genus, many are also present in Pinus (pine) and/or Abies (fir) genera, and some share strongly homologous sequences with one or more of cedar, larch, Sequoia, cypress, and Ginkgo. Further subclones of one of the most strongly conserved retrotransposon sequences, Tpa28, were obtained from Ginkgo and P. abies. Comparisons of individual sequence pairs between the two species show nucleotide cross-homologies of around 80%-85%, corresponding to nucleotide substitution rates similar to those of nuclear protein-coding genes. Analysis of Tpa28 consensus sequences reveals that strong purifying selection has acted on this retrotransposon in the lineages connecting Ginkgo and Picea. Collectively, these data suggest, first, that the evolution of the Ty1-copia retrotransposon group in the gymnosperms is dominated by germ line vertical transmission, with strong selection for reverse transcriptase sequence, and, second, that extinction of individual retrotransposon types has been comparatively rare in gymnosperm species lineages compared with angiosperms. If this very high level of sequence conservation is a general property of the retrotransposons, then their extreme sequence diversity implies that they are extremely ancient, and the major element lineages seen today may have arisen early in eukaryote evolution. The data are also consistent with horizontal transmission of particular retrotransposons between species, but such a mechanism is unnecessary to explain the results.

N2  - To investigate the level and pattern of DNA polymorphism in the noncoding regulatory region in the plant nuclear genome, 2.4 kb of nucleotide sequence of the 5' upstream region of Adh was determined for 14 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana and five accessions of Arabis gemmifera. Using this data set and previously determined Adh sequence data, DNA variation was analyzed in a 4.4-kb region of the locus. Two divergent sequence types detected in the transcriptional unit of Adh were not present in the 5' region of the Adh gene in A. thaliana. Nucleotide diversity of the entire 5' region was estimated to be 0.0040, which is lower than that in the transcriptional unit. The level of variation was not uniform. There were peaks of variations in a ~400-bp region where cis-regulatory elements for Adh expression were clustered and in exon 4. In interspecific comparison with A. gemmifera, lower divergence was observed in the 5' flanking region than in the exons. High peaks of divergence in the 400-bp regulatory region and exon 4 were also detected, although there were many other peaks. These results indicate that regions of functional importance have a high level of polymorphism and divergence in the Adh locus of these genera. The possibility of balancing selection in the Adh gene of these plants is discussed.

N2  - In order to examine the possibility of multiple founding populations of anatomically modern Homo sapiens, we collected DNA sequence data from 10 X-chromosomal regions, 5 autosomal regions, and 1 Y-chromosomal region, in addition to mitochondrial DNA. Except for five regions which are genealogically uninformative and two other regions for which chimpanzee orthologs are not available, the ancestral sequence and population for each of the remaining regions were successfully inferred. Of these 10 ancestral sequences, 9 occurred in Africa and only 1 occurred in Asia during the Pleistocene. Computer simulation was carried out to quantify the multiregional hypothesis based solely on the premise that there was more than one founding population in the Pleistocene. Allowing the breeding size to vary among the founding populations, the hypothesis may account for the observed African ancestry in 90% of the genomic regions. However, it is required that the founding population in Africa was much larger than that outside Africa. Likelihood estimates of the breeding sizes in the founding populations were more than 9,000 in Africa and less than 1,000 in outside of Africa, although these estimates can be much less biased at the 1% significance level. If the number of African ancestral sequences further increases as more data accumulate in other genomic regions, the conclusion of a single founding population of modern H. sapiens is inevitable.

N2  - Arthropod hemocyanins are members of a protein superfamily that also comprises the arthropod phenoloxidases (tyrosinases), crustacean pseudohemocyanins (cryptocyanins), and insect storage hexamerins. The evolution of these proteins was inferred by neighbor-joining, maximum-parsimony, and maximum-likelihood methods. Monte Carlo shuffling approaches provided evidence against a discernible relationship of the arthropod hemocyanin superfamily and molluscan hemocyanins or nonarthropodan tyrosinases. Within the arthropod hemocyanin superfamily, the phenoloxidase probably emerged early in the (eu-)arthropod stemline and thus form the most likely outgroup. The respiratory hemocyanins evolved from these enzymes before the radiation of the extant euarthropodan subphyla. Due to different functional constraints, replacement rates greatly vary between the clades. Divergence times were thus estimated assuming local molecular clocks using several substitution models. The results were consistent and indicated the separation of the cheliceratan and crustacean hemocyanins close to 600 MYA. The different subunit types of the multihexameric cheliceratan hemocyanin have a rather conservative structure and diversified in the arachnidan stemline between 550 and 450 MYA. By contrast, the separation of the crustacean (malacostracan) hemocyanin subunits probably occurred only about 200 MYA. The nonrespiratory pseudohemocyanins evolved within the Decapoda about 215 MYA. The insect hemocyanins and storage hexamerins emerged independently from the crustacean hemocyanins. The time of divergence of the insect proteins from the malacostracan hemocyanins was estimated to be about 430-440 MYA, providing support for the notion that the Hexapoda evolved from the same crustacean lineage as the Malacostraca.

N2  - We have identified two novel, closely related subfamilies of non-long-terminal-repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons in Drosophila melanogaster, the Waldo-A and Waldo-B subfamilies, that are in the same lineage as site-specific LTR retrotransposons of the R1 clade. Both contain potentially active copies with two large open reading frames, having coding capacities for a nucleoprotein as well as endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. Many copies are truncated at the 5' end, and most are surrounded by target site duplications of variable lengths. Elements of both subfamilies have a nonrandom distribution in the genome, often being inserted within or very close to (CA)n arrays. At the DNA level, the longest elements of Waldo-A and Waldo-B are 69% identical on their entire length, except for the 5' untranslated regions, which have a mosaic organization, suggesting that one arose from the other following new promoter acquisition. This event occurred before the speciation of the D. melanogaster subgroup of species, since both Waldo-A and Waldo-B coexist in other species of this subgroup.

N2  - Molecular clocks can be calibrated using fossils within the group under study (internal calibration) or outside of the group (external calibration). Both types of calibration have their advantages and disadvantages. An internal calibration may reduce extrapolation error but may not be from the best fossil record, raising the issue of nonindependence. An external calibration may be more independent but also may have a greater extrapolation error. Here, we used the advantages of both methods by applying a sequential calibration to avian molecular clocks. We estimated a basal divergence within birds, the split between fowl (Galliformes) and ducks (Anseriformes), to be 89.8 ± 6.97 MYA using an external calibration and 12 rate-constant nuclear genes. In turn, this time estimate was used as an internal calibration for three species-rich avian molecular data sets: mtDNA, DNA-DNA hybridization, and transferrin immunological distances. The resulting time estimates indicate that many major clades of modern birds had their origins within the Cretaceous. This supports earlier studies that identified large gaps in the avian fossil record and suggests that modern birds may have coexisted with other avian lineages for an extended period during the Cretaceous. The new time estimates are concordant with a continental breakup model for the origin of ratites.

N2  - Human DNA variation is currently a subject of intense research because of its importance for studying human origins, evolution, and demographic history and for association studies of complex diseases. A ~10-kb region on chromosome 1, which contains only four small exons (each <155 bp), was sequenced for 61 humans (20 Africans, 20 Asians, and 21 Europeans) and for 1 chimpanzee, 1 gorilla, and 1 orangutan. We found 52 polymorphic sites among the 122 human sequences and 382 variant sites among the human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan sequences. For the introns sequenced (8,991 bp), the nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.058% among all sequences, 0.076% among the African sequences, 0.047% among the Asian sequences, and 0.045% among the European sequences. A compilation of data revealed that autosomal regions have, on average, the highest π value (0.091%), X-linked regions have a somewhat lower π value (0.079%), and Y-linked regions have a very low π value (0.008%). The lower polymorphism in the present region may be due to a lower mutation rate and/or selection in the gene containing these introns or in genes linked to this region. The present region and two other 10-kb noncoding regions all show a strong excess of low-frequency variants, indicating a relatively recent population expansion. This region has a low mutation rate, which was estimated to be 0.74 x 10 per nucleotide per year. An average estimate of ~12,600 for the long-term effective population size was obtained using various methods; the estimate was not far from the commonly used value of 10,000. Fu and Li's tests rejected the assumption of an equilibrium neutral Wright-Fisher population, largely owing to the high proportion of low-frequency variants. The age of the most recent common ancestor of the sequences in our sample was estimated to be more than 1 Myr. Allowing for some unrealistic assumptions in the model, this estimate would still suggest an age of more than 500,000 years, providing further evidence for a genetic history of humans much more ancient than the emergence of modern humans. The fact that many unique variants exist in Europe and Asia also suggests a fairly long genetic history outside of Africa and argues against a complete replacement of all indigenous populations in Europe and Asia by a small Africa stock. Moreover, the ancient genetic history of humans indicates no severe bottleneck during the evolution of humans in the last half million years; otherwise, much of the ancient genetic history would have been lost during a severe bottleneck. We suggest that both the "Out of Africa" and the multiregional models are too simple to explain the evolution of modern humans.

N2  - The statistical testing of alternative phylogenetic trees is central to evaluating competing evolutionary hypotheses. Fleming proposed that the New Zealand cicada species Maoricicada iolanthe is the sister species to the major radiation of both low-altitude and montane Maoricicada species. However, using 1,520 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence data from the cytochrome oxidase subunit I, tRNA aspartic acid, and the ATPase subunit 6 and 8 genes, we inferred that both M. iolanthe and another low-altitude species, Maoricicada campbelli, are nested within the montane Maoricicada radiation. Therefore, we examined the stability of the inferred phylogenetic placement of these two species using the newly developed Shimodaira-Hasegawa test (SH test) implemented in a maximum-likelihood framework. The SH test has two advantages over the more commonly used Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) and Templeton tests. First, the SH test simultaneously compares multiple topologies and corrects the corresponding P values to accommodate the multiplicity of testing. Second, the SH test is correct when applied to a posteriori hypotheses, unlike the KH test, because it readjusts the expectation of the null hypothesis (that two trees are not different) accordingly. The comparison of P values estimated under the assumptions of both the KH test and the SH test clearly demonstrate that the KH test has the potential to be misleading when the issue of comparing of a posteriori hypotheses is ignored and when multiple comparisons are not taken into account. The SH test, in combination with a variety of character-weighting schemes applied to our data, reveals a surprising amount of ambiguity in the phylogenetic placement of M. iolanthe and M. campbelli.

N2  - R1 non-long terminal repeat retrotransposable elements insert specifically into the 28S rRNA genes of arthropods. One aspect of R1 evolution that has been difficult to explain is the presence of divergent lineages of R1 in the rDNA loci of the same species. Multiple lineages should compete for a limited number of insertion sites, in addition to being subject to the concerted evolution processes homogenizing the rRNA genes. The presence of multiple lineages suggests either the ability of the elements to overcome these factors and diverge within rDNA loci, or the introduction of new lineages by horizontal transmission. To address this issue, we attempted to characterize the complete set of R1 elements in the rDNA locus from five Drosophila species groups (melanogaster, obscura, testacea, quinaria, and repleta). Two major R1 lineages, A and B, that diverged about 100 MYA were found to exist in Drosophila. Elements of the A lineage were found in all 35 Drosophila species tested, while elements of the B lineage were found in only 11 species from three species groups. Phylogenetic analysis of the R1 elements, supported by comparison of their rates of nucleotide sequence substitution, revealed that both the A and the B lineages have been maintained by vertical descent. The B lineage was less stable and has undergone numerous, independent elimination events, while the A lineage has diverged into three sublineages, which were, in turn, differentially stable. We conclude that while the differential retention of multiple lineages greatly complicates its phylogenetic history, the available R1 data continue to be consistent with the strict vertical descent of these elements.

N2  - Several studies have shown DNA loss to be inversely correlated with genome size in animals. These studies include a comparison between Drosophila and the cricket, Laupala, but there has been no assessment of DNA loss in insects with very large genomes. Podisma pedestris, the brown mountain grasshopper, has a genome over 100 times as large as that of Drosophila and 10 times as large as that of Laupala. We used 58 paralogous nuclear pseudogenes of mitochondrial origin to study the characteristics of insertion, deletion, and point substitution in P. pedestris and Italopodisma. In animals, these pseudogenes are "dead on arrival"; they are abundant in many different eukaryotes, and their mitochondrial origin simplifies the identification of point substitutions accumulated in nuclear pseudogene lineages. There appears to be a mononucleotide repeat within the 643-bp pseudogene sequence studied that acts as a strong hot spot for insertions or deletions (indels). Because the data for other insect species did not contain such an unusual region, hot spots were excluded from species comparisons. The rate of DNA loss relative to point substitution appears to be considerably and significantly lower in the grasshoppers studied than in Drosophila or Laupala. This suggests that the inverse correlation between genome size and the rate of DNA loss can be extended to comparisons between insects with large or gigantic genomes (i.e., Laupala and Podisma). The low rate of DNA loss implies that in grasshoppers, the accumulation of point mutations is a more potent force for obscuring ancient pseudogenes than their loss through indel accumulation, whereas the reverse is true for Drosophila. The main factor contributing to the difference in the rates of DNA loss estimated for grasshoppers, crickets, and Drosophila appears to be deletion size. Large deletions are relatively rare in Podisma and Italopodisma.

N2  - Analysis of 33 GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) full or nearly full genome sequences revealed several putative inter- and intrasubtype recombinants. The breakpoints of the recombinant regions were mapped using a maximum-likelihood method, and the statistical significance for each region was tested using Monte Carlo simulation. The results were highly significant and provided evidence for the existence of complex mosaic genomes showing as many as nine recombination events, with breakpoints in the 5' UTR and in all of the coding regions except the short NS4b gene. Recombination was confirmed by separate phylogenetic analysis of the various recombinant regions and by Sawyer's runs test. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that recombination is common in natural populations of GBV-C and that it takes place both within and between subtypes. The wide-ranging implications of such nonclonal history for reconstructing the spread and timescale of GBV-C evolution are discussed.

N2  - Surveys of molecular variation in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans have suggested that diversity outside of Africa is a subset of that within Africa. It has been argued that reduced levels of diversity in non-African populations reflect a population bottleneck, adaptation to temperate climates, or both. Here, I summarize the available single-nucleotide polymorphism data for both species. A simple "out of Africa" bottleneck scenario is consistent with geographic patterns for loci on the X chromosome but not with loci on the autosomes. Interestingly, there is a trend toward lower nucleotide diversity on the X chromosome relative to autosomes in non-African populations of D. melanogaster, but the opposite trend is seen in African populations. In African populations, autosomal inversion polymorphisms in D. melanogaster may contribute to reduced autosome diversity relative to the X chromosome. To elucidate the role that selection might play in shaping patterns of variability, I present a summary of within- and between-species patterns of synonymous and replacement variation in both species. Overall, D. melanogaster autosomes harbor an excess of amino acid replacement polymorphisms relative to D. simulans. Interestingly, range expansion from Africa appears to have had little effect on synonymous-to-replacement polymorphism ratios.

N2  - Most "tests of neutrality" assess whether particular data sets depart from the predictions of a standard neutral model with no recombination. For Drosophila, where nuclear polymorphism data routinely show evidence of genetic exchange, the assumption of no recombination is often unrealistic. In addition, while conservative, this assumption is made at the cost of a great loss in power. Perhaps as a result, tests of the frequency spectrum based on zero recombination suggest an adequate fit of Drosophila polymorphism data to the predictions of the standard neutral model. Here, we analyze the frequency spectrum of a large number of loci in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans using two summary statistics. We use an estimate of the population recombination rate based on a laboratory estimate of the rate of crossing over per physical length and an estimate of the species' effective population size. In contrast to previous studies, we find that roughly half of the loci depart from the predictions of the standard neutral model. The extent of the departure depends on the exact recombination rate, but the global pattern that emerges is robust. Interestingly, these departures from neutral expectations are not unidirectional. The large variance in outcomes may be due to a complex demographic history and inconsistent sampling, or to the pervasive action of natural selection.

N2  - Darwin's finches comprise a group of 15 species endemic to the Galapagos (14 species) and Cocos (1 species) Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The group is monophyletic and originated from an ancestral species that reached the Galapagos Archipelago from Central or South America. Descendants of this ancestor on the Archipelago then colonized Cocos Island. In the present study, we used sequences of two mitochondrial (mt) DNA segments (922 bp of the cytochrome b gene and 1,082 bp of the control region), as well as two nuclear markers (830 bp of numt2, consisting of 140 bp of mtDNA control region and 690 bp of flanking nuclear DNA; and 740 bp of numt3, consisting of 420 bp of mt cytochrome b sequence flanked by 320 bp of nuclear DNA) to identify the species group most closely related to the Darwin's finches. To this end, we analyzed the sequences of 28 species representing the main groups (tribes) of the family Fringillidae, as well as 2 outgroup species and 13 species of Darwin's finches. In addition, we used mtDNA cytochrome b sequences of some 180 additional Fringillidae species from the database for phylogeny reconstruction by maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, minimum-evolution, and neighbor-joining methods. The study identifies the grassquit genus Tiaris, and specifically the species Tiaris obscura, as the nearest living relative of Darwin's finches among the species surveyed. Darwin's finches diverged from the Tiaris group shortly after the various extant species of Tiaris diverged from one another. The initial adaptive radiation of the Tiaris group apparently occurred on the Caribbean islands and then spread to Central and South America, from where the ancestors of Darwin's finches departed for the Galapagos Islands approximately 2.3 MYA, at the time of the dramatic climatic changes associated with the closure of the Panamanian isthmus and the onset of Pleistocene glaciation.

N2  - Many signaling molecules are multidomain proteins that have other domains in addition to the catalytic kinase domain. Protein tyrosine kinases almost without exception contain Src homology 2 (SH2) and/or SH3 domains that can interact with other signaling proteins. Here, we studied evolution of the tyrosine kinases containing SH2 and/or SH3 and kinase domains. The three domains seem to have duplicated together, since the phylogenetic analysis using parsimony gave almost identical evolutionary trees for the separate domains and the multidomain complexes. The congruence analysis of the sequences for the separate domains also suggested that the domains have coevolved. There are several reasons for the domains to appear in a cluster. Kinases are regulated in many ways, and the presence of SH2 and SH3 domains at proper positions is crucial. Because all three domains can recognize different parts of ligands and substrates, their evolution has been interconnected. The reasons for the clustering and coevolution of the three domains in protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are discussed.

N2  - cDNAs for alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) isozymes were cloned and sequenced from two tephritid fruit flies, the medfly Ceratitis capitata and the olive fly Bactrocera oleae. Because of the high sequence divergence compared with the Drosophila sequences, the medfly cDNAs were cloned using sequence information from the purified proteins, and the olive fly cDNAs were cloned by functional complementation in yeast. The medfly peptide sequences are about 83% identical to each other, and the corresponding mRNAs have the tissue distribution shown by the corresponding isozymes, ADH-1 and ADH-2. The olive fly peptide sequence is more closely related to medfly ADH-2. The tephritid ADHs share less than 40% sequence identity with Drosophila ADH and ADH-related genes but are >57% identical to the ADH of the flesh fly Sarcophaga peregrina, a more distantly related species. To explain this unexpected finding, it is proposed that the Adh genes of the family Drosophilidae may not be orthologous to the Adh genes of the other two families, Tephritidae and Sarcophagidae.

N2  - Dosage compensation in Drosophila is mediated by a complex of proteins and RNAs called the "compensasome." Two of the genes that encode proteins of the complex, maleless (mle) and males-absent-on-the-first (mof), respectively, belong to the DEAH helicase and MYST acetyltransferase gene families. We performed comprehensive phylogenetic and structural analyses to determine the evolutionary histories of these two gene families and thus to better understand the origin of the compensasome. All of the members of the DEAH and MYST families of the completely sequenced Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans genomes, as well as those so far (June 2000) found in Drosophila melanogaster (for which the euchromatic part of the genome has also been fully sequenced) and Homo sapiens, were analyzed. We describe a total of 39 DEAH helicases in these four species. Almost all of them can be grouped in just three main branches. The first branch includes the yeast PRP2, PRP16, PRP22, and PRP43 splicing factors and their orthologs in animal species. Each PRP gene has a single ortholog in metazoans. The second branch includes just four genes, found in yeast (Ecm16) and Drosophila (kurz) and their orthologs in humans and Caenorhabditis. The third branch includes (1) a single yeast gene (YLR419w); (2) six Drosophila genes, including maleless and spindle-E/homeless; (3) four human genes, among them the ortholog of maleless, which encodes RNA helicase A; and (4) three C. elegans genes, including orthologs of maleless and spindle-E. Thus, this branch has largely expanded in metazoans. We also show that, for the whole DEAH family, only MLE and its metazoan orthologs have acquired new protein domains since the fungi/animals split. We found a total of 17 MYST family proteins in the four analyzed species. We determined putative orthologs of mof in both C. elegans and H. sapiens, and we show that the most likely ortholog in yeast is the Sas2 gene. Moreover, a paralog of mof exists in Drosophila. All of these results, together with those found for a third member of the compensasome, msl-3, suggest that this complex emerged after the fungi/animals split and that it may be present in mammalian species. Both gene duplication and the acquisition of new protein modules may have played important roles in the origin of the compensasome.

N2  - From the DNA sequences for N taxa, the (generally unknown) phylogenetic tree T that gave rise to them is to be reconstructed. Various methods give rise, for each quartet J consisting of exactly four taxa, to a predicted tree L(J) based only on the sequences in J, and these are then used to reconstruct T. The author defines an "error-correcting map" (Ec), which replaces each L(J) with a new tree, Ec(L)(J), which has been corrected using other trees, L(K), in the list L. The "quartet distance" between two trees is defined as the number of quartets J on which the two trees differ, and two distinct trees are shown to always have quartet distance of at least N - 3. If L has quartet distance at most (N - 4)/2 from T, then Ec(L) will coincide with the correct list for T; and this result cannot be improved. In general, Ec can correct many more errors in L. Iteration of the map Ec may produce still more accurate lists. Simulations are reported which often show improvement even when the quartet distance considerably exceeds (N - 4)/2. Moreover, the Buneman tree for Ec(L) is shown to refine the Buneman tree for L, so that strongly supported edges for L remain strongly supported for Ec(L). Simulations show that if methods such as the C-tree or hypercleaning are applied to Ec(L), the resulting trees often have more resolution than when the methods are applied only to L.

N2  - Rates of molecular evolution vary over time and, hence, among lineages. In contrast, widely used methods for estimating divergence times from molecular sequence data assume constancy of rates. Therefore, methods for estimation of divergence times that incorporate rate variation are attractive. Improvements on a previously proposed Bayesian technique for divergence time estimation are described. New parameterization more effectively captures the phylogenetic structure of rate evolution on a tree. Fossil information and other evidence can now be included in Bayesian analyses in the form of constraints on divergence times. Simulation results demonstrate that the accuracy of divergence time estimation is substantially enhanced when constraints are included.

N2  - The genome sequence of Thermotoga maritima revealed that 24% of its open reading frames (ORFs) showed the highest similarity scores to archaeal genes in BLAST analyses. Here we screened 16 strains from the genus Thermotoga and other related Thermotogales for the occurrence of two of these "archaeal" genes: the gene encoding the large subunit of glutamate synthase (gltB) and the myo-inositol 1P synthase gene (ino1). Both genes were restricted to the Thermotoga species within the Thermotogales. The distribution of the two genes, along with results from phylogenetic analyses, showed that they were acquired from Archaea during the divergence of the Thermotogales. Database searches revealed that three other bacteria--Dehalococcoides ethenogenes, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Clostridium difficile--possess archaeal-type gltBs, and the phylogenetic analyses confirmed at least two lateral gene transfer (LGT) events between Bacteria and Archaea. These LGT events were also strongly supported by gene structure data, as the three domains in bacterial-type gltB are homologous to three independent ORFs in Archaea and Bacteria with archaeal-type gltBs. The ino1 gene has a scattered distribution among Bacteria, and apart from the Thermotoga strains it is found only in Aquifex aeolicus, D. ethenogenes, and some high-G+C Gram-positive bacteria. Phylogenetic analysis of the ino1 sequences revealed three highly supported prokaryotic clades, all containing a mixture of archaeal and bacterial sequences, and suggested that all bacterial ino1 genes had been recruited from archaeal donors. The Thermotoga strains and A. aeolicus acquired this gene independently from different archaeal species. Although transfer of genes from hyperthermophilic Archaea may have facilitated the evolution of bacterial hyperthermophily, between-domain transfers also affect mesophilic species. For hyperthermophiles, we hypothesize that LGT may be as much a consequence as the cause of adaptation to hyperthermophily.

N2  - The evolution of species-specific fertilization in free-spawning marine invertebrates is important for reproductive isolation and may contribute to speciation. The biochemistry and evolution of proteins mediating species-specific fertilization have been extensively studied in the abalone (genus Haliotis). The nonenzymatic sperm protein lysin creates a hole in the egg vitelline envelope by species-specifically binding to its egg receptor, VERL. The divergence of lysin is promoted by positive Darwinian selection. In contrast, the evolution of VERL does not depart from neutrality. Here, we cloned a novel nonrepetitive region of VERL and performed an intraspecific polymorphism survey for red (Haliotis rufescens) and pink (Haliotis corrugata) abalones to explore the evolutionary forces affecting VERL. Six statistical tests showed that the evolution of VERL did not depart from neutrality. Interestingly, there was a subdivision in the VERL sequences in the pink abalone and a lack of heterozygous individuals between groups, suggesting that the evolution of assortative mating may be in progress. These results are consistent with a model which posits that egg VERL is neutrally evolving, perhaps due to its repetitive structure, while sperm lysin is subjected to positive Darwinian selection to maintain efficient interaction of the two proteins during sperm competition.

N2  - Factors that influence the genesis and genomic distribution of microsatellite DNA are poorly understood. We have identified a novel class of Dipteran mobile elements, mini-me elements, which help elucidate both of these issues. These retroposons contain two internal proto-microsatellite regions that commonly expand into lengthy microsatellite repeats. These elements are highly abundant, accounting for approximately 1.2% of the Drosophila melanogaster genome, giving them the potential to be a prolific source of microsatellite DNA variation. They also give us the opportunity to observe the outcomes of multiple microsatellite genesis events (initiating from the same proto-microsatellite) at separate mini-me loci. Based on these observations, we determined that the genesis of microsatellites within mini-me elements occurs through two separate mutational processes: the expansion of preexisting tandem repeats and the conversion of sequence with high cryptic simplicity into tandemly repetitive DNA. These modes of microsatellite genesis can be generalized beyond the case of mini-me elements and help to explain the genesis of microsatellites in any sequence region that is not constrained by selection.

N2  - Employing comparative analysis of the cDNA-coding sequences of the unique preprorelaxin of the Afro-lorisiform Galago crassicaudatus and the Malagasy lemur Varecia variegata and the relaxin-like factor (RLF) of G. crassicaudatus, we demonstrated distinct differences in the dynamics of molecular remodeling of both hormones during primate evolution. The lorisiform and lemuriform preprorelaxin sequences encoded identical hormones, providing the first endocrinological evidence for the monophyletic origin of all Strepsirrhini. Structural analysis revealed the lemuriform members of the relaxin family to be potentially bioactive single-gene products. In contrast to the "two-prong" relaxin receptor-binding motif (RELVR) present within the B-domains of other primate relaxins, strepsirrhine relaxin contained a unique "three-prong" motif (RRLIR) with highest sequence homology to the receptor-binding motif of the evolutionarily much older skate relaxin. In contrast to relaxin, the RLF molecule was highly conserved during primate evolution and contained within its B-domain the putative relaxin receptor-binding motif and a pentameric sequence implicated in binding to specific RLF receptors. Mutually exclusive expression of strepsirrhine preprorelaxin and RLF were observed in the fetal villous trophoblast cells of the strepsirrhine placenta and postpubertal testicular Leydig cells, respectively, reflecting distinct functional roles for both hormones within the reproductive tract of Strepsirrhini.

N2  - Horizontal gene transfer is now recognized as an important mechanism of evolution. Several methods to detect horizontally transferred genes have been suggested. These methods are based on either nucleotide composition or the failure to find a similar gene in closely related species. Genes that evolve vertically between closely related species can be divided into those that retain homologous chromosomal positions (positional orthologs) and those that do not. By comparing open reading frames in the Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi genomes, we identified 2,728 positional orthologs since these species split 100 MYA. A group of 1,144 novel E. coli genes were unusually diverged from their S. typhi counterparts. These novel genes included those that had been horizontally transferred into E. coli, as well as members of gene pairs that had been rearranged or deleted. Positional orthologs were used to investigate compositional methods of identifying horizontally transferred genes. A large number of E. coli genes with normal nucleotide composition have no apparent ortholog in S. typhi, and many genes of atypical composition do, in fact, have positional orthologs. A phylogenetic approach was employed to confirm selected examples of horizontal transmission among the novel groups of genes. Our analysis of 80 E. coli genes determined that a number of genes previously classified as horizontally transferred based on base composition and codon bias were native, and genes previously classified as native appeared to be horizontally transferred. Hence, atypical nucleotide composition alone is not a reliable indicator of horizontal transmission.

N2  - Here, we develop a new approach to Markov chain modeling of microsatellite evolution through polymerase slippage and introduce new models: a "constant-slippage-rate" model, in which there is no dependence of slippage rate on microsatellite length, as envisaged by Moran; and a "linear-with-constant" model, in which slippage rate increases linearly with microsatellite length, but the line of best fit is not constrained to go through the origin. We show how these and a linear no-constant model can be fitted to data hierarchically using maximum likelihood. This has advantages over previous methods in allowing statistical comparisons between models. When applied to a previously analyzed data set, the method allowed us to statistically establish that slippage rate increases with microsatellite length for dinucleotide microsatellites in humans, mice, and fruit flies, and suggested that no slippage occurs in very short microsatellites of one to four repeats. The suggestion that slippage rates are zero or close to zero for very short microsatellites of one to four repeats has important implications for understanding the mechanism of polymerase slippage.

N2  - The phylum Apicomplexa encompasses a large number of intracellular protozoan parasites, including the causative agents of malaria (Plasmodium), toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma), and many other human and animal diseases. Apicomplexa have recently been found to contain a relic, nonphotosynthetic plastid that has attracted considerable interest as a possible target for therapeutics. This plastid is known to have been acquired by secondary endosymbiosis, but when this occurred and from which type of alga it was acquired remain uncertain. Based on the molecular phylogeny of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) genes, we provide evidence that the apicomplexan plastid is homologous to plastids found in dinoflagellates--close relatives of apicomplexa that contain secondary plastids of red algal origin. Surprisingly, apicomplexan and dinoflagellate plastid-targeted GAPDH sequences were also found to be closely related to the plastid-targeted GAPDH genes of heterokonts and cryptomonads, two other groups that contain secondary plastids of red algal origin. These results address several outstanding issues: (1) apicomplexan and dinoflagellate plastids appear to be the result of a single endosymbiotic event which occurred relatively early in eukaryotic evolution, also giving rise to the plastids of heterokonts and perhaps cryptomonads; (2) apicomplexan plastids are derived from a red algal ancestor; and (3) the ancestral state of apicomplexan parasites was photosynthetic.

N2  - According to the observed alignment pattern (i.e., amino acid configuration), we studied two basic types of functional divergence of a protein family. Type I functional divergence after gene duplication results in altered functional constraints (i.e., different evolutionary rate) between duplicate genes, whereas type II results in no altered functional constraints but radical change in amino acid property between them (e.g., charge, hydrophobicity, etc.). Two statistical approaches, i.e., the subtree likelihood and the whole-tree likelihood, were developed for estimating the coefficients of (type I or type II) functional divergence. Numerical algorithms for obtaining maximum-likelihood estimates are also provided. Moreover, a posterior-based site-specific profile is implemented to predict critical amino acid residues that are responsible for type I and/or type II functional divergence after gene duplication. We compared the current likelihood with a fast method developed previously by examples; both show similar results. For handling altered functional constraints (type I functional divergence) in the large gene family with many member genes (clusters), which appears to be a normal case in postgenomics, the subtree likelihood provides a solution that is computationally feasible and robust against the uncertainty of the phylogeny. The cost of this feasibility is the approximation when frequencies of amino acids are very skewed. The potential bias and correction are discussed.

N2  - In the Linnaean system of classification, the generic status of a species is part of its binomial name, and it is therefore important that the classification at the level of genus is consistent at least in related groups of organisms. Using maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees constructed from a large number of complete or nearly complete mammalian cytochrome b sequences, I show that the distributions of intrageneric and intergeneric distances derived from these trees are clearly separated, which allows the limits for a more rational generic classification of mammals to be established. The analysis of genetic distances among hominids in this context provides strong support for the inclusion of humans and chimpanzees in the same genus. It is also of interest to decipher the main reasons for the possible biases in the mammalian classification. I found by correlation analysis that the classification of mammals of large body size tends to be oversplit, whereas that of small mammals has an excess of lumping, which may be a manifestation of the larger difficulty in finding diagnostic characters in the classification of small animals. In addition, and contrary to some previous observations, there is no correlation between body size and rate of cytochrome b evolution in mammals, which excludes the difference in evolutionary rates as the cause of the observed body size taxonomic bias.

N2  - Mitochondrial DNA control region sequences of orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) from six different populations on the island of Borneo were determined and analyzed for evidence of regional diversity and were compared separately with orangutans from the island of Sumatra. Within the Bornean population, four distinct subpopulations were identified. Furthermore, the results of this study revealed marked divergence, supportive evidence of speciation between Sumatran and Bornean orangutans. This study demonstrates that, as an entire population, Bornean orangutans have not experienced a serious genetic bottleneck, which has been suggested as the cause of low diversity in humans and east African chimpanzees. Based on these new data, it is estimated that Bornean and Sumatran orangutans diverged approximately 1.1 MYA and that the four distinct Bornean populations diverged 860,000 years ago. These findings have important implications for management, breeding, and reintroduction practices in orangutan conservation efforts.

N2  - Most evolutionary tree estimation methods for DNA sequences ignore or inefficiently use the phylogenetic information contained within shared patterns of gaps. This is largely due to the computational difficulties in implementing models for insertions and deletions. A simple way to incorporate this information is to treat a gap as a fifth character (with the four nucleotides being the other four) and to incorporate it within a Markov model of nucleotide substitution. This idea has been dismissed in the past, since it treats a multiple-site insertion or deletion as a sequence of independent events rather than a single event. While this is true, we have found that under many circumstances it is better to incorporate gap information inadequately than to ignore it, at least for topology estimation. We propose an extension to a class of nucleotide substitution models to incorporate the gap character and show that, for data sets (both real and simulated) with short and medium gaps, these models do lead to effective use of the information contained within insertions and deletions. We also implement an ad hoc method in which the likelihood at columns containing multiple-site gaps is downweighted in order to avoid giving them undue influence. The precision of the estimated tree, assessed using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to find the posterior distribution over tree space, improves under these five-state models compared with standard methods which effectively ignore gaps.

N2  - Homeobox genes encode transcription factors involved in many aspects of developmental processes. The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) genes, which are characterized by the presence of both a homeodomain and a leucine zipper motif, form a clade within the homeobox superfamily and were previously reported only from vascular plants. Here we report the isolation of 10 HD-Zip genes (named Pphb1-Pphb10) from the moss Physcomitrella patens. Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the 10 Pphb genes and previously reported vascular plant HD-Zip genes, all of the Pphb genes except Pphb3 belong to three of the four HD-Zip subfamilies (HD-Zip I, II, and III), indicating that these subfamilies originated before the divergence of the vascular plant and moss lineages. Pphb3 is sister to the HD-Zip II subfamily and has some distinctive characteristics, including the difference of the a1 and d1 sites of its leucine zipper motif, which are well conserved in each HD-Zip subfamily. Comparison of the genetic divergence of representative HD-Zip I and II genes showed that the evolutionary rate of HD-Zip I genes was faster than that of HD-Zip II genes.

N2  - The diversity of T-cell receptors is generated primarily by the variable-region gene families, each of which is composed of a large number of member genes. The entire genomic sequence of the variable region (VB) of the T- cell receptor β chain from humans and mice has become available. To understand the evolutionary dynamics of the VB gene family, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of all VB genes from humans and mice, as well as a detailed analysis of internal DNA duplications in the human genomic VB region. The phylogenetic tree obtained shows that human and mouse VB genes intermingle extensively rather than forming two separate clusters and that many gene duplications occurred both before and after the divergence between primates and rodents. Analyzing the genomic maps of transposable elements (e.g., LINEs and SINEs) and relic VB genes in the VB gene region, we present evidence that a 20-kb VB region duplicated tandemly four times in the human lineage during the last 32 Myr, and 6 out of the 15 VB genes in this region have become nonfunctional during this period. Our results show that the VB gene family is subject to evolution by a birth-and-death process rather than to concerted evolution.

N2  - Jakobids are free-living, heterotrophic flagellates that might represent early-diverging mitochondrial protists. They share ultrastructural similarities with eukaryotes that occupy basal positions in molecular phylogenies, and their mitochondrial genome architecture is eubacterial-like, suggesting a close affinity with the ancestral alpha-proteobacterial symbiont that gave rise to mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. To elucidate relationships among jakobids and other early-diverging eukaryotic lineages, we characterized alpha- and beta-tubulin genes from four jakobids: Jakoba libera, Jakoba incarcerata, Reclinomonas americana (the "core jakobids"), and Malawimonas jakobiformis. These are the first reports of nuclear genes from these organisms. Phylogenies based on alpha-, beta-, and combined alpha- plus beta-tubulin protein data sets do not support the monophyly of the jakobids. While beta-tubulin and combined alpha- plus beta-tubulin phylogenies showed a sister group relationship between J. libera and R. americana, the two other jakobids, M. jakobiformis and J. incarcerata, had unclear affinities. In all three analyses, J. libera, R. americana, and M. jakobiformis emerged from within a well-supported large "plant-protist" clade that included plants, green algae, cryptophytes, stramenopiles, alveolates, Euglenozoa, Heterolobosea, and several other protist groups, but not animals, fungi, microsporidia, parabasalids, or diplomonads. A preferred branching order within the plant-protist clade was not identified, but there was a tendency for the J. libera-R. americana lineage to group with a clade made up of the heteroloboseid amoeboflagellates and euglenozoan protists. Jakoba incarcerata branched within the plant-protist clade in the beta- and the combined alpha- plus beta-tubulin phylogenies. In alpha- tubulin trees, J. incarcerata occupied an unresolved position, weakly grouping with the animal/fungal/microsporidian group or with amitochondriate parabasalid and diplomonad lineages, depending on the phylogenetic method employed. Tubulin gene phylogenies were in general agreement with mitochondrial gene phylogenies and ultrastructural data in indicating that the "jakobids" may be polyphyletic. Relationships with the putatively deep-branching amitochondriate diplomonads remain uncertain.

N2  - Because a microdeletion containing the DAZ gene is the most frequently observed deletion in infertile men, the DAZ gene was considered a strong candidate for the azoospermia factor. A recent evolutionary analysis, however, suggested that DAZ was free from functional constraints and consequently played little or no role in human spermatogenesis. The major evidence for this surprising conclusion is that the nonsynonymous substitution rate is similar to the synonymous rate and to the rate in introns. In this study, we reexamined the evolution of the DAZ gene family by using maximum-likelihood methods, which accommodate variable selective pressures among sites or among branches. The results suggest that DAZ is not free from functional constraints. Most amino acids in DAZ are under strong selective constraint, while a few sites are under diversifying selection with nonsynonymous/ synonymous rate ratios (dN/dS) well above 1. As a result, the average dN/dS ratio over sites is not a sensible measure of selective pressure on the protein. Lineage-specific analysis indicated that human members of this gene family were evolving by positive Darwinian selection, although the evidence was not strong.

N2  - We identified a novel gene encoding molecular chaperone HSP70 in the amitochondriate parasite Giardia lamblia. The predicted protein is similar to bacterial DnaK and mitochondrial HSP70s. The gene is transcribed and translated at a constant level during trophozoite growth and encystation. Alignment of the sequence with a data set of cytosolic, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondrial, and DnaK HSP70 homologs indicated that the sequence was extremely divergent and contained insertions unique to giardial HSP70s. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that this sequence was distinct from the cytosolic and ER forms and was most similar to proteobacterial and mitochondrial DnaKs. However, a specific relationship with the alpha proteobacterial and mitochondrial sequences was not strongly supported by phylogenetic analyses of this data set, in contrast to similar analyses of cpn60. These data neither confirm nor reject the possibility that this gene is a relic of secondary mitochondrial loss; they leave open the possibility that it was acquired in a separate endosymbiotic event.

N2  - Cytochrome P450 aromatase (Cyp19) is an enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of estrogens, thereby controlling various physiological functions of estrogens. We isolated two cyp19 cDNAs, termed cyp19a and cyp19b, respectively, from zebrafish. These genes are located in linkage groups 18 and 25, respectively. Detailed gene mapping indicated that zebrafish linkage groups 18 and 25 may have arisen from the same ancestral chromosome by a chromosome duplication event. Cyp19a is expressed mainly in the follicular cells lining the vitellogenic oocytes in the ovary during vitellogenesis. Cyp19b is expressed abundantly in the brain, at the hypothalamus and ventral telencephalon, extending to the olfactory bulbs. The expression of duplicated cyp19 genes at two different tissues highlights the evolutionary significance of maintaining two active genes on duplicated zebrafish chromosomes for specific functions in the ovary and the brain.

N2  - The evolutionary origins of microsatellites are not well understood. Some investigators have suggested that point mutations that expand repeat arrays beyond a threshold size trigger microsatellites to become variable. However, little empirical data has been brought forth on this and related issues. In this study, we examine the evolutionary history of microsatellites in six species within the obscura group of Drosophila, tracing changes in microsatellite alleles using both PCR product size and sequence data. We found little evidence supporting a general role of point mutations triggering initial microsatellite expansion, and no consistent threshold size for expansion was observed. Flanking region length variation was extensive when alleles were sequenced in distantly related species, and some species possessed altogether different repeat arrays between the same primer binding sites. Our results suggest extreme caution in using microsatellite allele sizes for phylogenetic analyses or to infer divergences between populations.

N2  - Gene duplication provides the opportunity for subsequent refinement of distinct functions of the duplicated copies. Either through changes in coding sequence or changes in regulatory regions, duplicate copies appear to obtain new or tissue-specific functions. If this divergence were driven by natural selection, we would expect duplicated copies to have differentiated patterns of substitutions. We tested this hypothesis using genes that duplicated before the human/mouse split and whose orthologous relations were clear. The null hypothesis is that the number of amino acid changes between humans and mice was distributed similarly across different paralogs. We used a method modified from Tang and Lewontin to detect heterogeneity in the amino acid substitution pattern between those different paralogs. Our results show that many of the paralogous gene pairs appear to be under differential selection in the human/mouse comparison. The properties that led to diversification appear to have arisen before the split of the human and mouse lineages. Further study of the diverged genes revealed insights regarding the patterns of amino acid substitution that resulted in differences in function and/or expression of these genes. This approach has utility in the study of newly identified members of gene families in genomewide data mining and for contrasting the merits of alternative hypotheses for the evolutionary divergence of function of duplicated genes.

N2  - Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-encoded proteins function in eukaryotes as subunits of respiratory complexes that also contain nuclear DNA (nDNA)-encoded subunits. The importance of functional interactions between mtDNA- and nDNA-encoded proteins was previously demonstrated by testing the survivability of cybrid cells or individuals containing nDNA and mtDNA from different populations or species. This report focuses on the multisubunit respiratory complex cytochrome c oxidase (COX), made up of both mtDNA-encoded and nDNA-encoded subunits. A combination of evolutionary and crystallographic data is employed to determine whether rates of nonsynonymous substitutions have been higher, the same, or lower for residues in close proximity that are encoded by a different genome (nDNA or mtDNA). This determination is performed by simply taking the ratio, called the interaction ratio i, of the nonsynonymous substitution rate of the close-contact residues to the nonsynonymous substitution rate of the noncontact residues. We assume that the close-contact residues (which are more likely to interact) are functionally important and that, therefore, amino acid replacements among these residues cannot escape the scrutiny of natural selection. i = 1 indicates that the close-contact residues have been under neither greater purifying selection nor greater positive selection than the noncontact residues as a specific consequence of their being encoded by separate genomes. i < 1 indicates that the close-contact residues have been under greater purifying selection but less positive selection than have the noncontact residues. Conversely, i > 1 indicates that the close-contact residues have been under less purifying but greater positive selection than have the noncontact residues. i < 1 may be referred to as a constraining interaction; i.e., the close-contact residues compared with the noncontact residues appear to be under greater structural-functional constraints. On the other hand, i > 1 may be referred to as an optimizing interaction; i.e., apparently many different amino acid replacements are required to optimize this subunit's interaction with the other subunit. A major finding is that the nDNA-encoded residues in close physical proximity to mtDNA-encoded residues evolve more slowly than the other nuclear-encoded residues (and thus display a constraining interaction), whereas the mtDNA-encoded residues in close physical proximity to nDNA-encoded residues evolve more rapidly than the other mitochondrial-encoded residues (and thus display an optimizing interaction). A possible reason for this striking difference between the nuclear- and mitochondrial-encoded COX subunits in how their functional interaction evolves is discussed.

N2  - The hemoglobin molecule of the commercially important brine shrimp Artemia sp. has been used extensively as a model for the study of molecular evolution. It consists of nine globin domains joined by short linker sequences, and these domains are believed to have originated through a series of duplications from an original globin gene. In addition, in Artemia, two different polymers of hemoglobin, called C and T, are found which differ by 11.7% at the amino acid level and are believed to have diverged about 60 MYA. This provides a set of data of 18 globin domain sequences that have evolved in the same organism. The pattern of amino acid substitution between these two polymers is unusual, with pairs of equivalent domains displaying differences of up to 2.7-fold in total amino acid substitution. Such differences would reflect a similar range of molecular-clock rates in what appear to be duplicate, structurally equivalent domains. In order to provide a reference outgroup, we sequenced the cDNA for a nine-domain hemoglobin (P) from another genus of brine shrimp, Parartemia zietziana, which differs morphologically and ecologically from Artemia and is endemic to Australia. Parartemia produces only one hundredth the amount of hemoglobin that Artemia produces and does not upregulate production in response to low oxygen partial pressure. Comparison of the globin domains at the amino acid and DNA levels suggests that the Artemia globin T gene has accumulated substitutions differently from the Parartemia P and Artemia C globin genes. We discuss the questions of accelerated evolution after duplication and possible functions for the Parartemia globin.

A strong correlation between serpin gene families displaying (1) a conserved exon-intron pattern and (2) family-specific combinations of amino acid residues at specific sites suggests that present-day vertebrates encompass six serpin gene families which evolved from primordial genes by massive intron insertion before or during early vertebrate radiation. Introns placed at homologous positions in the gene sequences in combination with diagnostic sequence characters may also constitute a reliable kinship indicator for other protein superfamilies.

We conducted a distribution survey by Southern blot for 52 species of the family Drosophilidae, mainly from the obscura and melanogaster groups. Most of the analyzed species bear sequences homologous to bilbo from D. subobscura. In the obscura group, species from the same species subgroup also share similar Southern blot patterns. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship among these elements, we analyzed eight copies of a short sequence of the element from several species of the obscura group. The obtained phylogram agrees with the phylogeny of the species, which suggests vertical transmission of the element.

N2  - The cupin superfamily is a group of functionally diverse proteins that are found in all three kingdoms of life, Archaea, Eubacteria, and Eukaryota. These proteins have a characteristic signature domain comprising two histidine- containing motifs separated by an intermotif region of variable length. This domain consists of six beta strands within a conserved beta barrel structure. Most cupins, such as microbial phosphomannose isomerases (PMIs), AraC- type transcriptional regulators, and cereal oxalate oxidases (OXOs), contain only a single domain, whereas others, such as seed storage proteins and oxalate decarboxylases (OXDCs), are bi-cupins with two pairs of motifs. Although some cupins have known functions and have been characterized at the biochemical level, the majority are known only from gene cloning or sequencing projects. In this study, phylogenetic analyses were conducted on the conserved domain to investigate the evolution and structure/function relationships of cupins, with an emphasis on single- domain plant germin-like proteins (GLPs). An unrooted phylogeny of cupins from a wide spectrum of evolutionary lineages identified three main clusters, microbial PMIs, OXDCs, and plant GLPs. The sister group to the plant GLPs in the global analysis was then used to root a phylogeny of all available plant GLPs. The resulting phylogeny contained three main clades, classifying the GLPs into distinct subfamilies. It is suggested that these subfamilies correlate with functional categories, one of which contains the bifunctional barley germin that has both OXO and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. It is proposed that GLPs function primarily as SODs, enzymes that protect plants from the effects of oxidative stress. Closer inspection of the DNA sequence encoding the intermotif region in plant GLPs showed global conservation of thymine in the second codon position, a character associated with hydrophobic residues. Since many of these proteins are multimeric and enzymatically inactive in their monomeric state, this conservation of hydrophobicity is thought to be associated with the need to maintain the various monomer- monomer interactions. The type of structure-based predictive analysis presented in this paper is an important approach for understanding gene function and evolution in an era when genomes from a wide range of organisms are being sequenced at a rapid rate.

N2  - I present here evidence of remarkable local changes in GC/AT substitution biases and in crossover frequencies on Drosophila chromosomes. The substitution pattern at 10 loci in the telomeric region of the X chromosome was studied for four species of the Drosophila melanogaster species subgroup. Drosophila orena and Drosophila erecta are clearly the most closely related species pair (the erecta complex) among the four species studied; however, the overall data at the 10 loci revealed a clear dichotomy in the silent substitution patterns between the AT-biased- substitution melanogaster and erecta lineages and the GC-biased-substitution yakuba and orena lineages, suggesting two or more independent changes in GC/AT substitution biases. More importantly, the results indicated a between- loci heterogeneity in GC/AT substitution bias in this small region independently in the yakuba and orena lineages. Indeed, silent substitutions in the orena lineage were significantly biased toward G and C at the consecutive yellow, lethal of scute, and asense loci, but they were significantly biased toward A and T at sta. The substitution bias toward G and C was centered in different areas in yakuba (significantly biased at EG:165H7.3, EG:171D11.2, and suppressor of sable). The similar silent substitution patterns in coding and noncoding regions, furthermore, suggested mutational biases as a cause of the substitution biases. On the other hand, previous study reveals that Drosophila yakuba has about 20-fold higher crossover frequencies in the telomeric region of the X chromosome than does D. melanogaster; this study revealed that the total genetic map length of the yakuba X chromosome was only about 1.5 times as large as that of melanogaster and that the map length of the X-telomeric y-sta region did not differ between Drosophila yakuba and D. erecta. Taken together, the data strongly suggested that an approximately 20- fold reduction in the X-telomeric crossover frequencies occurred in the ancestral population of D. melanogaster after the melanogaster-yakuba divergence but before the melanogaster-simulans divergence.

N2  - We present in this paper a simple method for estimating the mutation rate per site per year which also yields an estimate of the length of a generation when mutation rate per site per generation is known. The estimator, which takes advantage of DNA polymorphisms in longitudinal samples, is unbiased under a number of population models, including population structure and variable population size over time. We apply the new method to a longitudinal sample of DNA sequences of the env gene of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) from a single patient and obtain 1.62 x 10 as the mutation rate per site per year for HIV-1. Using an independent data set to estimate the mutation rate per generation, we obtain 1.8 days as the length of a generation of HIV-1, which agrees well with recent estimates based on viral load data. Our estimate of generation time differs considerably from a recent estimate by Rodrigo et al. when the same mutation rate per site per generation is used. Some factors that may contribute to the difference among different estimators are discussed.

N2  - Several authors have proposed that changes in a small number of regulatory genes may be sufficient for the evolution of novel morphologies. Recent analyses have indicated that teosinte branched1 (tb1), a putative bHLH transcription factor, played such a role during the morphological evolution of maize from its wild ancestor, teosinte. To address whether or not tb1 played a similar role during the evolution of the Andropogoneae, the tribe to which maize belongs, and to examine the rate and pattern of tb1 evolution within this tribe, we analyzed tb1-like sequences from 23 members of the Andropogoneae and five other grasses. Our analysis revealed that the TB1 protein evolves slowly within three conserved domains but rapidly outside these domains. The nonconserved regions of the gene are characterized by both a high nonsynonymous substitution rate and frequent indels. The ratio of nonsynonymous substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) was not significantly greater than 1.0, providing no evidence for positive selection. However, the dN/dS ratio varied significantly among lineages and was high compared with those of other plant nuclear genes. Variation in the dN/dS ratio among the Andropogoneae could be explained by unequal levels of purifying selection among lineages. Consistent with this interpretation, the rate of nonsynonymous substitution differed along several lineages, while the synonymous substitution rate did not differ significantly. Finally, using tb1, we examined phylogenetic relationships within the Andropogoneae. The phylogeny suggests that the tribe underwent a rapid radiation during its early history and that the monoecious Andropogoneae are polyphyletic.

N2  - Transferrins are iron-binding proteins that are involved in iron storage and resistance to bacterial disease. Previous work has shown that nonsynonymous-to-synonymous-site substitution ratios (dn/ds ratios) between transferrin genes from some salmonid species were significantly greater than 1.0, providing evidence for positive selection at the transferrin gene. The purpose of the current study was to put these earlier results in a broader evolutionary context by examining variation among 25 previously published transferrin sequences from fish, amphibians, and mammals. The results of the study show that evidence for positive selection at transferrin is limited to salmonids--dn/ds ratios estimated for nonsalmonid lineages were generally less than 1.0. Within the salmonids, ~13% of the transferrin codon sites are estimated to be subject to positive selection, with an estimated dn/ds ratio of ~7. The three- dimensional locations of some of the selected sites were inferred by comparing these sites to homologous sites in the bovine lactoferrin crystallographic structure. The selected sites generally fall on the outside of the molecule, within and near areas that are bound by transferrin-binding proteins from human pathogenic bacteria. The physical locations of sites estimated to be subject to positive selection support previous speculation that competition for iron from pathogenic bacteria could be the source of positive selection.

N2  - DNA sequences of the first ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1) were isolated from 10 ladybird beetle species (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) representing four subfamilies (Coccinellinae, Chilocorinae, Scymninae, and Coccidulinae). The spacers ranged in length from 791 to 2,572 bp, thereby including one of the longest ITS1s and exhibiting one of the most extreme cases of ITS1 size variation in eukaryotes recorded to date. The causes of length variation were therefore analyzed. Almost no putatively homologous sequence similarities were identified for the taxa included. The only exception was for the subfamily Coccinellinae, which yielded sequence similarities in six regions of approximately 550 nucleotide positions, primarily at the 5' and 3' ends of ITS1. The majority of differences in ITS1 length between taxa could be attributed to the presence of repetitive elements with comparatively long repeat units. Repetition arose several times independently and was confined to the middle of the spacer which, in contrast to the 5' and 3' ends, had not been inferred in previous studies to be subject to functional constraints. These elements were characterized by high rates of evolutionary change, most likely as a result of high substitution rates in combination with inefficient homogenization across repeats. The repeated origin and subsequent divergence of "long" repetitive elements should thus be assumed to be an important factor in the evolution of coccinellid ITS1.

N2  - To investigate the origin of the African PTLV-I virus, we phylogenetically analyzed the available HTLV-I and STLV-I strains. We also attempted to date the presumed interspecies transmissions that resulted in the African HTLV-I subtypes. Molecular-clock analysis was performed using the Tamura-Nei substitution model and gamma distributed rate heterogeneity based on the maximum-likelihood topology of the combined long-terminal-repeat and env third-codon-position sequences. Since the molecular clock was not rejected and no evidence for saturation was found, a constant rate of evolution at these positions for all 33 HTLV-I and STLV-I strains was reasonably assumed. The spread of PTLV-I in Africa is estimated to have occurred at least 27,300 ± 8,200 years ago. Using the available strains, the HTLV-If subtype appears to have emerged within the last 3,000 years, and the HTLV-Ia, HTLV-Ib, HTLV-Id, and HTLV-Ie subtypes appear to have diverged between 21,100 and 5,300 years ago. Interspecies transmissions, most probably simian to human, must have occurred around that time and probably continued later. When the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution ratios were compared, it was clear that purifying selection was the driving force for PTLV-I evolution in the env gene, irrespective of the host species. Due to the small number of strains in some of the investigated groups, these data on selective pressure should be taken with caution.

N2  - The relative contribution of two parental populations to a hybrid group (the admixture proportions) can be estimated using not only the frequencies of different alleles, but also the degree of molecular divergence between them. In this paper, we extend this possibility to the case of any number of parental populations. The newly derived multiparental estimator is tested by Monte Carlo simulations and by generating artificial hybrid groups by pooling mtDNA samples from human populations. The general properties (including the variance) of the two-parental estimator seem to be retained by the multiparental estimator. When mixed human populations are considered and hypervariable single-locus data are analyzed (mtDNA control region), errors in the estimated contributions appear reasonably low only when highly differentiated parental populations are involved. Finally, the method applied to the hybrid Canary Island population points to a much lower female contribution from Spain than has previously been estimated.

N2  - Previous analysis of mitochondrial DNA polymorphism in the native range of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) demonstrated the occurrence of two highly divergent (2 Myr) maternal lineages with a well-defined geographical distribution. Analysis of both protein and immunoglobulin polymorphisms are highly concordant with this pattern of differentiation. However, the present analysis of nine polymorphic microsatellite loci (with a total of 169 alleles) in 24 wild populations reveals severe allele-size homoplasy which vastly underestimates divergence between the main groups of populations in Iberia. Nonetheless, when applied to more recent historical phenomena, this same data set not only confirms the occurrence of a strong bottleneck associated with the colonization of Mediterranean France but also suggests a two-step dispersal scenario that began with gene flow from northern Spain through the Pyrenean barrier and subsequent range expansion into northern France. The strength and appropriateness of applying microsatellites to more recent evolutionary questions is highlighted by the fact that both mtDNA and protein markers lacked the allelic diversity necessary to properly evaluate the colonization of France. The well-documented natural history of European rabbit populations provides an unusually comprehensive framework within which one can appraise the advantages and limitations of microsatellite markers in revealing patterns of genetic differentiation that have occurred across varying degrees of evolutionary time. The degree of size homoplasy presented in our data should serve as a warning to those drawing conclusions from microsatellite data sets which lack a set of complementary comparative markers, or involve long periods of evolutionary history, even within a single species.

N2  - Phylogenetic inference from amino acid sequence data uses mainly empirical models of amino acid replacement and is therefore dependent on those models. Two of the more widely used models, the Dayhoff and JTT models, are estimated using similar methods that can utilize large numbers of sequences from many unrelated protein families but are somewhat unsatisfactory because they rely on assumptions that may lead to systematic error and discard a large amount of the information within the sequences. The alternative method of maximum-likelihood estimation may utilize the information in the sequence data more efficiently and suffers from no systematic error, but it has previously been applicable to relatively few sequences related by a single phylogenetic tree. Here, we combine the best attributes of these two methods using an approximate maximum-likelihood method. We implemented this approach to estimate a new model of amino acid replacement from a database of globular protein sequences comprising 3,905 amino acid sequences split into 182 protein families. While the new model has an overall structure similar to those of other commonly used models, there are significant differences. The new model outperforms the Dayhoff and JTT models with respect to maximum-likelihood values for a large majority of the protein families in our database. This suggests that it provides a better overall fit to the evolutionary process in globular proteins and may lead to more accurate phylogenetic tree estimates. Potentially, this matrix, and the methods used to generate it, may also be useful in other areas of research, such as biological sequence database searching, sequence alignment, and protein structure prediction, for which an accurate description of amino acid replacement is required.

N2  - Genetic distances play an important role in estimating divergence time of bifurcated populations. However, they can be greatly affected by demographic processes, such as migration and population dynamics, which complicate their interpretation. For example, the widely used distance for microsatellite loci, (δμ), assumes constant population size, no gene flow, and mutation-drift equilibrium. It is shown here that (δμ) strongly underestimates divergence time if populations are growing and/or connected by gene flow. In recent publications, the average estimate of divergence time between African and non-African populations obtained by using (δμ) is about 34,000 years, although archaeological data show a much earlier presence of modern humans out of Africa. I introduce a different estimator of population separation time based on microsatellite statistics, TD, that does not assume mutation-drift equilibrium, is independent of population dynamics in the absence of gene flow, and is robust to weak migration flow for growing populations. However, it requires a knowledge of the variance in the number of repeats at the beginning of population separation, V0. One way to overcome this problem is to find minimal and maximal bounds for the variance and thus obtain the earliest and latest bounds for divergence time (this is not a confidence interval, and it simply reflects an uncertainty about the value of V0 in an ancestral population). Another way to avoid the uncertainty is to choose from among present populations a reference whose variation is presumably close to what it might have been in an ancestral population. A different approach for using TD is to estimate the time difference between adjacent nodes on a phylogenetic population tree. Using data on variation at autosomal short tandem repeat loci with di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats in worldwide populations, TD gives an estimate of 57,000 years for the separation of the out-of-Africa branch of modern humans from Africans based on the value of V0 in the Southern American Indian populations; the earliest bound for this event has been estimated to be about 135,000 years. The data also suggest that the Asian and European populations diverged from each other about 20,000 years, after the occurrence of the out-of-Africa branch.

N2  - Most eukaryotes perform the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate in mitochondria using pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Eukaryotes that lack mitochondria also lack PDH, using instead the O2-sensitive enzyme pyruvate : ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFO), which is localized either in the cytosol or in hydrogenosomes. The facultatively anaerobic mitochondria of the photosynthetic protist Euglena gracilis constitute a hitherto unique exception in that these mitochondria oxidize pyruvate with the O2-sensitive enzyme pyruvate : NADP oxidoreductase (PNO). Cloning and analysis of Euglena PNO revealed that the cDNA encodes a mitochondrial transit peptide followed by an N-terminal PFO domain that is fused to a C-terminal NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) domain. Two independent 5.8-kb full-size cDNAs for Euglena mitochondrial PNO were isolated; the gene was expressed in cultures supplied with 2% CO2 in air and with 2% CO2 in N2. The apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum was also shown to encode and express the same PFO-CPR fusion, except that, unlike E. gracilis, no mitochondrial transit peptide for C. parvum PNO was found. Recombination-derived remnants of PNO are conserved in the genomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe as proteins involved in sulfite reduction. Notably, Trypanosoma brucei was found to encode homologs of both PFO and all four PDH subunits. Gene organization and phylogeny revealed that eukaryotic nuclear genes for mitochondrial, hydrogenosomal, and cytosolic PFO trace to a single eubacterial acquisition. These findings suggest a common ancestry of PFO in amitochondriate protists with Euglena mitochondrial PNO and Cryptosporidium PNO. They are also consistent with the view that eukaryotic PFO domains are biochemical relics inherited from a facultatively anaerobic, eubacterial ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes.

N2  - Using "long-PCR," we amplified in overlapping fragments the complete mitochondrial genome of the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta (Platyhelminthes: Cestoda) and determined its 13,900-nt sequence. The gene content is the same as that typically found for animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) except that atp8 appears to be lacking, a condition found previously for several other animals. Despite the small size of this mtDNA, there are two large noncoding regions, one of which contains 13 repeats of a 31-nt sequence and a potential stem-loop structure of 25 bp with an 11-member loop. Large potential secondary structures were identified also for the noncoding regions of two other cestode mtDNAs. Comparison of the mitochondrial gene arrangement of H. diminuta with those previously published supports a phylogenetic position of flatworms as members of the Eutrochozoa, rather than placing them basal to either a clade of protostomes or a clade of coelomates.

N2  - The recent colonization of North America by Drosophila subobscura has provided a great opportunity to analyze a colonization process from the beginning. A comparative study using 10 microsatellite loci was conducted for five European and two North American populations. No genetic differentiation between European populations was detected, indicating that gene flow is high among them and that the microsatellites used in the present work represent neutral markers not subject to differentiation due to selection. Extensive reduction in the number of alleles and a significant decrease in heterozygosity in colonizing populations were detected that could be explained by the founder effect and a subsequent quick but not infinite expansion. Assuming that all alleles present in the colonized area were carried by the sample of colonizers, we estimated that most probably 4-11 individuals expanded in the new area. FST and the chord distance measures reflect the colonization process more accurately, since drift has been the major force in differentiating the Old and New World populations, and thus other measures considering allele size differences, such as RhoST and δμ, are less reliable for studying nonequilibrium populations. Finally, our results were consistent with the two-phase microsatellite mutational model, indicating that most alleles are generated by gain or loss of a repeat unit, while some alleles originate by more complex mutations.

N2  - Asymmetrical patterns of amino acid substitution in proteins of organisms living at moderate and high temperatures (mesophiles and thermophiles, respectively) are generally taken to indicate selection favoring different amino acids at different temperatures due to their biochemical properties. If that were the case, comparisons of different pairs of mesophilic and thermophilic taxa would exhibit similar patterns of substitutional asymmetry. A previous comparison of mesophilic versus thermophilic Methanococcus with mesophilic versus thermophilic Bacillus revealed several pairs of amino acids for which one amino acid was favored in thermophilic Bacillus and the other was favored in thermophilic Methanococcus. Most of this could be explained by the higher G+C content of the DNA of thermophilic Bacillus, a phenomenon not seen in the Methanococcus comparison. Here, I compared the mesophilic bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans and its thermophilic relative Thermus thermophilus, which are similar in G+C content. Of the 190 pairs of amino acids, 83 exhibited significant substitutional asymmetry, consistent with the pervasive effects of selection. Most of these significantly asymmetrical pairs of amino acids were asymmetrical in the direction predicted from the Methanococcus data, consistent with thermal adaptation resulting from universal biochemical properties of the amino acids. However, 12 pairs of amino acids exhibited asymmetry significantly different from and in the opposite direction of that found in the Methanococcus comparison, and 21 pairs of amino acids exhibited asymmetry that was significantly different from that found in the Bacillus comparison and could not be explained by the greater G+C content in thermophilic Bacillus. This suggests that selection due to universal biochemical properties of the amino acids and differences in G+C content are not the only causes of substitutional asymmetry between mesophiles and thermophiles. Instead, selection on taxon-specific properties of amino acids, such as their metabolic cost, may play a role in causing asymmetrical patterns of substitution.

N2  - The aim of this work was to study the relationship between structure conservation and sequence divergence in protein evolution. To this end, we developed a model of structurally constrained protein evolution (SCPE) in which trial sequences, generated by random mutations at gene level, are selected against departure from a reference three-dimensional structure. Since at the mutational level SCPE is completely unbiased, any emergent sequence pattern will be due exclusively to structural constraints. In this first report, it is shown that SCPE correctly predicts the characteristic hexapeptide motif of the left-handed parallel β helix (LβH) domain of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferases (LpxA).

N2  - The human genome is divided into isochores, large stretches (>>300 kb) of genomic DNA with more or less consistent GC content. Mutational/neutralist and selectionist models have been put forward to explain their existence. A major criticism of the mutational models is that they cannot account for the higher GC content at fourfold-redundant silent sites within exons (GC4) than in flanking introns (GCi). Indeed, it has been asserted that it is hard to envisage a mutational bias explanation, as it is difficult to see how repair enzymes might act differently in exons and their flanking introns. However, this rejection, we note, ignores the effects of transposable elements (TEs), which are a major component of introns and tend to cause them to have a GC content different from (usually lower than) that dictated by point mutational processes alone. As TEs tend not to insert at the extremities of introns, this model predicts that GC content at the extremities of introns should be more like that at GC4 than are the intronic interiors. This we show to be true. The model also correctly predicts that small introns should have a composition more like that at GC4 than large introns. We conclude that the logic of the previous rejection of neutralist models is unsafe.

N2  - We present a model and methodology for the maximum-likelihood analysis of pairwise alignments of DNA sequences in which two genes are encoded in overlapping reading frames. In the model for the substitution process, the instantaneous rates of substitution are allowed to depend on the nucleotides occupying the sites in a neighborhood of the site subject to substitution at the instant of the substitution. By defining the neighborhood of a site to extend over all sites in the codons in both reading frames to which a site belongs, constraints imposed by the genetic code in both reading frames can be taken into account. Due to the dependency of the instantaneous rates of substitution on the states at neighboring sites, the transition probability between sequences does not factorize and therefore cannot be obtained directly. We present a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure for obtaining the ratio of two transition probabilities between two sequences under the model considered, and we describe how maximum-likelihood parameter estimation and likelihood ratio tests can be performed using the procedure. We describe how the expected numbers of different types of substitutions in the shared history of two sequences can be calculated, and we use the described model and methodology in an analysis of a pairwise alignment of two hepatitis B sequences in which two genes are encoded in overlapping frames. Finally, we present an extended model, together with a simpler approximate estimation procedure, and use this to test the adequacy of the former model.

N2  - The order Rodentia contains half of all extant mammal species, and from an evolutionary standpoint, there are persistent controversies surrounding the monophyly of the order, divergence dates for major lineages, and relationships among families. Exons of growth hormone receptor (GHR) and breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA1) genes were sequenced for a wide diversity of rodents and other mammals and combined with sequences of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene and previously published sequences of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Rodents exhibit rates of amino acid replacement twice those observed for nonrodents, and this rapid rate of evolution influences estimates of divergence dates. Based on GHR sequences, monophyly is supported, with the estimated divergence between hystricognaths and most sciurognaths dating to about 75 MYA. Most estimated dates of divergence are consistent with the fossil record, including a date of 23 MYA for Mus-Rattus divergence. These dates are considerably later than those derived from some other molecular studies. Among combined and separate analyses of the various gene sequences, moderate to strong support was found for several clades. GHR appears to have greater resolving power than do 12S or vWF. Despite its complete unresponsiveness to growth hormone, Cavia (and other hystricognaths) exhibits a conservative rate of change in the intracellular domain of GHR.

N2  - Codon usage varies both between organisms and between different genes in the same organism. This observation has been used as a basis for earlier work in identifying highly expressed and horizontally transferred genes in Escherichia coli. In this work, we applied Kohonen's self-organizing map to analysis of the codon usage pattern of the Escherichia coli, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Haemophilus influenzae Rd., Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Pyrococcus horikoshii genomes for evidence of highly expressed genes and horizontally transferred genes. All of the analyzed genomes had a clear category of horizontally transferred genes, and their apparent percentages ranged from 7.7% to 21.4%. The apparent percentage of highly expressed genes ranges from 0% to 11.8%. A clustering of average codon usage of main gene categories of the seven genomes showed an interesting mixing of gene classes in four thermophilic/hyperthermophilic organisms, A. aeolicus, A. fulgidus, M. thermoautotrophicum, and P. horikoshii, which suggests possible origins of their horizontally transferred genes as well as the need for adaptation to a specific environment. Further classification of the three gene categories in E. coli and H. influenzae according to gene function revealed that genes involved in communication (such as regulation and cell process) and structure (cell structure and structural proteins) are more likely to be horizontally transferred than are genes involved in information (transcription, translation, and related processes) and in some groups of energy (such as energy metabolism and carbon compound catabolism).

N2  - Genes involved in male fertility are potential targets for sexual selection, and their evolution may play a role in reproductive isolation and speciation. Here we describe a new Drosophila melanogaster gene, ocnus (ocn), that encodes a protein abundant in testes nuclear extracts. RT-PCR indicates that ocn transcription is limited to males and is specific to testes. ocn shares homology with another testis-specific gene, janusB (janB), and is located just distal to janB on chromosome 3. The two genes also share homology with the adjacent janusA (janA) gene, suggesting that multiple duplication events have occurred within this region of the genome. We cloned and sequenced these three genes from species of the D. melanogaster species subgroup. Phylogenetic analysis based on protein-encoding sequences predicts a duplication pattern of janA → janA janB → janA janB ocn, with the latter event occurring after the divergence of the D. melanogaster and Drosophila obscura species groups. We found significant heterogeneity in the rates of evolution among the three genes within the D. melanogaster species subgroup as measured by the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions, suggesting that diversification of gene function followed each duplication event and that each gene evolved under different selective constraints. All three genes showed faster rates of evolution than genes encoding proteins with metabolic function. These results are consistent with previous studies that have detected an increased rate of evolution in genes with reproductive function.

T1  - A New Theory of Phylogeny Inference Through Construction of Multidimensional Vector Space

N2  - Here, a new theory of molecular phylogeny is developed in a multidimensional vector space (MVS). The molecular evolution is represented as a successive splitting of branch vectors in the MVS. The end points of these vectors are the extant species and indicate the specific directions reflected by their individual histories of evolution in the past. This representation makes it possible to infer the phylogeny (evolutionary histories) from the spatial positions of the end points. Search vectors are introduced to draw out the groups of species distributed around them. These groups are classified according to the nearby order of branches with them. A law of physics is applied to determine the species positions in the MVS. The species are regarded as the particles moving in time according to the equation of motion, finally falling into the lowest-energy state in spite of their randomly distributed initial condition. This falling into the ground state results in the construction of an MVS in which the relative distances between two particles are equal to the substitution distances. The species positions are obtained prior to the phylogeny inference. Therefore, as the number of species increases, the species vectors can be more specific in an MVS of a larger size, such that the vector analysis gives a more stable and reliable topology. The efficacy of the present method was examined by using computer simulations of molecular evolution in which all the branch- and end-point sequences of the trees are known in advance. In the phylogeny inference from the end points with 100 multiple data sets, the present method consistently reconstructed the correct topologies, in contrast to standard methods. In applications to 185 vertebrates in the α-hemoglobin, the vector analysis drew out the two lineage groups of birds and mammals. A core member of the mammalian radiation appeared at the base of the mammalian lineage. Squamates were isolated from the bird lineage to compose the outgroup, while the other living reptilians were directly coupled with birds without forming any sister groups. This result is in contrast to the morphological phylogeny and is also different from those of recent molecular analyses.

N2  - Studies of neutrally evolving sequences suggest that differences in eukaryotic genome sizes result from different rates of DNA loss. However, very few pseudogenes have been identified in microbial species, and the processes whereby genes and genomes deteriorate in bacteria remain largely unresolved. The typhus-causing agent, Rickettsia prowazekii, is exceptional in that as much as 24% of its 1.1-Mb genome consists of noncoding DNA and pseudogenes. To test the hypothesis that the noncoding DNA in the R. prowazekii genome represents degraded remnants of ancestral genes, we systematically examined all of the identified pseudogenes and their flanking sequences in three additional Rickettsia species. Consistent with the hypothesis, we observe sequence similarities between genes and pseudogenes in one species and intergenic DNA in another species. We show that the frequencies and average sizes of deletions are larger than insertions in neutrally evolving pseudogene sequences. Our results suggest that inactivated genetic material in the Rickettsia genomes deteriorates spontaneously due to a mutation bias for deletions and that the noncoding sequences represent DNA in the final stages of this degenerative process.

N2  - Endogenous retrovirus-like elements characterizable by a leucine tRNA primer (ERV-Ls) are reiterated genomic sequences known to be widespread in mammals, including humans. They may have arisen from an ancestral foamy virus-like element by successful germ line infection followed by copy number expansion. However, among mammals, only primates and rodents have thus far exhibited high copy number amplification and sequence diversification. Conventionally, empirical studies of proviral amplification and diversification have been limited to extant species, but taxa having good Quaternary fossil records could potentially be investigated using the techniques of "ancient" DNA research. To examine evolutionary parameters of ERV-Ls across both time and taxa, we characterized this proviral class in the extinct woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) and living elephants, as well as extant members of the larger clade to which they belong (Uranotheria, a group containing proboscideans, sirenians, hyraxes, and their extinct relatives). Ungulates and carnivores previously analyzed demonstrated low copy numbers of ERV-L sequences, and thus it was expected that uranotheres should as well. Here, we show that all uranothere taxa exhibit unexpectedly numerous and diverse ERV-L sequence complements, indicating active expansion within this group of lineages. Selection is the most parsimonious explanation for observed differences in ERV-L distribution and frequency, with relative success being reflected in the persistence of certain elements over a variety of sampled time depths (as can be observed by comparing sequences from fossil and extant elephantid samples).

N2  - TRAS1 is a non-LTR retrotransposon inserted specifically into the telomeric repeat (TTAGG)n in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. To characterize the evolutionary origin of TRAS-like elements, we identified seven TRAS families (TRAS3, TRAS4, TRAS5, TRAS6, TRASY, TRASZ, and TRASW) from B. mori and four elements from two Lepidoptera, Dictyoploca japonica (TRASDJ) and Samia cynthia ricini (TRASSC3, TRASSC4, and TRASSC9). More than 2,000 copies of various Bombyx TRAS elements accumulated within (TTAGG)n sequences as unusual but orderly tandem repeats. The 5' and 3' regions were highly conserved within each class of Bombyx TRAS elements without truncation. This suggests that distinct classes of TRAS have been maintained independently by retrotransposition into (TTAGG)n. The phylogenetic tree of site-specific retroelements showed that nine TRAS families in Lepidoptera constitute a single phylogenetic group that is closely related to the R1 family that inserts specifically into arthropod 28S rDNA. The higher amino acid sequence identity from endonuclease (EN) to reverse transcriptase (RT) domains between TRAS groups (about 37%-70%) than among TRAS elements and R1Bm (about 25%-30%), may reflect the presence of some DNA structure responsible for their target specificity. Sequence comparison from EN to RT domains among non-LTR elements revealed several regions conserved only within TRAS elements. We found a highly conserved region that resembles the Myb-like DNA-binding structure, between the EN and RT domains. These regions may be involved in site-specific integration of TRAS elements into the (TTAGG)n telomeric repeats.

N2  - The complete arrangement of genes in the mitochondrial (mt) genome is known for 12 species of insects, and part of the gene arrangement in the mt genome is known for over 300 other species of insects. The arrangement of genes in the mt genome is very conserved in insects studied, since all of the protein-coding and rRNA genes and most of the tRNA genes are arranged in the same way. We sequenced the entire mt genome of the wallaby louse, Heterodoxus macropus, which is 14,670 bp long and has the 37 genes typical of animals and some noncoding regions. The largest noncoding region is 73 bp long (93% A+T), and the second largest is 47 bp long (92% A+T). Both of these noncoding regions seem to be able to form stem-loop structures. The arrangement of genes in the mt genome of this louse is unlike that of any other animal studied. All tRNA genes have moved and/or inverted relative to the ancestral gene arrangement of insects, which is present in the fruit fly Drosophila yakuba. At least nine protein-coding genes (atp6, atp8, cox2, cob, nad1-nad3, nad5, and nad6) have moved; moreover, four of these genes (atp6, atp8, nad1, and nad3) have inverted. The large number of gene rearrangements in the mt genome of H. macropus is unprecedented for an arthropod.

N2  - Here, a model allowing covarion-like evolution of DNA sequences is introduced. In contrast to standard representation of the distribution of evolutionary rates, this model allows the site-specific rate to vary between lineages. This is achieved by adding as few as two parameters to the widely used among-site rate variation model, namely, (1) the proportion of sites undergoing rate changes and (2) the rate of rate change. This model is implemented in the likelihood framework, allowing parameter estimation, comparison of models, and tree reconstruction. An application to ribosomal RNA sequences suggests that covarions (i.e., site-specific rate changes) play an important role in the evolution of these molecules. Neglecting them results in a severe underestimate of the variance of rates across sites. It has, however, little influence on the estimation of ancestral G+C contents obtained from a nonhomogeneous model, or on the resulting inferences about the evolution of thermophyly. This theoretical effort should be useful for the study of protein adaptation, which presumably proceeds in a typical covarion-like manner.

N2  - Slightly deleterious mutations are expected to fix at relatively higher rates in small populations than in large populations. Support for this prediction of the nearly-neutral theory of molecular evolution comes from many cases in which lineages inferred to differ in long-term average population size have different rates of nonsynonymous substitution. However, in most of these cases, the lineages differ in many other ways as well, leaving open the possibility that some factor other than population size might have caused the difference in substitution rates. We compared synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions in the mitochondrial cyt b and ND2 genes of nine closely related island and mainland lineages of ducks and doves. We assumed that island taxa had smaller average population sizes than those of their mainland sister taxa for most of the time since they were established. In all nine cases, more nonsynonymous substitutions occurred on the island branch, but synonymous substitutions showed no significant bias. As in previous comparisons of this kind, the lineages with smaller populations might differ in other respects that tend to increase rates of nonsynonymous substitution, but here such differences are expected to be slight owing to the relatively recent origins of the island taxa. An examination of changes to apparently "preferred" and "unpreferred" synonymous codons revealed no consistent difference between island and mainland lineages

N2  - The analysis of 460 kb of genomic sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome III allowed us to identify two new transposable elements named AtC1 and AtC2. AtC1 shows identical long terminal repeats (LTRs) and all the structural features characteristic of the copia-like active elements. AtC2 is also a full copia-like element, but a putative stop codon in the open reading frame (ORF) would produce a truncated protein. In order to identify the copia-like fraction of the A. thaliana genome, a careful computer-based analysis of the available sequences (which correspond to 92% of the genome) was performed. Approximately 300 nonredundant copia-like sequences homologous to AtC1 and AtC2 were detected, which showed an extreme heterogeneity in size and degree of conservation. This number of copies would correspond to approximately 1% of the A. thaliana genome. Seventy-one sequences were selected for further analysis, with 23 of them being full complete elements. Five corresponded to previously described ones, and the remaining ones, named AtC3 to AtC18 are new elements described in this work. Most of these elements presented a putative functional ORF, nearly identical LTRs, and the other elements necessary for retrotransposon activity. Phylogenetic trees, supported by high bootstrap values, indicated that these 23 elements could be considered separate families. In turn, these 23 families could be clustered into six major lineages, named copia I-VI. Most of the 71 analyzed sequences clustered into these six main clades. The widespread presence of these copia-like superfamilies throughout plant genomes is discussed.

N2  - The blind use of models of nucleotide substitution in evolutionary analyses is a common practice in the viral community. Typically, a simple model of evolution like the Kimura two-parameter model is used for estimating genetic distances and phylogenies, either because other authors have used it or because it is the default in various phylogenetic packages. Using two statistical approaches to model fitting, hierarchical likelihood ratio tests and the Akaike information criterion, we show that different viral data sets are better explained by different models of evolution. We demonstrate our results with the analysis of HIV-1 sequences from a hierarchy of samples; sequences within individuals, individuals within subtypes, and subtypes within groups. We also examine results for three different gene regions: gag, pol, and env. The Kimura two-parameter model was not selected as the best-fit model for any of these data sets, despite its widespread use in phylogenetic analyses of HIV-1 sequences. Furthermore, the model complexity increased with increasing sequence divergence. Finally, the molecular-clock hypothesis was rejected in most of the data sets analyzed, throwing into question clock-based estimates of divergence times for HIV-1. The importance of models in evolutionary analyses and their repercussions on the derived conclusions are discussed.

N2  - Rhizobia are soil bacteria able to fix atmospheric nitrogen in symbiosis with leguminous plants. In response to a signal cascade coded by genes of both symbiotic partners, a specific plant organ, the nodule, is formed. Rhizobial nodulation (nod) genes trigger nodule formation through the synthesis of Nod factors, a family of chitolipooligosaccharides that are specifically recognized by the host plant at the first stages of the nodulation process. Here, we present the organization and sequence of the common nod genes from Rhizobium galegae, a symbiotic member of the Rhizobiaceae. This species has an intriguing phylogenetic position, being symbiotic among pathogenic agrobacteria, which induce tumors instead of nodules in plant shoots or roots. This apparent incongruence raises special interest in the origin of the symbiotic apparatus of R. galegae. Our analysis of DNA sequence data indicated that the organization of the common nod gene region of R. galegae was similar to that of Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum, with nodIJ downstream of nodABC and the regulatory nodD gene closely linked to the common nod operon. Moreover, phylogenetic analyses of the nod gene sequences showed a close relationship especially between the common nodA sequences of R. galegae, S. meliloti, and R. leguminosarum biovars viciae and trifolii. This relationship in structure and sequence contrasts with the phylogeny based on 16S rRNA, which groups R. galegae close to agrobacteria and separate from most other rhizobia. The topology of the nodA tree was similar to that of the corresponding host plant tree. Taken together, these observations indicate that lateral nod gene transfer occurred from fast-growing rhizobia toward agrobacteria, after which the symbiotic apparatus evolved under host plant constraint.

N2  - We evaluated the effects of selection on the molecular evolution of the functional domains of the mammalian cytochrome b gene as it relates to physicochemical properties shown to correlate with rates of amino acid replacement. Two groups of mammals were considered: pocket gophers of the rodent family Geomyidae, and cetaceans and ungulates of the monophyletic taxon Cetartiodactyla. Several characteristics of cytochrome b evolution were common to both mammal groups. The evolution of the matrix domain reflected the region's relative lack of function. Goodness of fit to neutral expectations indicated that external influences have had very little effect on the evolution of the matrix, although in some cases conservative and moderate changes have been favored. Although rates of synonymous nucleotide substitution have been relatively high, the transmembrane domain exhibited poor goodness of fit to neutral expectations. However, the evolution of the transmembrane domain has been constrained by negative selection, allowing a preponderance of conservative and moderate amino acid replacements. We hypothesize that a high rate of substitution is maintained in spite of negative selection because the codons of the transmembrane coding region are predisposed to conservative changes in all amino acid properties. The evolutionary patterns of the intermembrane domain in pocket gophers and cetartiodactyls, however, were very different. Changes inferred from the pocket gopher phylogenetic tree exhibited a significant fit to neutral expectations for each of the amino acid properties. Changes inferred from the cetartiodactyl tree exhibited significant fit to neutral expectations for polarity and isoelectric point, but not for composition, molecular volume, polar requirement, or hydropathy. In each case, lack of fit was due to selection that promoted conservative or moderate change, with the noteworthy exception of polar requirement. We detected an unexpectedly large change in polar requirement (from aspartic acid to threonine) in two separate lineages (Camelus bactrianus and all cetaceans) at amino acid position 159. This inferred change occurred in a region of the cyt-b protein that directly interacts with external surface proteins of the cytochrome bc1 complex and resulted in a reversion to a more common character state in vertebrates.

N2  - We compared sex chromosomal and autosomal regions of similar GC contents and found that the human Y chromosome contains nine times as many full-length (FL) ancestral LINE-1 (L1) elements per megabase as do autosomes and that the X chromosome contains three times as many. In addition, both sex chromosomes contain a ca. twofold excess of elements that are >500 bp but not long enough to be capable of autonomous replication. In contrast, the autosomes are not deficient in short (<500 bp) L1 elements or SINE elements relative to the sex chromosomes. Since neither the Y nor the X chromosome, when present in males, can be cleared of deleterious genetic loci by recombination, we conclude that most FL L1s were deleterious and thus subject to purifying selection. Comparison between nonrecombining and recombining regions of autosome 21 supported this conclusion. We were able to identify a subset of loci in the human DNA database that once contained active L1 elements, and we found by using the polymerase chain reaction that 72% of them no longer contain L1 elements in a representative of each of eight different ethnic groups. Genetic damage produced by both L1 retrotransposition and ectopic (nonallelic) recombination between L1 elements could provide the basis for their negative selection.

N2  - Heterogeneous DNA substitution rates were found in the 18S-26S nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and external transcribed spacer (ETS) regions of Sidalcea (Malvaceae), a putatively young genus of annuals and perennials. The majority of comparisons revealed that the annual species had significantly higher molecular evolutionary rates than the perennials, whereas rates were consistently homogenous between obligate annual species. These findings led us to conclude that generation time or possibly another biological factor distinguishing annuals and perennials has influenced rates of molecular evolution in Sidalcea. The congruence of relative-rate test results across both spacer regions reinforced the association between life history and rate of rDNA evolution across lineages of checker mallows. Evolutionary rate variation within perennials mainly involved three basally divergent lineages. The faster rate in one lineage, Sidalcea stipularis, compared with other perennials may be the result of genetic drift in the only known, small, population. The other two basally divergent lineages had slower evolutionary rates compared with the remaining perennials; possible explanations for these differences include rate-reducing effects of a suffrutescent (rather than herbaceous) habit and seed dormancy.

N2  - Growth hormone (GH) evolution is very conservative among mammals, except for primates and ruminant artiodactyls. In fact, most known mammalian GH sequences differ from the inferred ancestral mammalian sequence by only a few amino acids. In contrast, the human GH sequence differs from the inferred ancestral sequence by 59 amino acids. However, it is not known when this rapid evolution of GH occurred during primate evolution or whether it was due to positive selection. Also, human growth hormone receptor (GHR) displays species specificity; i.e., it can interact only with human (or rhesus monkey) GH, not with nonprimate GHs. The species specificity of human GHR is largely due to the Leu→Arg change at position 43, and it has been hypothesized that this change must have been preceded by the His→Asp change at position 171 of GH. Is this hypothesis true? And when did these changes occur? To address the above issues, we sequenced GH and GHR genes in prosimians and simians. Our data supported the above hypothesis and revealed that the species specificity of human GHR actually emerged in the common ancestor of Old World primates, but the transitional phase still persists in New World monkeys. Our data showed that the rapid evolution of primate GH occurred during a relatively short period (in the common ancestor of higher primates) and that the rate of change was especially high at functionally important sites, suggesting positive selection. However, the nonsynonymous rate/synonymous rate ratio at these sites was <1, so relaxation of purifying selection might have played a role in the rapid evolution of the GH gene in simians, possibly as a result of multiple gene duplications. Similar to GH, GHR displayed an accelerated rate of evolution in primates. Our data revealed proportionally more amino acid replacements at the functionally important sites in both GH and GHR in simians but, surprisingly, showed few coincidental replacements of amino acids forming the same intermolecular contacts between the two proteins.

T1  - Loss of Transposase-DNA Interaction May Underlie the Divergence of mariner Family Transposable Elements and the Ability of More than One mariner to Occupy the Same Genome

N2  - Mariners are a large family of eukaryotic DNA-mediated transposable elements that move via a cut-and-paste mechanism. Several features of the evolutionary history of mariners are unusual. First, they appear to undergo horizontal transfer commonly between species on an evolutionary timescale. They can do this because they are able to transpose using only their own self-encoded transposase and not host-specific factors. One consequence of this phenomenon is that more than one kind of mariner can be present in the same genome. We hypothesized that two mariners occupying the same genome would not interact. We tested the limits of mariner interactions using an in vitro transposition system, purified mariner transposases, and DNAse I footprinting. Only mariner elements that were very closely related to each other (ca. 84% identity) cross-mobilized, and then inefficiently. Because of the dramatic suppression of transposition between closely related elements, we propose that to isolate elements functionally, only minor changes might be necessary between elements, in both inverted terminal repeat and amino acid sequence. We further propose a mechanism to explain mariner diversification based on this phenomenon.

N2  - In eukaryotic cells, the majority of proteins are degraded via the ATP-dependent ubiquitin/26S proteasome pathway. The proteasome is the proteolytic component of the pathway. It is a very large complex with a mass of around 2.5 MDa, consisting of at least 62 proteins encoded by 31 genes. The eukaryotic proteasome has evolved from a simpler archaebacterial form, similar in structure but containing only three different peptides. One of these peptides is an ATPase belonging to the AAA (Triple-A) family of ATPases. Gene duplication and diversification has resulted in six paralogous ATPases being present in the eukaryotic proteasome. While sequence analysis studies clearly show that the six eukaryotic proteasomal ATPases have evolved from the single archaebacterial proteasomal ATPase, the deep node structures of the phylogenetic constructions lack resolution. Incorporating physical data to provide support for alternative phylogenetic hypotheses, we have constructed a model of a possible evolutionary history of the proteasomal ATPases.

N2  - Host specificity of symbionts is considered an important factor associated with sympatric speciation. Here, we examine host specificity and the degree of host-associated speciation in the barnacle Savignium milleporum, an obligate symbiont of the hydrocoral Millepora (the "fire coral"). Little morphological variability was revealed between barnacles collected from two morphs of the hydrocoral Millepora dichotoma (encrusting or branching) or from its congener Millepora platyphylla, but a molecular analysis revealed an unexpected pattern of DNA sequence divergence. The sequences of the 12S mitochondrial rDNA were nearly identical within each of the three barnacle populations (average sequence divergence <1%), and the sequences obtained for barnacles collected from the two different morphs of M. dichotoma differed considerably (ca. 9% average sequence divergence). However, S. milleporum collected from M. platyphylla were nearly identical to the barnacles from the branching M. dichotoma (<0.5% average sequence divergence). The pattern of speciation demonstrated by Savignium barnacles indicates the gradual colonization of similar hosts (i.e., sequential evolution), rather then "casual" colonization, as indicated for other systems. If this is indeed so, then symbiont phylogeny should roughly correlate with host phylogeny. Additionally, the data support the "rendezvous host" hypothesis, which invokes the opportunity of both sexes to meet as a major component for which selection favors the costly habit of host specificity.

N2  - It is has been suggested that synonymous codon bias is a consequence of mutation bias in mammals. We tested this hypothesis in humans using single-nucleotide polymorphism data. We found a pattern of polymorphism which was inconsistent with the mutation bias hypothesis in G+C-rich genes. However, the data were consistent with the action of natural selection or biased gene conversion. Similar patterns of polymorphism were also observed in noncoding DNA, suggesting that natural selection or biased gene conversion may affect large tracts of the human genome.

N2  - The quasispecies model of RNA virus evolution differs from those formulated in conventional population genetics in that neutral mutations do not lead to genetic drift of the population, and natural selection acts on the mutant distribution as a whole rather than on individual variants. By computer simulation, we show that this model could be inappropriate for many RNA viruses because the neutral sequence space may be too large to allow the formation of a quasispecies distribution. This view is supported by our analysis of gene sequences from vesicular stomatitis virus, which is considered a prototype RNA virus quasispecies. Our results are relevant to the evolution of RNA systems in general.

N2  - Yeast-like endosymbionts (YLSs) of insects often are restricted to specific hosts and are essential to the host's survival. For example, in planthoppers (Homoptera: Delphacidae), endosymbionts function in sterol utilization and nitrogen recycling for the hosts. Our study, designed to investigate evolutionary changes in the YLS lineage involved in the planthopper association, strongly suggests an origin of the YLSs from within the filamentous ascomycetes (Euascomycetes), not the true yeasts (Saccharomycetes), as their morphology might indicate. During divergence of the planthopper YLSs, dramatic changes would have occurred in the insect-fungus interaction and the fungal morphology that have previously been undescribed in filamentous ascomycetes. Phylogenetic trees were based on individual and combined data sets of 2.6 kb of the nuclear small- and large-subunit ribosomal RNA genes for YLSs from three rice planthoppers (Laodelphax striatellus, Nilaparvata lugens, and Sogatella furcifera) compared with 56 other fungi. Parsimony analysis placed the planthopper YLSs within Cordyceps (Euascomycetes: Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae), a genus of filamentous insects and a few fungal pathogenic ascomycetes. Another YLS species restricted to the aphid Hamiltonaphis styraci (Homoptera: Aphididae) was a sister taxon to the planthopper YLSs. Filamentous insect pathogens (Metarhizium and Beauveria) specific to the same species of insect hosts as the YLSs also formed lineages within the Clavicipitaceae, but these were distinct from the clade comprising YLS species. Trees constrained to include the YLSs in families of the Hypocreales other than the Clavicipitaceae were rejected by the Kishino-Hasegawa test. In addition, the results of this study support a hypothesis of two independent origins of insect-associated YLSs from among filamentous ascomycetes: the planthopper YLSs in the Clavicipitaceae and the YLSs associated with anobiid beetles (Symbiotaphrina species). Several lineages of true yeasts (Saccharomycetes) also formed endosymbiotic associations with beetles, but they were not closely related to either group derived from the filamentous ascomycetes.

N2  - We develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to estimating the posterior distribution of phylogenies based on aligned DNA/RNA sequences under several hierarchical evolutionary models. Using a proper, yet nontruncated and uninformative prior, we demonstrate the advantages of the Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing and estimation in phylogenetics by comparing different models for the infinitesimal rates of change among nucleotides, for the number of rate classes, and for the relationships among branch lengths. We compare the relative probabilities of these models and the appropriateness of a molecular clock using Bayes factors. Our most general model, first proposed by Tamura and Nei, parameterizes the infinitesimal change probabilities among nucleotides (A, G, C, T/U) into six parameters, consisting of three parameters for the nucleotide stationary distribution, two rate parameters for nucleotide transitions, and another parameter for nucleotide transversions. Nested models include the Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano model with equal transition rates and the Kimura model with a uniform stationary distribution and equal transition rates. To illustrate our methods, we examine simulated data, 16S rRNA sequences from 15 contemporary eubacteria, halobacteria, eocytes, and eukaryotes, 9 primates, and the entire HIV genome of 11 isolates. We find that the Kimura model is too restrictive, that the Hasegawa, Kishino, and Yano model can be rejected for some data sets, that there is evidence for more than one rate class and a molecular clock among similar taxa, and that a molecular clock can be rejected for more distantly related taxa.

N2  - The evolutionary expansion of CAG repeats in human triplet expansion disease genes is intriguing because of their deleterious phenotype. In the past, this expansion has been suggested to reflect a broad genomewide expansion of repeats, which would imply that mutational and evolutionary processes acting on repeats differ between species. Here, we tested this hypothesis by analyzing repeat- and flanking-sequence evolution in 28 repeat-containing genes that had been sequenced in humans and mice and by considering overall lengths and distributions of CAG repeats in the two species. We found no evidence that these repeats were longer in humans than in mice. We also found no evidence for preferential accumulation of CAG repeats in the human genome relative to mice from an analysis of the lengths of repeats identified in sequence databases. We then investigated whether sequence properties, such as base and amino acid composition and base substitution rates, showed any relationship to repeat evolution. We found that repeat-containing genes were enriched in certain amino acids, presumably as the result of selection, but that this did not reflect underlying biases in base composition. We also found that regions near repeats showed higher nonsynonymous substitution rates than the remainder of the gene and lower nonsynonymous rates in genes that contained a repeat in both the human and the mouse. Higher rates of nonsynonymous mutation in the neighborhood of repeats presumably reflect weaker purifying selection acting in these regions of the proteins, while the very low rate of nonsynonymous mutation in proteins containing a CAG repeat in both species presumably reflects a high level of purifying selection. Based on these observations, we propose that the mutational processes giving rise to polyglutamine repeats in human and murine proteins do not differ. Instead, we propose that the evolution of polyglutamine repeats in proteins results from an interplay between mutational processes and selection.

N2  - Convergence in nucleotide composition (CNC) in unrelated lineages is a factor potentially affecting the performance of most phylogeny reconstruction methods. Such convergence has deleterious effects because unrelated lineages show similarities due to similar nucleotide compositions and not shared histories. While some methods (such as the LogDet/paralinear distance measure) avoid this pitfall, the amount of convergence in nucleotide composition necessary to deceive other phylogenetic methods has never been quantified. We examined analytically the relationship between convergence in nucleotide composition and the consistency of parsimony as a phylogenetic estimator for four taxa. Our results show that rather extreme amounts of convergence are necessary before parsimony begins to prefer the incorrect tree. Ancillary observations are that (for unweighted Fitch parsimony) transition/transversion bias contributes to the impact of CNC and, for a given amount of CNC and fixed branch lengths, data sets exhibiting substantial site-to-site rate heterogeneity present fewer difficulties than data sets in which rates are homogeneous. We conclude by reexamining a data set originally used to illustrate the problems caused by CNC. Using simulations, we show that in this case the convergence in nucleotide composition alone is insufficient to cause any commonly used methods to fail, and accounting for other evolutionary factors (such as site-to-site rate heterogeneity) can give a correct inference without accounting for CNC.

N2  - Despite intensive study in recent years, large-scale eukaryote phylogeny remains poorly resolved. This is particularly problematic among the groups considered to be potential early branches. In many recent systematic schemes for early eukaryotic evolution, the amitochondriate protists oxymonads and Trimastix have figured prominently, having been suggested as members of many of the putative deep-branching higher taxa. However, they have never before been proposed as close relatives of each other. We amplified, cloned, and sequenced small-subunit ribosomal RNA genes from the oxymonad Pyrsonympha and from several Trimastix isolates. Rigorous phylogenetic analyses indicate that these two protist groups are sister taxa and are not clearly related to any currently established eukaryotic lineages. This surprising result has important implications for our understanding of cellular evolution and high-level eukaryotic phylogeny. Given that Trimastix contains small, electron-dense bodies strongly suspected to be derived mitochondria, this study constitutes the best evidence to date that oxymonads are not primitively amitochondriate. Instead, Trimastix and oxymonads may be useful organisms for investigations into the evolution of the secondary amitochondriate condition. All higher taxa involving either oxymonads or Trimastix may require modification or abandonment. Affected groups include four contemporary taxa given the rank of phylum (Metamonada, Loukozoa, Trichozoa, Percolozoa), and the informal excavate taxa. A new "phylum-level" taxon may be warranted for oxymonads and Trimastix.

N2  - The complete coding region of the yellow (y) gene was sequenced in different Drosophila species. In the species of the melanogaster subgroup (D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. mauritiana, D. yakuba, and D. erecta), this gene is located at the tip of the X chromosome in a region with a strong reduction in recombination rate. In contrast, in D. ananassae (included in the ananassae subgroup of the melanogaster group) and in the obscura group species (D. subobscura, D. madeirensis, D. guanche, and D. pseudoobscura), the y gene is located in regions with normal recombination rates. As predicted by the hitchhiking and background selection models, this change in the recombinational environment affected synonymous divergence in the y-gene-coding region. Estimates of the number of synonymous substitutions per site were much lower between the obscura group species and D. ananassae than between the species of the obscura group and the melanogaster subgroup. In fact, a highly significant increase in the rate of synonymous substitution was detected in all lineages leading to the species of the melanogaster subgroup relative to the D. ananassae lineage. This increase can be explained by a higher fixation rate of mutations from preferred to unpreferred codons (slightly deleterious mutations). The lower codon bias detected in all species of the melanogaster subgroup relative to D. ananassae (or to the obscura group species) would be consistent with this proposal. Therefore, at least in Drosophila, changes in the recombination rate in different lineages might cause deviations of the molecular-clock hypothesis and contribute to the overdispersion of the rate of synonymous substitution. In contrast, the change in the recombinational environment of the y gene has no detectable effect on the rate of amino acid replacement in the Yellow protein.

N2  - We amplified, TA-cloned, and sequenced the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions from single isolates of several cyanobacterial species, Calothrix parietina, Scytonema hyalinum, Coelodesmium wrangelii, Tolypothrix distorta, and a putative new genus (isolates SRS6 and SRS70), to investigate the potential of this DNA sequence for phylogenetic and population genetic studies. All isolates carried ITS regions containing the sequences coding for two tRNA molecules (tRNA and tRNA). We retrieved additional sequences without tRNA features from both C. parietina and S. hyalinum. Furthermore, in S. hyalinum, we found two of these non-tRNA-encoding regions to be identical in length but different in sequence. This is the first report of ITS regions from a single cyanobacterial isolate not only different in configuration, but also, within one configuration, different in sequence. The potential of the ITS region as a tool for studying molecular systematics and population genetics is significant, but the presence of multiple nonidentical rRNA operons poses problems. Multiple nonidentical rRNA operons may impact both studies that depend on comparisons of phylogenetically homologous sequences and those that employ restriction enzyme digests of PCR products. We review current knowledge of the numbers and kinds of 16S-23S ITS regions present across bacterial groups and plastids, and we discuss broad patterns congruent with higher-level systematics of prokaryotes.

N2  - The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is one of the flagship species in worldwide conservation and is of special interest in evolutionary studies due to its taxonomic uniqueness. We sequenced a 236-bp fragment of the mitochondrial D-loop region in a sample of 53 red pandas from two populations in southwestern China. Seventeen polymorphic sites were found, together with a total of 25 haplotypes, indicating a high level of genetic diversity in the red panda. However, no obvious genetic divergence was detected between the Sichuan and Yunnan populations. The consensus phylogenetic tree of the 25 haplotypes was starlike. The pairwise mismatch distribution fitted into a pattern of populations undergoing expansion. Furthermore, Fu's FS test of neutrality was significant for the total population (FS = -7.573), which also suggests a recent population expansion. Interestingly, the effective population size in the Sichuan population was both larger and more stable than that in the Yunnan population, implying a southward expansion from Sichuan to Yunnan.

N2  - We analyzed 10 Y-chromosomal binary markers in 363 males from 8 populations in Northern Europe and 5 Y microsatellites in 346 of these individuals. These populations can be grouped according to cultural, linguistic, or geographical criteria, and the groupings are different in each case. We can therefore ask which criterion best corresponds to the distribution of genetic variation. In an AMOVA analysis using the binary markers, 13% of the Y variation was found between populations, indicating a high level of differentiation within this small area. No significant difference was seen between the traditionally nomadic Saami and the neighboring, historically farming, populations. When the populations were divided into Uralic speakers and Indo-European speakers, 8% of the variation was found between groups, but when they were divided according to geographical location, 14% of the variation was between groups. Geographical factors have thus been the most important in limiting gene flow between these populations, but linguistic differences have also been important in the east.

N2  - Molecular and biochemical genetic analyses have revealed that many marine invertebrate taxa, including some well-studied and presumably cosmopolitan species, are actually complexes of sibling species. When morphological differences are slight and estimated divergence times are old, data suggest either unusually high rates of sequence evolution or long-term morphological stasis. Here, five gene regions (mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I and large-subunit ribosomal 16S rDNA and nuclear ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, and ITS2) were analyzed in four geographic samples of the meiobenthic harpacticoid copepod Cletocamptus deitersi. Molecular sequences revealed four extremely differentiated molecular lineages with unalignable nuclear intergenic spacers and mitochondrial uncorrected divergences reaching 25% (cytochrome oxidase) and 36% (16S rDNA). These levels of divergence are greater than those reported previously for congeneric species in diverse invertebrate taxa, including crustaceans. The nominally intraspecific divergence matches or exceeds the corresponding divergence from a known congener (Cletocamptus helobius). A molecular clock applied to the cytochrome oxidase subunit I data suggests that these lineages split in the Miocene, consistent with the fossil record of a North American Cletocamptus from the same period. Morphological differences among the major lineages are subtle but congruent with the patterns of genetic differentiation. Our conclusion, based on concordant patterns of variation in two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene regions, as well as morphological observations, is that C. deitersi in North America is composed of at least four separate species by the genealogical concordance, phylogenetic, and morphological-species criteria. Alternative explanations for the deep phylogenetic nodes and apparent morphological stasis, including high rates of sequence evolution, balancing selection, and genetic signatures of historical events, are considered unlikely.

N2  - We analyze the performance of quartet methods in phylogenetic reconstruction. These methods first compute four-taxon trees (4-trees) and then use a combinatorial algorithm to infer a phylogeny that respects the inferred 4-trees as much as possible. Quartet puzzling (QP) is one of the few methods able to take weighting of the 4-trees, which is inferred by maximum likelihood, into account. QP seems to be widely used. We present weight optimization (WO), a new algorithm which is also based on weighted 4-trees. WO is faster and offers better theoretical guarantees than QP. Moreover, computer simulations indicate that the topological accuracy of WO is less dependent on the shape of the correct tree. However, although the performance of WO is better overall than that of QP, it is still less efficient than traditional phylogenetic reconstruction approaches based on pairwise evolutionary distances or maximum likelihood. This is likely related to long-branch attraction, a phenomenon to which quartet methods are very sensitive, and to inappropriate use of the initial results (weights) obtained by maximum likelihood for every quartet.

T1  - The Phylogenetic Analysis of Variable-Length Sequence Data: Elongation Factor-1α Introns in European Populations of the Parasitoid Wasp Genus Pauesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae)

N2  - Elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) is a highly conserved nuclear coding gene that can be used to investigate recent divergences due to the presence of rapidly evolving introns. However, a universal feature of intron sequences is that even closely related species exhibit insertion and deletion events, which cause variation in the lengths of the sequences. Indels are frequently rich in evolutionary information, but most investigators ignore sites that fall within these variable regions, largely because the analytical tools and theory are not well developed. We examined this problem in the taxonomically problematic parasitoid wasp genus Pauesia (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae) using congruence as a criterion for assessing a range of methods for aligning such variable-length EF-1α intron sequences. These methods included distance- and parsimony-based multiple-alignment programs (CLUSTAL W and MALIGN), direct optimization (POY), and two "by eye" alignment strategies. Furthermore, with one method (CLUSTAL W) we explored in detail the robustness of results to changes in the gap cost parameters. Phenetic-based alignments ("by eye" and CLUSTAL W) appeared, under our criterion, to perform as well as more readily defensible, but computationally more demanding, methods. In general, all of our alignment and tree-building strategies recovered the same basic topological structure, which means that an underlying phylogenetic signal remained regardless of the strategy chosen. However, several relationships between clades were sensitive both to alignment and to tree-building protocol. Further alignments, considering only sequences belonging to the same group, allowed us to infer a range of phylogenetic relationships that were highly robust to tree-building protocol. By comparing these topologies with those obtained by varying the CLUSTAL parameters, we generated the distribution area of congruence and taxonomic compatibility. Finally, we present the first robust estimate of the European Pauesia phylogeny by using two EF-1α introns and 38 taxa (plus 3 outgroups). This estimate conflicts markedly with the traditional subgeneric classification. We recommend that this classification be abandoned, and we propose a series of monophyletic species groups.

N2  - Given the number of nucleotide substitutions between two species (K) and the substitution rate ν, the expectation of the corresponding divergence time is usually calculated as K/(2ν). This is strictly true only if ν is regarded as a constant because the ratio of two random variables, such as K/(2ν), has distributional properties different from those of the distribution of K. Therefore, both the mean and any confidence interval for divergence times are unknown in this situation. We model the distribution of K and ν using the Gamma distribution and calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval for the corresponding divergence time. These calculations are compared with results obtained by bootstrapping sequence data from the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and its relatives. We show that for nonoverlapping pairs of phylogenetic distances, our method approaches the bootstrap results very closely. In contrast, regarding the mutation rate as a constant leads to strong underestimation of the confidence interval. An implementation of our method of computing divergence times is accessible through a web interface at http://www.soft.ice.mpg.de/cite.

N2  - Complete chromosome/genome sequences available from humans, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were analyzed for the occurrence of mono-, di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats. In all of the genomes studied, dinucleotide repeat stretches tended to be longer than other repeats. Additionally, tetranucleotide repeats in humans and trinucleotide repeats in Drosophila also seemed to be longer. Although the trends for different repeats are similar between different chromosomes within a genome, the density of repeats may vary between different chromosomes of the same species. The abundance or rarity of various di- and trinucleotide repeats in different genomes cannot be explained by nucleotide composition of a sequence or potential of repeated motifs to form alternative DNA structures. This suggests that in addition to nucleotide composition of repeat motifs, characteristic DNA replication/repair/recombination machinery might play an important role in the genesis of repeats. Moreover, analysis of complete genome coding DNA sequences of Drosophila, C. elegans, and yeast indicated that expansions of codon repeats corresponding to small hydrophilic amino acids are tolerated more, while strong selection pressures probably eliminate codon repeats encoding hydrophobic and basic amino acids. The locations and sequences of all of the repeat loci detected in genome sequences and coding DNA sequences are available at http://www.ncl-india.org/ssr and could be useful for further studies.

N2  - The assumption that animal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) does not undergo homologous recombination is based on indirect evidence, yet it has had an important influence on our understanding of mtDNA repair and mutation accumulation (and thus mitochondrial disease and aging) and on biohistorical inferences made from population data. Recently, several studies have suggested recombination in primate mtDNA on the basis of patterns of frequency distribution and linkage associations of mtDNA mutations in human populations, but others have failed to produce similar evidence. Here, we provide direct evidence for homologous mtDNA recombination in mussels, where heteroplasmy is the rule in males. Our results indicate a high rate of mtDNA recombination. Coupled with the observation that mammalian mitochondria contain the enzymes needed for the catalysis of homologous recombination, these findings suggest that animal mtDNA molecules may recombine regularly and that the extent to which this generates new haplotypes may depend only on the frequency of biparental inheritance of the mitochondrial genome. This generalization must, however, await evidence from animal species with typical maternal mtDNA inheritance.

N2  - We examined the diversity, evolution, and genomic organization of retroelements in a wide range of gymnosperms. In total, 165 fragments of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene domain were sequenced from PCR products using newly designed primers for gypsy-like retrotransposons and well-known primers for copia-like retrotransposons; representatives of long interspersed nuclear element (LINE) retroposons were also found. Gypsy and copia-like retroelements are a major component of the gymnosperm genome, and in situ hybridization showed that individual element families were widespread across the chromosomes, consistent with dispersion and amplification via an RNA intermediate. Most of the retroelement families were widely distributed among the gymnosperms, including species with wide taxonomic separation from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. When the gymnosperm sequences were analyzed together with retroelements from other species, the monophyletic origin of plant copia, gypsy, and LINE groups was well supported, with an additional clade including badnaviral and other, probably virus-related, plant sequences as well as animal and fungal gypsy elements. Plant retroelements showed high diversity within the phylogenetic trees of both copia and gypsy RT domains, with, for example, retroelement sequences from Arabidopsis thaliana being present in many supported groupings. No primary branches divided major taxonomic clades such as angiosperms, monocotyledons, gymnosperms, or conifers or (based on smaller samples) ferns, Gnetales, or Sphenopsida (Equisetum), suggesting that much of the existing diversity was present early in plant evolution, or perhaps that horizontal transfer of sequences has occurred. Within the phylogenetic trees for both gypsy and copia, two clearly monophyletic gymnosperm/conifer clades were revealed, providing evidence against recent horizontal transfer. The results put the evolution of the large and relatively conserved genome structure of gymnosperms into the context of the diversity of other groups of plants.

N2  - We examined 43 biallelic polymorphisms on the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome (NRY) in 50 human populations encompassing a total of 2,858 males to study the geographic structure of Y-chromosome variation. Patterns of NRY diversity varied according to geographic region and method/level of comparison. For example, populations from Central Asia had the highest levels of heterozygosity, while African populations exhibited a higher level of mean pairwise differences among haplotypes. At the global level, 36% of the total variance of NRY haplotypes was attributable to differences among populations (i.e., ϕST = 0.36). When a series of AMOVA analyses was performed on different groupings of the 50 populations, high levels of among-groups variance (ϕCT) were found between Africans, Native Americans, and a single group containing all 36 remaining populations. The same three population groupings formed distinct clusters in multidimensional scaling plots. A nested cladistic analysis (NCA) demonstrated that both population structure processes (recurrent gene flow restricted by isolation by distance and long-distance dispersals) and population history events (contiguous range expansions and long-distance colonizations) were instrumental in explaining this tripartite division of global NRY diversity. As in our previous analyses of smaller NRY data sets, the NCA detected a global contiguous range expansion out of Africa at the level of the total cladogram. Our new results support a general scenario in which, after an early out-of-Africa range expansion, global-scale patterns of NRY variation were mainly influenced by migrations out of Asia. Two other notable findings of the NCA were (1) Europe as a "receiver" of intercontinental signals primarily from Asia, and (2) the large number of intracontinental signals within Africa. Our AMOVA analyses also supported the hypothesis that patrilocality effects are evident at local and regional scales, rather than at intercontinental and global levels. Finally, our results underscore the importance of subdivision of the human paternal gene pool and imply that caution should be exercised when using models and experimental strategies based on the assumption of panmixia.

N2  - Likelihood-mapping (LM) was suggested as a method of displaying the phylogenetic content of an alignment. However, statistical properties of the method have not been studied. Here we analyze the special case of a four-species tree generated under a range of evolution models and compare the results with those of a natural extension of the likelihood-mapping approach, geometry-mapping (GM), which is based on the method of statistical geometry in sequence space. The methods are compared in their abilities to indicate the correct topology. The performance of both methods in detecting the star topology is especially explored. Our results show that LM tends to reject a star tree more often than GM. When assumptions about the evolutionary model of the maximum-likelihood reconstruction are not matched by the true process of evolution, then LM shows a tendency to favor one tree, whereas GM correctly detects the star tree except for very short outer branch lengths with a statistical significance of >0.95 for all models. LM, on the other hand, reconstructs the correct bifurcating tree with a probability of >0.95 for most branch length combinations even under models with varying substitution rates. The parameter domain for which GM recovers the true tree is much smaller. When the exterior branch lengths are larger than a (analytically derived) threshold value depending on the tree shape (rather than the evolutionary model), GM reconstructs a star tree rather than the true tree. We suggest a combined approach of LM and GM for the evaluation of starlike trees. This approach offers the possibility of testing for significant positive interior branch lengths without extensive statistical and computational efforts.

N2  - The evolutionary history of the family Bovidae remains controversial despite past comprehensive morphological and genetic investigations. In an effort to resolve some of the systematic uncertainties within the group, a combined molecular phylogeny was constructed based on four independent nuclear DNA markers (2,573 characters) and three mitochondrial DNA genes (1,690 characters) for 34 bovid taxa representing all seven of the currently recognized bovid subfamilies. The nuclear DNA fragments were analyzed separately and in combination after partition homogeneity tests were performed. There was no significant rate heterogeneity among lineages, and retention index values indicated the general absence of homoplasy in the nuclear DNA data. The conservative nuclear DNA data were remarkably effective in resolving associations among bovid subfamilies, which had a rapid radiation dating back to approximately 23 MYA. All analyses supported the monophyly of the Bovinae (cow, nilgai, and kudu clade) as a sister lineage to the remaining bovid subfamilies, and the data convincingly suggest that the subfamilies Alcelaphinae (hartebeest, tsessebe, and wildebeest group) and Hippotraginae (roan, sable, and gemsbok clade) share a close evolutionary relationship and together form a sister clade to the more primitive Caprinae (represented by sheep, goat, and muskox). The problematic Reduncinae (waterbuck, reedbuck) seem to be the earliest-diverging group of the Caprinae/Alcelaphinae/Hippotraginae clade, whereas the Antilopinae (gazelle and dwarf antelope clade) were always polyphyletic. The sequence data suggest that the initial diversification of the Bovidae took place in Eurasia and that lineages such as the Cephalophinae and other enigmatic taxa (impala, suni, and klipspringer) most likely originated, more or less contemporaneously, in Africa.

N2  - Previous analyses of retroviral nucleotide sequences, suggest a so-called "scrambled duplicative stepwise molecular evolution" (many sectors with successive duplications/deletions of short and longer motifs) that could have stemmed from one or several starter tandemly repeated short sequence(s). In the present report, we tested this hypothesis by focusing on the long terminal repeats (LTRs) (and flanking sequences) of 24 human and 3 simian immunodeficiency viruses. By using a calculation strategy applicable to short sequences, we found consensus overrepresented motifs (often containing CTG or CAG) that were congruent with the previously defined "retroviral signature." We also show many local repetition patterns that are significant when compared with simply shuffled sequences. First- and second-order Markov chain analyses demonstrate that a major portion of the overrepresented oligonucleotides can be predicted from the dinucleotide compositions of the sequences, but by no means can biological mechanisms be deduced from these results: some of the listed local repetitions remain significant against dinucleotide-conserving shuffled sequences; together with previous results, this suggests that interspersed and/or local mononucleotide and oligonucleotide repetitions could have biased the dinucleotide compositions of the sequences. We searched for suggestive evolutionary patterns by scrutinizing a reliable multiple alignment of the 27 sequences. A manually constructed alignment based on homology blocks was in good agreement with the polypeptide alignment in the coding sectors and has been exhaustively assessed by using a multiplied alphabet obtained by the promising mathematical strategy called the N-block presentation (taking into account the environment of each nucleotide in a sequence). Sector by sector, we hypothesize many successive duplication/deletion scenarios that fit our previous evolutionary hypotheses. This suggests an important duplication/deletion role for the reverse transcriptase, particularly in inducing stuttering cryptic simplicity patterns.

N2  - Previous genealogical analyses of population structure in Coccidioides immitis revealed the presence of two cryptic and sexual species in this pathogenic fungus but did not clarify their origin and relationships with respect to other taxa. By combining the C. immitis data with those of two of its closest relatives, the free-living saprophytes Auxarthron zuffianum and Uncinocarpus reesii, we show that the C. immitis species complex is monophyletic, indicating a single origin of pathogenicity. Cryptic species also were found in both A. zuffianum and U. reesii, indicating that they can be found in both pathogenic and free-living fungi. Our study, together with a few others, indicates that the current list of known fungal species might be augmented by a factor of at least two. However, at least in the C. immitis, A. zuffianum, and U. reesii complexes, cryptic species represent subdivisions at the tips of deep monophyletic clades and thus well within the existing framework of generic classification. An analysis of silent and expressed divergence and polymorphism values between and within the taxa identified by genealogical concordance did not reveal faster evolution in C. immitis as a consequence of adaptation to the pathogenic habit, nor did it show positive Darwinian evolution in a region of a dioxygenase gene (tcrP gene coding for 4-HPPD) known to cause antigenic responses in humans. Instead, the data suggested relative stasis, indicative of purifying selection against mostly deleterious mutations. Two introns in the same gene fragment were considerably more divergent than exons and were unalignable between species complexes but had very low polymorphism within taxa.

N2  - Ancient demographic events can be inferred from the distribution of pairwise sequence differences (or mismatches) among individuals. We analyzed a database of 3,677 Y chromosomes typed for 11 biallelic markers in 48 human populations from Europe and the Mediterranean area. Contrary to what is observed in the analysis of mitochondrial polymorphisms, Tajima's test was insignificant for most Y-chromosome samples, and in 47 populations the mismatch distributions had multiple peaks. Taken at face value, these results would suggest either (1) that the size of the male population stayed essentially constant over time, while the female population size increased, or (2) that different selective regimes have shaped mitochondrial and Y-chromosome diversity, leading to an excess of rare alleles only in the mitochondrial genome. An alternative explanation would be that the 11 variable sites of the Y chromosome do not provide sufficient statistical power, so a comparison with mitochondrial data (where more than 200 variable sites are studied in Europe) is impossible at present. To discriminate between these possibilities, we repeatedly analyzed a European mitochondrial database, each time considering only 11 variable sites, and we estimated mismatch distributions in stable and growing populations, generated by simulating coalescent processes. Along with theoretical considerations, these tests suggest that the difference between the mismatch distributions inferred from mitochondrial and Y-chromosome data are not a statistical artifact. Therefore, the observed mismatch distributions appear to reflect different underlying demographic histories and/or selective pressures for maternally and paternally transmitted loci.

N2  - To determine how the modern copy number (5) of hsp70 genes in Drosophila melanogaster evolved, we localized the duplication events that created the genes in the phylogeny of the melanogaster group, examined D. melanogaster genomic sequence to investigate the mechanisms of duplication, and analyzed the hsp70 gene sequences of Drosophila orena and Drosophila mauritiana. The initial two-to-four hsp70 duplication occurred 10-15 MYA, according to fixed in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes, before the origin and divergence of the melanogaster and five other species subgroups of the melanogaster group. Analysis of more than 30 kb of flanking sequence surrounding the hsp70 gene clusters suggested that this duplication was likely a retrotransposition. For the melanogaster subgroup, Southern hybridization and an hsp70 restriction map confirmed the conserved number (4) and arrangement of hsp70 genes in the seven species other than D. melanogaster. Drosophila melanogaster is unique; tandem duplication and gene conversion at the derived cluster yielded a fifth hsp70 gene. The four D. orena hsp70 genes are highly similar and concertedly evolving. In contrast, the D. mauritiana hsp70 genes are divergent, and many alleles are nonfunctional. The proliferation, concerted evolution, and maintenance of functionality in the D. melanogaster hsp70 genes is consistent with the action of natural selection in this species.

N2  - In this paper, the structure and evolution of the protein interaction network of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is analyzed. The network is viewed as a graph whose nodes correspond to proteins. Two proteins are connected by an edge if they interact. The network resembles a random graph in that it consists of many small subnets (groups of proteins that interact with each other but do not interact with any other protein) and one large connected subnet comprising more than half of all interacting proteins. The number of interactions per protein appears to follow a power law distribution. Within approximately 200 Myr after a duplication, the products of duplicate genes become almost equally likely to (1) have common protein interaction partners and (2) be part of the same subnetwork as two proteins chosen at random from within the network. This indicates that the persistence of redundant interaction partners is the exception rather than the rule. After gene duplication, the likelihood that an interaction gets lost exceeds 2.2 x 10-3/Myr. New interactions are estimated to evolve at a rate that is approximately three orders of magnitude smaller. Every 300 Myr, as many as half of all interactions may be replaced by new interactions.

N2  - We present the complete 15,455-nt mitochondrial DNA sequence of the springtail Tetrodontophora bielanensis (Arthropoda, Hexapoda, Collembola). The gene content is typical of most metazoans, with 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 2 genes encoding for ribosomal RNA subunits, and 22 tRNA genes. The nucleotide sequence shows the well-known A+T bias typical of insect mtDNA; its A+T content is lower (72.7%) than that observed in other insect species, but still higher than that in other arthropodan taxa. The bias appears to be uniform across the whole molecule, unlike other insect taxa, which show increased A+T content in the so-called A+T-rich region. However, the bias is slightly higher in the third codon positions of the PCGs (81.4%). Anomalous initiation codons have been observed in the nad2 and the cox1 genes. In the latter, the ATTTAA hexanucleotide is suggested to be involved in the initiation signaling. All tRNAs could be folded into the typical cloverleaf secondary structure, but the tRNA for cysteine appears to be missing the DHU arm. Long tandemly repeated regions (193 nt) were found in the A+T-rich region, which in turn was shown to have the possibility of forming a complex array of secondary structures. One of these structures encompassed the junction between the repeats. The A+T-rich region was also interesting in that it showed heteroplasmy in the number of repeats. Three haplotypes were found, possessing 2, 3, and 4 identical repeats, respectively. The order of protein coding and rRNA genes in the molecule was determined and was identical to that of all insects studied so far. However, two tRNA translocations were found which were unprecedented among Arthropoda. These involved the trnQ, which was found between the rrnS and the A+T-rich region, and the trnS(ucn), which was located between trnM and trnI. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the PCGs failed to find support for the monophyly of Hexapoda.

N2  - Creatine kinase (CK) is coded for by at least four loci in higher vertebrates--two cytoplasmic isoforms, muscle (M) and brain (B), and two mitochondrial isoforms, sarcomeric and ubiquitous. M is expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, while B is expressed in a variety of cells, including cardiac and smooth muscle fibers, neurons, transport epithelia, and photoreceptors. M and B subunits form very stable homodimers (MM [M-CK], BB [B-CK]) and heterodimers (MB). M-CK is capable of binding to the M line of the myofibril, thereby creating an energy transfer microcompartment; BB and MB CKs are not. M- and B-like CKs are present in all vertebrates yet examined, including fish. Cytoplasmic, dimeric CKs are widely distributed in the invertebrates. The only available amino acid sequence for an invertebrate dimeric CK, that of the protostome polychaete Chaetopterus variopedatus, is just as similar to the vertebrate M isoform as to the B isoform. Echinoderms lack dimeric, cytoplasmic CKs, which appear to be replaced by a dimeric arginine kinase which evolved secondarily from CK. Thus, it is likely that the gene duplication event producing the M and B isoforms occurred after the divergence of the chordates from echinoderms. To narrow down the timing of this duplication event, we obtained the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of dimeric CKs from the tunicate Ciona intestinalis (subphylum Urochordata) and the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae (subphylum Cephalochordata). Our results show that these CKs are strikingly similar to both invertebrate and vertebrate CKs. However, phylogenetic analyses by neighbor-joining and parsimony show that these two enzymes appeared to have diverged before the point of divergence of the M and B isoforms. Thus, the gene duplication event for formation of the muscle and brain isoforms of CK most likely occurred during the radiation of the fish, a time noted for gene duplication events at a variety of other loci.

N2  - This study examines molecular relationships across a wide range of species in the mass spawning scleractinian coral genus Acropora. Molecular phylogenies were obtained for 28 species using DNA sequence analyses of two independent markers, a nuclear intron and the mtDNA putative control region. Although the compositions of the major clades in the phylogenies based on these two markers were similar, there were several important differences. This, in combination with the fact that many species were not monophyletic, suggests either that introgressive hybridization is occurring or that lineage sorting is incomplete. The molecular tree topologies bear little similarity to the results of a recent cladistic analysis based on skeletal morphology and are at odds with the fossil record. We hypothesize that these conflicting results may be due to the same morphology having evolved independently more than once in Acropora and/or the occurrence of extensive interspecific hybridization and introgression in combination with morphology being determined by a small number of genes. Our results indicate that many Acropora species belong to a species complex or syngameon and that morphology has little predictive value with regard to syngameon composition. Morphological species in the genus often do not correspond to genetically distinct evolutionary units. Instead, species that differ in timing of gamete release tend to constitute genetically distinct clades.

N2  - We report a duplication and rearrangement of the mitochondrial genome involving the control region of parrots in the genus Amazona. This rearrangement results in a gene order of cytochrome b/tRNAThr/pND6/pGlu/CR1/tRNAPro/NADH dehydrogenase 6/tRNAGlu/CR2/tRNAPhe/12s rRNA, where CR1 and CR2 refer to duplicate control regions, and pND6 and pGlu indicate presumed pseudogenes. In contrast to previous reports of duplications involving the control regions of birds, neither copy of the parrot control region shows any indications of degeneration. Rather, both copies contain many of the conserved sequence features typically found in avian control regions, including the goose hairpin, TASs, the F, C, and D boxes, conserved sequence box 1 (CSB1), and an apparent homolog to the mammalian CSB3. We conducted a phylogenetic analysis of homologous portions of the duplicate control regions from 21 individuals representing four species of Amazona (A. ochrocephala, A. autumnalis, A. farinosa, and A. amazonica) and Pionus chalcopterus. This analysis revealed that an individual's two control region copies (i.e., the paralogous copies) were typically more closely related to one another than to corresponding segments of other individuals (i.e., the orthologous copies). The average sequence divergence of the paralogous control region copies within an individual was 1.4%, versus a mean value of 4.1% between control region orthologs representing nearest phylogenetic neighbors. No differences were found between the paralogous copies in either the rate or the pattern in which the two copies accumulated base pair changes. This pattern suggests concerted evolution of the two control regions, perhaps through occasional gene conversion events. We estimated that gene conversion events occurred on average every 34,670 ± 18,400 years based on pairwise distances between the paralogous control region sequences of each individual. Our results add to the growing body of work indicating that under some circumstances duplicated mitochondrial control regions are retained through evolutionary time rather than degenerating and being lost, presumably due to selection for a small mitochondrial genome.

N2  - Patterns of codon bias in Drosophila suggest that silent mutations can be classified into two types: unpreferred (slightly deleterious) and preferred (slightly beneficial). Results of previous analyses of polymorphism and divergence in Drosophila simulans were interpreted as supporting a mutation-selection-drift model in which slightly deleterious, silent mutants make significantly greater contributions to polymorphism than to divergence. Frequencies of unpreferred polymorphisms were inferred to be lower than frequencies of other silent polymorphisms. Here, I analyzed additional D. simulans data to reevaluate the support for these ideas. I found that D. simulans has fixed more unpreferred than preferred mutations, suggesting that this lineage has not been at mutation-selection-drift equilibrium at silent sites. Frequencies of polarized unpreferred polymorphisms are not skewed toward rare alleles. However, frequencies of unpolarized unpreferred codons are lower in high-bias genes than in low-bias genes. This supports the idea that unpreferred codons are borderline deleterious mutations. Purifying selection on silent sites appears to be stronger at twofold-degenerate codons than at fourfold-degenerate codons. Finally, I found that X-linked polymorphisms occur at a higher average frequency than polymorphisms on chromosome arm 3R, even though an average X-linked site is significantly less likely to be polymorphic than an average site on 3R. This result supports a previous analysis of D. simulans indicating different population genetics of X-linked versus autosomal mutations.

N2  - Gene flow in malaria vectors is usually estimated based on differentiation indices (e.g., FST) in order to predict the contemporary spread of genes such as those conferring resistance to insecticides. This approach is reliant on a number of assumptions, the most crucial, and the one most likely to be violated in these species, being mutation-migration-drift equilibrium. Tests of this assumption for the African malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis are the focus of this study. We analyzed variation at 18 microsatellite loci and the ND5 region of the mitochondrial genome in two populations of each species. Equilibrium was rejected by six of eight tests for the A. gambiae population from western Kenya and by three tests in eastern Kenya. In western Kenya, all departures from equilibrium were consistent with a recent population expansion, but in eastern Kenya, there were traces of a recent expansion and a bottleneck. Equilibrium was also rejected by two of the eight tests for both A. arabiensis populations; the departure from equilibrium was consistent with an expansion. These multiple-locus tests detected a genomewide effect and therefore a demographic event rather than a locus-specific effect, as would be caused by selection. Disequilibrium due to a recent expansion in these species implies that rates of gene flow, as inferred from differentiation indices, are overestimates as they include a historical component. We argue that the same effect applies to the majority of pest species due to the correlation of their demography with that of humans.

N2  - It is frequently true that molecular sequences do not evolve in a strictly clocklike manner. Instead, substitution rate may vary for a number of reasons, including changes in selection pressure and effective population size, as well as changes in mean generation time. Here we present two new methods for estimating stepwise changes in substitution rates when serially sampled molecular sequences are available. These methods are based on multiple rates with dated tips (MRDT) models and allow different rates to be estimated for different intervals of time. These intervals may correspond to the sampling intervals or to a priori-defined intervals that are not coincident with the times the serial samples are obtained. Two methods for obtaining estimates of multiple rates are described. The first is an extension of the phylogeny-based maximum-likelihood estimation procedure introduced by Rambaut. The second is a new parameterization of the pairwise distance least-squares procedure used by Drummond and Rodrigo. The utility of these methods is demonstrated on a genealogy of HIV sequences obtained at five different sampling times from a single patient over a period of 34 months.

N2  - Ciliates are a diverse group of eukaryotes characterized by their division of nuclear function into a "germ line" micronucleus and a "somatic" macronucleus. After conjugation, chromosomes in the transcriptionally active macronucleus develop by fragmentation, elimination, and amplification of germ line chromosomes. Extensive chromosomal processing that generates a macronucleus with gene-sized fragments has thus far been well documented in members of only one class of ciliates, the Spirotrichea. Here we establish the broad distribution of extensive fragmentation among members of the class Phyllopharyngea and the genera Metopus (order Armophorida) and Nyctotherus (order Clevelandellida). Moreover, analyses of small-subunit rDNA genealogies indicate that gene-sized chromosomes occur in members of the three separate clades: (1) the class Spirotrichea, (2) the class Phyllopharyngea, and (3) the two orders Clevelandellida and Armophorida. Together, these data indicate that the generation of gene-sized chromosomes is widespread and demonstrate multiple origins of extensive fragmentation within ciliates.

N2  - The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase or HMGR) fulfills an essential role in archaea, as it is required for the synthesis of isoprenoid ethers, the main component of archaeal cell membranes. There are two clearly homologous but structurally different classes of the enzyme, one found mainly in eukaryotes and archaea (class 1), and the other found in bacteria (class 2). This feature facilitated the identification of several cases of interdomain lateral gene transfer (LGT), in particular, the bacterial origin for the HMGR gene from the archaeon Archaeoglobus fulgidus. In order to investigate if this LGT event was recent and limited in its scope or had a broad and long-term impact on the recipient and its related lineages, the HMGR gene was amplified and sequenced from a variety of archaea. The survey covered close relatives of A. fulgidus, the only archaeon known prior to this study to possess a bacterial-like HMGR; representatives of each main euryarchaeal group were also inspected. All culturable members of the archaeal group Archaeoglobales were found to display an HMGR very similar to the enzyme of the bacterium Pseudomonas mevalonii. Surprisingly, two species of the genus Thermoplasma also harbor an HMGR of bacterial origin highly similar to the enzymes found in the Archaeoglobales. Phylogenetic analyses of the HMGR gene and comparisons to reference phylogenies from other genes confirm a common bacterial origin for the HMGRs of Thermoplasmatales and Archaeoglobales. The most likely explanation of these results includes an initial bacteria-to-archaea transfer, followed by a another event between archaea. Their presence in two divergent archaeal lineages suggests an important adaptive role for these laterally transferred genes.

N2  - Genomes contain not only information for current biological functions, but also information for potential novel functions that may allow the host to adapt to new environments. The field of experimental evolution studies that potential by selecting for novel functions and deducing the means by which the function evolved, but until now it has not attempted to predict the outcomes of such experiments. Here I present a model system that is being developed specifically to examine the issue of what kind of information is most useful in predicting how novel functions will evolve. The system is the evolution of a Lac-PTS transport system and a phospho-β-galactosidase hydrolase system as a novel pathway for metabolism of lactose in Escherichia coli. Two kinds of information, sequence-based phylogenetic inference and biochemical activity, are considered as predictors of which E. coli genes will evolve the required new functions. Both biochemical data and phylogenetic inference predict that the cryptic celABC genes, which currently specify a PTS-β-glucoside transport system, are most likely to evolve into a PTS-lactose transport system. Phylogenetic inference predicts that the bglA gene, which currently specifies a phospho-β-glucosidase, is most likely to evolve into a phospho-β-galactosidase. In contrast, biochemical data predict that the cryptic bglB gene, which also currently specifies a phospho-β-glucosidase, is most likely to evolve into a phospho-β-galactosidase.

N2  - Proteins are often characterized by the presence of multiple domains, which make specific contributions to their cellular function. While the gain of domains in proteins by duplication and shuffling is well established, domain loss is poorly documented. Here, we provide evidence that domain loss has played an important role in the evolution of protein architecture and function by demonstrating that fungal Zuotin proteins evolved from MIDA1-like proteins, present in animals and plants, by complete loss of the carboxyl-terminal MYB domains. Phylogenetic analyses of the DnaJ motif (the J domain) present in both Zuotin and MIDA1 proteins were complicated by the limited length and profound differences in evolutionary rates exhibited by this domain. To rigorously examine J domain phylogeny, we combined the nonparametric bootstrap with Monte Carlo simulation. This method, which we have designated the resampled parametric bootstrap, allowed us to assess type I and type II error associated with these analyses. These results revealed significant support for domain loss rather than domain gain or gene loss involving paralogs. The absence of sequences related to the MIDA1 MYB domains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae further indicates that the domains have been completely lost, consistent with known functional differences between Zuotin and MIDA1 proteins. These analyses suggest that the description of additional examples of complete domain loss may provide a method to identify orthologous proteins exhibiting functional differences using genomic sequence data.

N2  - An accurate estimate of the extent of recombination is important whenever phylogenetic methods are applied to potentially recombining nucleotide sequences. Here, data sets from viruses, bacteria, and mitochondria were examined for deviations from clonality using a new approach for detecting and measuring recombination. The apparent rate heterogeneity (ARH) among sites in a sequence alignment can be inflated as an artifact of recombination. However, the composition of polymorphic sites will differ in a data set with recombination-generated ARH versus a clonal data set that exhibits the equivalent degree of rate heterogeneity. This is because recombinant data sets, encompassing regions of conflicting phylogenetic history, tend to yield "starlike" trees that are superficially similar to those inferred from clonal data sets with weak phylogenetic signal throughout. Specifically, a recombinant data set will be unexpectedly rich in conflicting phylogenetic information compared with clonally generated data sets supporting the same tree shape. Its value of q--defined as the proportion of two-state parsimony-informative sites to all polymorphic sites--will be greater than that expected for nonrecombinant data. The method proposed here, the informative-sites test, compares the value of q against a null distribution of values found using Monte Carlo-simulated data evolved under the null hypothesis of clonality. A significant excess of q indicates that the assumption of clonality is not valid and hence that the ARH in the data is at least partly an artifact of recombination. Investigations of the procedure using simulated sequences indicated that it can successfully detect and measure recombination and that it is unlikely to produce "false positives." Simulations also showed that for recombinant data, naive use of maximum-likelihood models incorporating rate heterogeneity can lead to overestimation of the time to the most recent common ancestor. Application of the test to real data revealed for the first time that populations of viruses, like those of bacteria, can be brought close to complete linkage equilibrium by pervasive recombination. On the other hand, the test did not reject the hypothesis of clonality when applied to a data set from the coding region of human mitochondrial DNA, despite its high level of ARH and homoplasy.

N2  - With the huge increase of protein data, an important problem is to estimate, within a large protein family, the number of sensible subsets for subsequent in-depth structural, functional, and evolutionary analyses. To tackle this problem, we developed a new program, Secator, which implements the principle of an ascending hierarchical method using a distance matrix based on a multiple alignment of protein sequences. Dissimilarity values assigned to the nodes of a deduced phylogenetic tree are partitioned by a new stopping rule introduced to automatically determine the significant dissimilarity values. The quality of the clusters obtained by Secator is verified by a separate Jackknife study. The method is demonstrated on 24 large protein families covering a wide spectrum of structural and sequence conservation and its usefulness and accuracy with real biological data is illustrated on two well-studied protein families (the Sm proteins and the nuclear receptors).

N2  - The relatively recent origin of sex chromosomes in the plant genus Silene provides an opportunity to study the early stages of sex chromosome evolution and, potentially, to test between the different population genetic processes likely to operate in nonrecombining chromosomes such as Y chromosomes. We previously reported much lower nucleotide polymorphism in a Y-linked gene (SlY1) of the plant Silene latifolia than in the homologous X-linked gene (SlX1). Here, we report a more extensive study of nucleotide diversity in these sex-linked genes, including a larger S. latifolia sample and a sample from the closely related species Silene dioica, and we also study the diversity of an autosomal gene, CCLS37.1. We demonstrate that nucleotide diversity in the Y-linked genes of both S. latifolia and S. dioica is very low compared with that of the X-linked gene. However, the autosomal gene also has low DNA polymorphism, which may be due to a selective sweep. We use a single individual of the related hermaphrodite species Silene conica, as an outgroup to show that the low SlY1 diversity is not due to a lower mutation rate than that for the X-linked gene. We also investigate several other possibilities for the low SlY1 diversity, including differential gene flow between the two species for Y-linked, X-linked, and autosomal genes. The frequency spectrum of nucleotide polymorphism on the Y chromosome deviates significantly from that expected under a selective-sweep model. However, we detect population subdivision in both S. latifolia and S. dioica, so it is not simple to test for selective sweeps. We also discuss the possibility that Y-linked diversity is reduced due to highly variable male reproductive success, and we conclude that this explanation is unlikely.

N2  - A phylogenetic analysis of protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) domain evolution was performed with the inclusion of recently reported PDIs from the amitochondriate protist Giardia lamblia, yeast PDIs that contain a single thioredoxin-like domain, and PDIs from a diverse selection of protists. We additionally report and include two new giardial PDIs, each with a single thioredoxin-like domain. Inclusion of protist PDIs in our analyses revealed that the evolutionary history of the endoplasmic reticulum may not be simple. Phylogenetic analyses support common ancestry of all eukaryotic PDIs from a thioredoxin ancestor and independent duplications of thioredoxin-like domains within PDIs throughout eukaryote evolution. This was particularly evident for Acanthamoeba PDI, Dictyostelium PDI, and mammalian erp5 domains. In contrast, gene duplication, instead of domain duplication, produces PDI diversity in G. lamblia. Based on our results and the known diversity of PDIs, we present a new hypothesis that the five single-domain PDIs of G. lamblia may reflect an ancestral mechanism of protein folding in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum. The PDI complement of G. lamblia and yeast suggests that a combination of PDIs may be used as a redox chain analogous to that known for bacterial Dsb proteins.

N2  - Compositional changes are a major feature of genome evolution. Overlooking nucleotide composition differences among sequences can seriously mislead phylogenetic reconstructions. Large compositional variation exists among the members of the family Drosophilidae. Until now, however, base composition differences have been largely neglected in the formulations of the nucleotide substitution process used to reconstruct the phylogeny of this important group of species. The present study adopts a maximum-likelihood framework of phylogenetic inference in order to analyze five nuclear gene regions and shows that (1) the pattern of compositional variation in the Drosophilidae does not match the phylogeny of the species; (2) accounting for the heterogeneous GC content with Galtier and Gouy's nucleotide substitution model leads to a tree that differs in significant aspects from the tree inferred when the nucleotide composition differences are ignored, even though both phylogenetic hypotheses attain strong nodal support in the bootstrap analyses; and (3) the LogDet distance correction cannot completely overcome the distorting effects of the compositional variation that exists among the species of the Drosophilidae. Our analyses confidently place the Chymomyza genus as an outgroup closer than the genus Scaptodrosophila to the Drosophila genus and conclusively support the monophyly of the Sophophora subgenus.

N2  - We screened the genome of a trematode, Clonorchis sinensis, in order to identify novel retrotransposons and thereby provide additional information on retrotransposons for comprehensive phylogenetic study. Considering the vast potential of retrotransposons to generate genetically variable regions among individual genomes, randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) detected by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions were selected as candidates for retrotransposon-related sequences. From RAPD analysis, we isolated and characterized a novel retrotransposon in C. sinensis as the first member of uncorrupted long-terminal-repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in phylum Platyhelminthes. The retrotransposon, which was named Clonorchis sinensis Retrotransposon 1 (CsRn1), showed a genomewide distribution and had a copy number of more than 100 per haploid genome. CsRn1 encoded an uninterrupted open reading frame (ORF) of 1,304 amino acids, and the deduced ORF exhibited similarities to the pol proteins of Ty3/gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons. The mobile activity of master copies was predicted by sequence analysis and confirmed by the presence of mRNA transcripts. Phylogenetic analysis of Ty3/gypsy-like LTR retrotransposons detected a new clade comprising CsRn1, Kabuki of Bombyx mori, and an uncharacterized element of Drosophila melanogaster. With its high repetitiveness and preserved mobile activity, it is proposed that CsRn1 may play a significant role in the genomic evolution of C. sinensis.

T1  - Mitochondrial Pseudogenes Are Pervasive and Often Insidious in the Snapping Shrimp Genus Alpheus

N2  - Here we show that multiple DNA sequences, similar to the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, occur within single individuals in at least 10 species of the snapping shrimp genus Alpheus. Cloning of amplified products revealed the presence of copies that differed in length and (more frequently) in base substitutions. Although multiple copies were amplified in individual shrimp from total genomic DNA (gDNA), only one sequence was amplified from cDNA. These results are best explained by the presence of nonfunctional duplications of a portion of the mtDNA, probably located in the nuclear genome, since transfer into the nuclear gene would render the COI gene nonfunctional due to differences in the nuclear and mitochondrial genetic codes. Analysis of codon variation suggests that there have been 21 independent transfer events in the 10 species examined. Within a single animal, differences between the sequences of these pseudogenes ranged from 0.2% to 20.6%, and those between the real mtDNA and pseudogene sequences ranged from 0.2% to 18.8% (uncorrected). The large number of integration events and the large range of divergences between pseudogenes and mtDNA sequences suggest that genetic material has been repeatedly transferred from the mtDNA to the nuclear genome of snapping shrimp. Unrecognized pseudogenes in phylogenetic or population studies may result in spurious results, although previous estimates of rates of molecular evolution based on Alpheus sister taxa separated by the Isthmus of Panama appear to remain valid. Especially worrisome for researchers are those pseudogenes that are not obviously recognizable as such. An effective solution may be to amplify transcribed copies of protein-coding mitochondrial genes from cDNA rather than using genomic DNA.

N2  - The complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region was sequenced for 71 individuals from five species of the rodent genus Clethrionomys both to understand patterns of variation and to explore the existence of previously described domains and other elements. Among species, the control region ranged from 942 to 971 bp in length. Our data were compatible with the proposal of three domains (extended terminal associated sequences [ETAS], central, conserved sequence blocks [CSB]) within the control region. The most conserved region in the control region was the central domain (12% of nucleotide positions variable), whereas in the ETAS and CSB domains, 22% and 40% of nucleotide positions were variable, respectively. Tandem repeats were encountered only in the ETAS domain of Clethrionomys rufocanus. This tandem repeat found in C. rufocanus was 24 bp in length and was located at the 5' end of the control region. Only two of the proposed CSB and ETAS elements appeared to be supported by our data; however, a "CSB1-like" element was also documented in the ETAS domain.

N2  - Phylogenetic analyses of 110 serpin protein sequences revealed clades consistent with independent phylogenetic analyses based on exon-intron structure and diagnostic amino acid sites. Trees were estimated by maximum likelihood, neighbor joining, and partial split decomposition using both the BLOSUM 62 and Jones-Taylor-Thornton substitution matrices. Neighbor-joining trees gave results closest to those based on independent analyses using genomic and chromosomal data. The maximum-likelihood trees derived using the quartet puzzling algorithm were very conservative, producing many small clades that separated groups of proteins that other results suggest were related. Independent analyses based on exon-intron structure suggested that a neighbor-joining tree was more accurate than maximum-likelihood trees obtained using the quartet puzzling algorithm.

N2  - In the continuing quest for informative genes for use in molecular systematics, the protein-coding gene Elongation factor-1α (EF-1α) has rapidly become one of the most prevalent "single-copy" nuclear genes utilized, particularly in arthropods. This paper explores the molecular evolutionary dynamics and phylogenetic utility of EF-1α in the salticid spider genus Habronattus. As has been reported for other arthropod lineages, our studies indicate that multiple (two) copies of EF-1α exist in Habronattus. These copies differ in intron structure and thus in size, making it possible to easily separate PCR amplification products. We present data for an intronless EF-1α copy for three Habronattus species. The presence of nonsense mutations and generally elevated rates of amino acid change suggest that this copy is evolving under relaxed functional constraints in Habronattus. A larger taxon sample (50 species plus outgroups) is presented for an EF-1α copy that includes both intron and exon regions. Characteristics of both regions suggest that this is a functional, orthologous copy in the species sampled. Maximum-likelihood relative-rate comparisons show that exon third codon sites are evolving more than 100 times as fast as second codon sites in these sequences and that intron sites are evolving about twice as fast as exon third sites. In combination, the EF-1α data provide robust, species-level phylogenetic signal that is largely congruent with morphologically well supported areas of Habronattus phylogeny. The recovery of some novel clades, and the unexpected fragmentation of others, suggests areas requiring further phylogenetic attention.

N2  - Receptor-like protein kinases (RLKs) in plants play major roles in cellular processes and stress responses. Three soybean (Glycine max) orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana RLK were isolated and designated GmRLK1, GmRLK2, and GmRLK3. GmRLK1, GmRLK2, and GmRLK3 are similar in sequence, with GmRLK2 and GmRLK3 being nearly identical. The deduced amino acid sequences of GmRLK1, GmRLK2, and GmRLK3 possess characteristics of a transmembrane leucine-rich repeat RLK, AtCLV1. DNA fingerprinting and PCR analyses of a bacterial artificial chromosome library identified five GmRLK contigs (I-V): three for GmRLK1 (I, II, and V), one for GmRLK2 (III), and one for both GmRLK2 and GmRLK3 (IV). Phylogenetic analysis of the soybean RLKs together with other plant RLKs indicates that soybean and A. thaliana CLV1s generate a CLV1 branch, while soybean, A. thaliana, and rice RLKs generate an RLK branch. Thus, the AtCLV1 orthologs may have evolved later than the other pathogen-, environmental stress-, plant hormone-, and development-associated RLKs. A common ancestral GmRLK gene may have duplicated to give rise to GmRLK1, GmRLK2, and GmRLK3, or GmRLK2 and GmRLK3 may have resulted from a recent duplication event(s). Several amino acid replacements in the kinase domain of GmRLK1 compared with those of GmRLK2 and GmRLK3 may reflect evolutionary divergence of individual family members.

N2  - Hobo is one of the three Drosophila melanogaster transposable elements, together with the P and I elements, that seem to have recently invaded the genome of this species. Surveys of the presence of hobo in strains from different geographical and temporal origins have shown that recently collected strains contain complete and deleted elements with high sequence similarity (H strains), but old strains lack hobo elements (E strains). Besides the canonical hobo sequences, both H and E strains show other poorly known hobo-related sequences. In the present work, we analyze the presence, cytogenetic location, and structure of some of these sequences in E strains of D. melanogaster. By in situ hybridization, we found that euchromatic hobo-related sequences were in fixed positions in all six E strains analyzed: 38C in the 2L arm; 42B and 55A in the 2R arm; 79E and 80B in the 3L arm; and 82C, 84C, and 84D in the 3R arm. Sequence comparison shows that some of the hobo-related sequences from Oregon-R and iso-1 strains are similar to the canonical hobo element, but their analysis reveals that they are substantially diverged and rearranged and cannot code for a functional transposase. Our results suggest that these ubiquitous hobo-homologous sequences are immobile and are distantly related to the modern hobo elements from D. melanogaster.

N2  - Spectral tuning of visual pigments is typically accomplished through changes in opsin amino acid sequence. Within a given opsin class, changes at a few key sites control wavelength specificity. To investigate known differences in the visual pigment spectral sensitivity of the Lake Malawi cichlids, Metriaclima zebra (368, 488, and 533 nm) and Dimidiochromis compressiceps (447, 536, and 569 nm), we sequenced cone opsin genes from these species as well as Labeotropheus fuelleborni and Oreochromis niloticus. These cichlids have five distinct classes of cone opsin genes, including two unique SWS-2 genes. Comparisons of the inferred amino acid sequences from the five cone opsin genes of M. zebra, D. compressiceps, and L. fuelleborni show the sequences to be nearly identical. Therefore, evolution of key opsin sites cannot explain the differences in visual pigment sensitivities. Real-time PCR demonstrates that different cichlid species express different subsets of the available cone opsin genes. Metriaclima zebra and L. fuelleborni express a complement of genes which give them UV-shifted visual pigments, while D. compressiceps expresses a different set to produce a red-shifted visual system. Thus, variations in cichlid spectral sensitivity have arisen through evolution of gene regulation, rather than through changes in opsin amino acid sequence.

N2  - In recent years, the increased sampling of protein-coding genes from diverse eukaryotes has revealed that many aspects of each gene tree are at odds with other phylogenies. This has led to the belief that each gene tree has unique strengths and weaknesses, suggesting that an accurate picture of eukaryotic relationships will be achieved only through comparative phylogeny using several different genes. To this end, actin genes were characterized from two genera of chlorarachniophytes, Chlorarachnion and Lotharella, and three species of the cercomonad flagellate Cercomonas. Phylogenetic trees including these new actin genes confirm the recently proposed relationship between chlorarachniophytes and cercomonads (Cercozoa) and, more importantly, also show a close relationship between Cercozoa and Foraminifera. Both of these are major eukaryotic groups encompassing extremely diverse organisms, yet there is no strong evidence for the evolutionary position of either from morphological or molecular data. The union of Cercozoa and Foraminifera suggested by actin phylogeny represents a novel step in the long process of determining the broad relationships between all major eukaryotic groups.

N2  - Chloroplast genes of several dinoflagellate species are located on unigenic DNA minicircular chromosomes. We have now completely sequenced five aberrant minicircular chromosomes from the dinoflagellate Heterocapsa triquetra. These probably nonfunctional DNA circles lack complete genes, with each being composed of several short fragments of two or three different chloroplast genes and a common conserved region with a tripartite 9G-9A-9G core like the putative replicon origin of functional single-gene circular chloroplast chromosomes. Their sequences imply that all five circles evolved by differential deletions and duplications from common ancestral circles bearing fragments of four genes: psbA, psbC, 16S rRNA, and 23S rRNA. It appears that recombination between separate unigenic chromosomes initially gave intermediate heterodimers, which were subsequently stabilized by deletions that included part or all of one putative replicon origin. We suggest that homologous recombination at the 9G-9A-9G core regions produced a psbA/psbC heterodimer which generated two distinct chimeric circles by differential deletions and duplications. A 23S/16S rRNA heterodimer more likely formed by illegitimate recombination between 16S and 23S rRNA genes. Homologous recombination between the 9G-9A-9G core regions of both heterodimers and additional differential deletions and duplications could then have yielded the other three circles. Near identity of the gene fragments and 9G-9A-9G cores, despite diverging adjacent regions, may be maintained by gene conversion. The conserved organization of the 9G-9A-9G cores alone favors the idea that they are replicon origins and suggests that they may enable the aberrant minicircles to parasitize the chloroplast's replication machinery as selfish circles.

N2  - Hemocyanins are copper-containing respiratory proteins of the Arthropoda that have so far been thoroughly investigated only in the Chelicerata and the Crustacea but have remained unstudied until now in the Myriapoda. Here we report the first sequence of a myriapod hemocyanin. The hemocyanin of Spirostreptus sp. (Diplopoda: Spirostreptidae) is composed of two distinct subunits that are arranged in a 6 x 6 native molecule. The cloned hemocyanin subunit cDNA codes of for a polypeptide of 653 amino acids (75.5 kDa) that includes a signal peptide of 18 amino acids. The sequence closely resembles that of the chelicerate hemocyanins. Molecular phylogenetic analyses reject with high statistical confidence the integrity of the Tracheata (i.e., Myriapoda + Insecta) but give conflicting results on the position of the myriapod hemocyanin. While distance matrix and maximum-likelihood methods support a basal position of the Spirostreptus hemocyanin with respect to the other hemocyanins, parsimony analysis suggests a sister group relationship with the chelicerate hemocyanins. The latter topology is also supported by a unique shared deletion of an alpha-helix. A common ancestry of Myriapoda and Chelicerata should be seriously considered.

N2  - Class II fumarase sequences were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from five trichomonad species. All residues known to be highly conserved in this enzyme were present. Nuclear run-on assays showed that one of the two genes identified in Tritrichomonas foetus was expressed, whereas no fumarase transcripts were detected in the related species Trichomonas vaginalis. These findings corroborate previous biochemical data. Fumarase genes were also expressed in Monocercomonas sp. and Tetratrichomonas gallinarum but not in Pentatrichomonas hominis, Trichomonas gallinae, Trichomonas tenax, and Trichomitus batrachorum under the culture conditions used. Molecular trees inferred by likelihood methods reveal that trichomonad sequences have no affinity to described class II fumarase genes from other eukaryotes. The absence of functional mitochondria in protists such as trichomonads suggests that they diverged from other eukaryotes prior to the alpha-proteobacterial symbiosis that led to mitochondria. Furthermore, they are basal to other eukaryotes in rRNA analyses. However, support for the early-branching status of trichomonads and other amitochondriate protists based on phylogenetic analyses of multiple data sets has been equivocal. Although the presence of hydrogenosomes suggests that trichomonads once had mitochondria, their class II iron-independent fumarase sequences differ markedly from those of other mitochondriate eukaryotes. All of the class II fumarase genes described from other eukaryotes are of apparent alpha-proteobacterial origin and hence a marker of mitochondrial evolution. In contrast, the class II fumarase from trichomonads emerges among other eubacterial homologs. This is intriguing evidence for an independent acquisition of these genes in trichomonads apart from the mitochondrial endosymbiosis event that gave rise to the form present in other eukaryotes. The ancestral trichomonad class II fumarase may represent a prokaryotic form that was replaced in other eukaryotes after the divergence of trichomonads with the movement of endosymbiont genes into the nucleus. Alternatively, it may have been acquired via a separate endosymbiotic event or lateral gene transfer.

N2  - The selective pressure at the protein level is usually measured by the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω = dN/dS), with ω < 1, ω = 1, and ω > 1 indicating purifying (or negative) selection, neutral evolution, and diversifying (or positive) selection, respectively. The ω ratio is commonly calculated as an average over sites. As every functional protein has some amino acid sites under selective constraints, averaging rates across sites leads to low power to detect positive selection. Recently developed models of codon substitution allow the ω ratio to vary among sites and appear to be powerful in detecting positive selection in empirical data analysis. In this study, we used computer simulation to investigate the accuracy and power of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) in detecting positive selection at amino acid sites. The test compares two nested models: one that allows for sites under positive selection (with ω > 1), and another that does not, with the χ2 distribution used for significance testing. We found that use of the χ2 distribution makes the test conservative, especially when the data contain very short and highly similar sequences. Nevertheless, the LRT is powerful. Although the power can be low with only 5 or 6 sequences in the data, it was nearly 100% in data sets of 17 sequences. Sequence length, sequence divergence, and the strength of positive selection also were found to affect the power of the LRT. The exact distribution assumed for the ω ratio over sites was found not to affect the effectiveness of the LRT.

N2  - Eukaryotic phenotypic diversity arises from multitasking of a core proteome of limited size. Multitasking is routine in computers, as well as in other sophisticated information systems, and requires multiple inputs and outputs to control and integrate network activity. Higher eukaryotes have a mosaic gene structure with a dual output, mRNA (protein-coding) sequences and introns, which are released from the pre-mRNA by posttranscriptional processing. Introns have been enormously successful as a class of sequences and comprise up to 95% of the primary transcripts of protein-coding genes in mammals. In addition, many other transcripts (perhaps more than half) do not encode proteins at all, but appear both to be developmentally regulated and to have genetic function. We suggest that these RNAs (eRNAs) have evolved to function as endogenous network control molecules which enable direct gene-gene communication and multitasking of eukaryotic genomes. Analysis of a range of complex genetic phenomena in which RNA is involved or implicated, including co-suppression, transgene silencing, RNA interference, imprinting, methylation, and transvection, suggests that a higher-order regulatory system based on RNA signals operates in the higher eukaryotes and involves chromatin remodeling as well as other RNA-DNA, RNA-RNA, and RNA-protein interactions. The evolution of densely connected gene networks would be expected to result in a relatively stable core proteome due to the multiple reuse of components, implying that cellular differentiation and phenotypic variation in the higher eukaryotes results primarily from variation in the control architecture. Thus, network integration and multitasking using trans-acting RNA molecules produced in parallel with protein-coding sequences may underpin both the evolution of developmentally sophisticated multicellular organisms and the rapid expansion of phenotypic complexity into uncontested environments such as those initiated in the Cambrian radiation and those seen after major extinction events.

N2  - A large number of group I introns were discovered in coding regions of small and large subunits of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (SSU rDNA and LSU rDNA) in ascomycetous fungi of the genus Cordyceps. From 28 representatives of the genus, we identified in total 69 group I introns which were inserted at any of four specific sites in SSU rDNA and four specific sites in LSU rDNA. These group I introns reached sizes of up to 510 bp, occurred in up to eight sites in the same organism, and belonged to either subgroup IB3 or subgroup IC1 based on their sequence and structure. Introns inserted at the same site were closely related to each other among Cordyceps fungi, whereas introns inserted at different sites were phylogenetically distinct even in the same species. Mapped on the host phylogeny, the group I introns were generally not restricted to a particular lineage, but, rather, widely and sporadically distributed among distinct lineages. When the phylogenetic relationships of introns inserted at the same site were compared with the phylogeny of their hosts, the topologies were generally significantly congruent to each other. From these results, the evolutionary dynamics of multiple group I introns in Cordyceps fungi was inferred as follows: (1) most of the group I introns were already present at the eight sites in SSU and LSU rDNAs of the ancestor of the genus Cordyceps; (2) the introns have principally been immobile and vertically transmitted throughout speciation and diversification of Cordyceps fungi, which resulted in the phylogenetic congruence between the introns at the same site and their hosts; (3) in the course of vertical transmission, the introns have repeatedly been lost in a number of lineages independently, which has led to the present sporadic phylogenetic distribution of the introns; and (4) a few acquisitions of new introns, presumably through horizontal transmission, were identified in the evolutionary history of the genus Cordyceps, while no transpositions were detected. Losses of group I introns in SSU rDNA have occurred at least 27 times in the evolutionary course of the 28 Cordyceps members.

N2  - The Aldolase multigene family comprises three functional genes (A, B, and C) with tissue-specific expression regulated during ontogeny. DGGE analysis and nucleotide sequencing reveal a family of retropseudogenes of type A in species of Mus. Significant variation in rates of evolution of Aldolase A retropseudogenes is apparent. Our analyses demonstrate that (1) multiple events of retrotransposition are needed to account for the diversity of Aldolase A processed pseudogenes found in mice; (2) some of these sequences have undergone further duplication subsequent to the original retrotransposition event; (3) the patterns of nucleotide substitution are broadly comparable with previous estimates; and (4) estimates of rates of divergence for this array of sequences are up to four times higher than those reported in the literature.

N2  - Our previous study of the North American biogeography of Bangia revealed the presence of two introns inserted at positions 516 and 1506 in the nuclear-encoded SSU rRNA gene. We subsequently sequenced nuclear SSU rRNA in additional representatives of this genus and the sister genus Porphyra in order to examine the distribution, phylogeny, and structural characteristics of these group I introns. The lengths of these introns varied considerably, ranging from 467 to 997 nt for intron 516 and from 509 to 1,082 nt for intron 1506. The larger introns contained large insertions in the P2 domain of intron 516 and the P1 domain of intron 1506 that correspond to open reading frames (ORFs) with His-Cys box homing endonuclease motifs. These ORFs were found on the complementary strand of the 1506 intron in Porphyra fucicola and P. umbilicalis (HG), unlike the 516 intron in P. abbottae, P. kanakaensis, P. tenera (SK), Bangia fuscopurpurea (Helgoland), and B. fuscopurpurea (MA). Frameshifts were noted in the ORFs of the 516 introns in P. kanakaensis and B. fuscopurpurea (HL), and all ORFs terminated prematurely relative to the amino acid sequence for the homing endonuclease I-Ppo I. This raises the possibility that these sequences are pseudogenes. Phylogenies generated using sequences of both introns and the 18S rRNA gene were congruent, which indicated long-term immobility and vertical inheritance of the introns followed by subsequent loss in more derived lineages. The introns within the florideophyte species Hildenbrandia rubra (position 1506) were included to determine relationships with those in the Bangiales. The two sequences of intron 1506 analyzed in Hildenbrandia were positioned on a well-supported branch associated with members of the Bangiales, indicating possible common ancestry. Structural analysis of the intron sequences revealed a signature structural feature in the P5b domain of intron 516 that is unique to all Bangialean introns in this position and not seen in intron 1506 or other group IC1 introns.

N2  - Using a degenerate PCR approach, we performed an exhaustive search of Otx genes in the reedfish Erpetoichthys calabaricus, the dogfish Scyliorhinus canicula, and the hagfish Myxine glutinosa. Three novel Otx genes were identified in each of these species, and their deduced protein sequences were determined over a large C-terminal fragment located immediately downstream of the homeodomain. Like their lamprey and osteichthyan counterparts, these nine genes display a tandem duplication of a 20-25-residue C-terminal domain, which appears to be a hallmark of all craniate Otx genes identified thus far, including the highly divergent Crx gene. Phylogenetic analyses show that, together with their osteichthyan counterparts, the dogfish and reedfish genes can be classified into three gnathostome orthology classes. Two of the three genes identified in each of these species belong to the Otx1 and Otx2 orthology classes previously characterized in osteichthyans. The third one unambiguously clusters with the Otx5/Otx5b genes recently characterized in Xenopus laevis, thus defining a novel orthology class. Our results also strongly suggest that the highly divergent Crx genes identified in humans, rodents, and oxen are the mammalian representatives of this third class. The hagfish genes display no clear relationships to the three gnathostome orthology classes, but one of them appears to be closely related to the LjOtxA gene, previously identified in Lampetra japonica. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the Otx multigene families characterized in craniates all derive from duplications of a single ancestral gene which occurred after the splitting of cephalochordates but prior to the gnathostome radiation. Using site-by-site sequence comparisons of the gnathostome Otx proteins, we also identified structural constraints selectively acting on each of the three gnathostome orthology classes. This suggests that specialized functions for each of these orthology classes were fixed in the gnathostome lineage prior to the splitting between osteichthyans and chondrichthyans.

N2  - Crossbreeding with free-ranging domestic cats is supposed to threaten the genetic integrity of wildcat populations in Europe, although the diagnostic markers to identify "pure" or "admixed" wildcats have never been clearly defined. Here we use mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences and allelic variation at 12 microsatellite loci to genotype 128 wild and domestic cats sampled in Italy which were preclassified into three separate groups: European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris), Sardinian wildcats (Felis silvestris libyca), and domestic cats (Felis silvestris catus), according to their coat color patterns, collection localities, and other phenotypical traits, independently of any genetic information. For comparison, we included some captive-reared hybrids of European wild and domestic cats. Genetic variability was significantly partitioned among the three groups (mtDNA estimate of FST = 0.36; microsatellite estimate of RST = 0.30; P < 0.001), suggesting that morphological diversity reflects the existence of distinct gene pools. Multivariate ordination of individual genotypes and clustering of interindividual genetic distances also showed evidence of distinct cat groups, partially congruent with the morphological classification. Cluster analysis, however, did not enable hybrid cats to be identified from genetic information alone, nor were all individuals assigned to their populations. In contrast, a Bayesian admixture analysis simultaneously assigned the European wildcats, the Sardinian wildcats, and the domestic cats to different clusters, independent of any prior information, and pointed out the admixed gene composition of the hybrids, which were assigned to more than one cluster. Only one putative Sardinian wildcat was assigned to the domestic cat cluster, and one presumed European wildcat showed mixed (hybrid) ancestry in the domestic cat gene pool. Mitochondrial DNA sequences indicated that three additional presumed European wildcats might have hybrid ancestry. These four cats were sampled from the same area in the northernmost edge of the European wildcat distribution in the Italian Apennines. Admixture analyses suggest that wild and domestic cats in Italy are distinct, reproductively isolated gene pools and that introgression of domestic alleles into the wild-living population is very limited and geographically localized.

N2  - Several technical, social, and biological networks were recently found to demonstrate scale-free and small-world behavior instead of random graph characteristics. In this work, the topology of protein domain networks generated with data from the ProDom, Pfam, and Prosite domain databases was studied. It was found that these networks exhibited small-world and scale-free topologies with a high degree of local clustering accompanied by a few long-distance connections. Moreover, these observations apply not only to the complete databases, but also to the domain distributions in proteomes of different organisms. The extent of connectivity among domains reflects the evolutionary complexity of the organisms considered.

N2  - A correspondence analysis of codon usage in Xenopus laevis revealed that the first axis is strongly correlated with the base composition at third codon positions. The second axis discriminates between putatively highly expressed genes and the other coding sequences, with expression levels being confirmed by the analysis of Expressed sequence tag frequencies. The comparison of codon usage of the sequences displaying the extreme values on the second axis indicates that several codons are statistically more frequent among the highly expressed (mainly housekeeping) genes. Translational selection appears, therefore, to influence synonymous codon usage in Xenopus.

N2  - We investigated the relationship between satellite copy number and chromosomal evolution in tuco-tucos (genus Ctenomys), a karyotypically diverse clade of rodents. To explore phylogenetic relationships among 23 species and 5 undescribed forms, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial cytochrome b genes of 27 specimens and incorporated 27 previously published sequences. We then used quantitative dot-blot techniques to assess changes in the copy number of the major Ctenomys satellite DNA (satDNA), named RPCS. Our analysis of the relationship between variation in copy number of RPCS and chromosomal changes employed a maximum-likelihood approach to infer the copy number of the satellite RPCS in the ancestors of each clade. We found that amplifications and deletions of RPCS were associated with extensive chromosomal rearrangements even among closely related species. In contrast, RPCS copy number stability was observed within clades characterized by chromosomal stability. This example reinforces the suspected role of amplification, deletion, and intragenomic movement of satDNA in promoting extensive chromosomal evolution.

N2  - The cytosolic isoform of plant acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a multidomain enzyme involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids and in secondary metabolism. Chromosome mapping of wheat identified one locus containing cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes (Acc-2) and a related partially processed pseudogene (Ψ-Acc-2) in the distal region of the long arm of wheat homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. Multiple copies of the Acc-2 genes, whose presence was suggested by sequence analysis, are likely to be arranged in tandem repeats. At least three out of five genes cloned from hexaploid wheat map to this locus. Another locus containing Acc-2-related sequences is present in the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 5D. The identity of the hybridizing DNA present at this locus remains unknown. A system based on PCR-cloning and DNA sequence analysis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes was developed to address various phylogenetic and systematics questions in grasses. It was applied to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Acc-2 genes from D- and S-genome Aegilops and A-genome Triticum diploid species, AABB- and AAGG-genome tetraploid wheat, and AABBDD-genome hexaploid wheat, as well as from rye and barley. The combined cytogenetic and molecular evolution approach allowed assignment of gene sequences included in phylogenetic analysis to specific loci on homoeologous chromosomes. Recurring gene duplication followed by chromosome translocation and/or possible loss of some gene copies, as well as loss of introns, occurred in the gene family in different plant lineages. Two major Acc-2 clades appeared before the divergence of barley and rye. Nucleotide substitution rates in different parts of the Acc-2 gene were assessed. This analysis of the Acc-2 loci provides detailed information regarding evolutionary events at a low-copy-number locus containing important functional genes. These events are likely to be common and to play a significant role in shaping grass genomes.

N2  - We sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of the articulate brachiopod Terebratalia transversa. The circular genome is 14,291 bp in size, relatively small compared with other published metazoan mtDNAs. The 37 genes commonly found in animal mtDNA are present; the size decrease is due to the truncation of several tRNA, rRNA, and protein genes, to some nucleotide overlaps, and to a paucity of noncoding nucleotides. Although the gene arrangement differs radically from those reported for other metazoans, some gene junctions are shared with two other articulate brachiopods, Laqueus rubellus and Terebratulina retusa. All genes in the T. transversa mtDNA, unlike those in most metazoan mtDNAs reported, are encoded by the same strand. The A+T content (59.1%) is low for a metazoan mtDNA, and there is a high propensity for homopolymer runs and a strong base-compositional strand bias. The coding strand is quite G+T-rich, a skew that is shared by the confamilial (laqueid) species L. rubellus but is the opposite of that found in T. retusa, a cancellothyridid. These compositional skews are strongly reflected in the codon usage patterns and the amino acid compositions of the mitochondrial proteins, with markedly different usages being observed between T. retusa and the two laqueids. This observation, plus the similarity of the laqueid noncoding regions to the reverse complement of the noncoding region of the cancellothyridid, suggests that an inversion that resulted in a reversal in the direction of first-strand replication has occurred in one of the two lineages. In addition to the presence of one noncoding region in T. transversa that is comparable with those in the other brachiopod mtDNAs, there are two others with the potential to form secondary structures; one or both of these may be involved in the process of transcript cleavage.

N2  - Five groups of basal angiosperms, Amborella, Nymphaeales, Illiciales, Trimeniaceae, and Austrobaileya (ANITA), were identified in several recent studies as representing a series of the earliest-diverging lineages of the angiosperm phylogeny. All of these studies except one employed a multigene analysis approach and used gymnosperms as the outgroup to determine the ingroup topology. The high level of divergence between gymnosperms and angiosperms, however, has long been implicated in the difficulty of reconstructing relationships at the base of angiosperm phylogeny using DNA sequences, for fear of long-branch attraction (LBA). In this study, we replaced the gymnosperm sequences from the five-gene matrix (mitochondrial atp1 and matR, plastid atpB and rbcL, and nuclear 18S rDNA) used in our earlier study with four categories of divergent sequences--random sequences with equal base frequencies or equally AT- and GC-rich contents, homopolymers and heteropolymers, misaligned gymnosperm sequences, and aligned lycopod and bryophyte sequences--to evaluate whether the gymnosperms were an appropriate outgroup to angiosperms in our earlier study that identified the ANITA rooting. All 24 analyses performed rooted the angiosperm phylogeny at either Acorus or Alisma (or Alisma-Triglochin-Potamogeton in one case due to use of a slightly different alignment) and placed the monocots as a basal grade, producing genuine LBA results. These analyses demonstrate that the identification of ANITA as the basalmost extant angiosperms was based on historical signals preserved in the gymnosperm sequences and that the gymnosperms were an appropriate outgroup with which to root the angiosperm phylogeny in the multigene sequence analysis. This strategy of evaluating the appropriateness of an outgroup using artificial sequences and a series of outgroups with increments of divergence levels can be applied to investigations of phylogenetic patterns at the bases of other major clades, such as land plants, animals, and eukaryotes.

N2  - GLABROUS1 (GL1) belongs to the large family of MYB transcription factors and is known to play a central role in trichome initiation. We studied trichome distribution and the molecular variation of GL1 in 28 A. thaliana accessions. Trichome density on rosette leaves was highly variable among those accessions. On the molecular level, we detected substantial sequence variation in a 3-kb fragment which included the complete coding region of the GL1 locus (π = 0.01). Phylogenetic analysis of GL1 indicates the presence of two diverged clades among 28 accessions. Using ANOVA, we show that the phenotypic variation in trichome density cannot be explained by the sequence divergence between the two phylogenetic lineages. Sequence analysis of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata accessions indicates that all amino acid substitutions are located outside of the conserved helix-turn-helix DNA-binding domains R2 and R3. Using plants of A. thaliana and A. lyrata with either naturally occurring or ethyl methane sulfonate-induced glabrous phenotypes, we demonstrate that the last 14 C-terminal amino acids of the GL1 gene have no major impact on the initiation of trichomes.

N2  - Although the evolution of protein-coding sequences within genomes is well understood, the same cannot be said of the cis-regulatory regions that control transcription. Yet, changes in gene expression are likely to constitute an important component of phenotypic evolution. We simulated the evolution of new transcription factor binding sites via local point mutations. The results indicate that new binding sites appear and become fixed within populations on microevolutionary timescales under an assumption of neutral evolution. Even combinations of two new binding sites evolve very quickly. We predict that local point mutations continually generate considerable genetic variation that is capable of altering gene expression.

N2  - Over the past decade, nearly 1,000 variants have been identified in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene in classic and atypical cystic fibrosis (CF) patients worldwide, and an enormous wealth of information concerning the structure and function of the protein has also been accumulated. These data, if evaluated together in a sequence comparison of all currently available CFTR homologs, are likely to refine the global structure-function relationship of the protein, which will, in turn, facilitate interpretation of the identified mutations in the gene. Based on such a combined analysis, we had recently defined a "functional R domain" of the CFTR protein. First, presenting two full-length cDNA sequences (termed sCFTR-I and sCFTR-II) from the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and an additional partial coding sequence from the eastern gray kangaroo (Macropus giganteus), this study went further to refine the boundaries of the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) and the COOH-terminal tail (C-tail), wherein NBD1 was defined as going from P439 to G646, NBD2 as going from A1225 to E1417, and the C-tail as going from E1418 to L1480. This approach also provided further insights into the differential roles of the two halves of CFTR and highlighted several well-conserved motifs that may be involved in inter- or intramolecular interactions. Moreover, a serious concern that a certain fraction of missense mutations identified in the CFTR gene may not have functional consequences was raised. Finally, phylogenetic analysis of all the full-length CFTR amino acid sequences and an extended set of exon 13-coding nucleotide sequences reinforced the idea that the rabbit may represent a better CF model than the mouse and strengthened the assertion that a long-branch attraction artifact separates the murine rodents from the rabbit and the guinea pig, the other Glires.

N2  - We tried to identify the substitutions involved in the establishment of replication strand bias, which has been recognized as an important evolutionary factor in the evolution of bacterial genomes. First, we analyzed the composition asymmetry of 28 complete bacterial genomes and used it to test the possibility that asymmetric deamination of cytosine might be at the origin of the bias. The model showed significant correlation to the data but left unexplained a significant portion of the variance and indicated a systematic underestimation of GC skews in comparison with TA skews. Second, we analyzed the substitutions acting on the genes from five fully sequenced Chlamydia genomes that had not suffered strand switch since speciation. This analysis showed that substitutions were not at equilibrium in Chlamydia trachomatis or in C. muridarum and that strand bias is still an on-going process in these genes. Third, we identified substitutions involved in the adaptation of genes that had switched strands after speciation. These genes adapted quickly to the skewed composition of the new strand, mostly due to C→T, A→G, and C→G asymmetric substitutions. This observation was reinforced by the analysis of genes that switched strands after divergence between Bacillus subtilis and B. halodurans. Finally, we propose a more extended model based on the analysis of the substitution asymmetries of Chlamydia. This model fits well with the data provided by bacterial genomes presenting strong strand bias.

N2  - Evolutionary success requires that animal venoms are targeted against phylogenetically conserved molecular structures of fundamental physiological processes. Species producing venoms must be resistant to their action. Venoms of Elapidae snakes (e.g., cobras, kraits) contain α-neurotoxins, represented by α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) targeted against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) of the neuromuscular junction. The model which presumes that cobras (Naja spp., Elapidae) have lost their binding site for conspecific α-neurotoxins because of the unique amino acid substitutions in their nAChR polypeptide backbone per se is incompatible with the evolutionary theory that (1) the molecular motifs forming the α-neurotoxin target site on the nAChR are fundamental for receptor structure and/or function, and (2) the α-neurotoxin target site is conserved among Chordata lineages. To test the hypothesis that the α-neurotoxin binding site is conserved in Elapidae snakes and to identify the mechanism of resistance against conspecific α-neurotoxins, we cloned the ligand binding domain of the Egyptian cobra (Naja haje) nAChR α subunit. When expressed as part of a functional Naja/mouse chimeric nAChR in Xenopus oocytes, this domain confers resistance against α-BTX but does not alter responses induced by the natural ligand acetylcholine. Further mutational analysis of the Naja/mouse nAChR demonstrated that an N-glycosylation signal in the ligand binding domain that is unique to N. haje is responsible for α-BTX resistance. However, when the N-glycosylation signal is eliminated, the nAChR containing the N. haje sequence is inhibited by α-BTX with a potency that is comparable to that in mammals. We conclude that the binding site for conspecific α-neurotoxin in Elapidae snakes is conserved in the nAChR ligand binding domain polypeptide backbone per se. This conclusion supports the hypothesis that animal toxins are targeted against evolutionarily conserved molecular motifs. Such conservation also calls for a revision of the present model of the α-BTX binding site. The approach described here can be used to identify the mechanism of resistance against conspecific venoms in other species and to characterize toxin-receptor coevolution.

N2  - Polytoma obtusum and Polytoma uvella are members of a clade of nonphotosynthetic chlorophyte algae closely related to Chlamydomonas humicola and other photosynthetic members of the Chlamydomonadaceae. Descended from a nonphotosynthetic mutant, these obligate heterotrophs retain a plastid (leucoplast) with a functional protein synthetic system, and a plastid genome (lpDNA) with functional genes encoding proteins required for transcription and translation. Comparative studies of the evolution of genes in chloroplasts and leucoplasts can identify modes of selection acting on the plastid genome. Two plastid genes--rrn16, encoding the plastid small-subunit rRNA, and tufA, encoding elongation factor Tu--retain their functions in protein synthesis after the loss of photosynthesis in two nonphotosynthetic Polytoma clades but show a substantially accelerated rate of base substitution in the P. uvella clade. The accelerated evolution of tufA is due, at least partly, to relaxed codon bias favoring codons that can be read without wobble, mainly in three amino acids. Selection for these codons may be relaxed because leucoplasts are required to synthesize fewer protein molecules per unit time than are chloroplasts (reduced protein synthetic load) and thus require a lower rate of synthesis of elongation factor Tu. Relaxed selection due to a lower protein synthetic load is also a plausible explanation for the accelerated rate of evolution of rrn16, but the available data are insufficient to test the hypothesis for this gene. The tufA and rrn16 genes in Polytoma oviforme, the sole member of a second nonphotosynthetic clade, are also functional but show no sign of relaxed selection.

N2  - The cytochrome P450 2C (CYP2C) gene locus was found to include a novel exon 1 sequence with high similarity to the canonical exon 1 of CYP2C18. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and PCR amplifications of human liver cDNA revealed the presence of several intergenic species containing the CYP2C18 exon 1-like sequence spliced to different combinations of exonic and intronic sequences from the CYP2C9 gene. One splice variant was found to have an open reading frame starting at the canonical translation initiation codon of the CYP2C18 exon 1-like sequence. Another variant consisted of the nine typical CYP2C9 exons spliced after the CYP2C18 exon 1-like sequence through a segment of CYP2C9 5' flanking sequences. Moreover, analysis of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones revealed that the CYP2C18 exon 1-like sequence was located in the intergenic region between the CYP2C19 and CYP2C9 genes. The finding that a solitary exon is spliced with sequences from a neighboring gene may be interpreted as representing a general evolutionary mechanism aimed at using the full expression potential of a cell's genomic informational content.

N2  - This study examined the evolutionary dynamics of Bov-B LINEs in vertebrates and the evolution of the RTE clade of non-LTR retrotransposons. The first full-length reptilian Bov-B LINE element is described; it is 3.2 kb in length, with a structural organization typical of the RTE clade of non-LTR retrotransposons. The long-term evolution of Bov-B LINEs was studied in 10 species of Squamata by analysis of a PCR-amplified 1.8-kb fragment encoding part of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease, the intervening domain, and the palm/fingers subdomain of reverse transcriptase. A very high level of conservation in Squamata Bov-B long interspersed nuclear elements has been found, reaching 86% identity in the nearly 600 amino acids of ORF2. The same level of conservation exists between the ancestral snake lineage and Ruminantia. Such a high level is exceptional when compared with the level of conservation observed in nuclear and mitochondrial proteins and in other transposable elements. The RTE clade has been found to be much more widely distributed than previously thought, and novel representatives have been discovered in plants, brown algae, annelids, crustaceans, mollusks, echinoderms, and teleost fishes. Evolutionary relationships in the RTE clade were deduced at the amino acid level from three separate regions of ORF2. By using different independent methods, including the divergence-versus-age analysis, several examples of horizontal transfer in the RTE clade were recognized, with important implications for the existence of HT in non-LTR retrotransposons.

N2  - In the past decade, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 826 representative East Asians and Papuans has been typed by high-resolution (14-enzyme) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Compared with mtDNA control region sequencing, RFLP typing of the complete human mitochondrial DNA generally yields a cleaner phylogeny, the nodes of which can be dated assuming a molecular clock. We present here a novel star contraction algorithm which rigorously identifies starlike nodes (clusters) diagnostic of prehistoric demographic expansions. Applied to the Asian and Papuan data, we date the out-of-Africa migration of the ancestral mtDNA types that founded all Eurasian (including Papuan) lineages at 54,000 years. While the proto-Papuan mtDNA continued expanding at this time along a southern route to Papua New Guinea, the proto-Eurasian mtDNA appears to have drifted genetically and does not show any comparable demographic expansion until 30,000 years ago. By this time, the East Asian, Indian, and European mtDNA pools seem to have separated from each other, as postulated by the weak Garden of Eden model. The east Asian expansion entered America about 25,000 years ago, but was then restricted on both sides of the Pacific to more southerly latitudes during the Last Glacial Maximum around 20,000 years ago, coinciding with a chronological gap in our expansion dates. Repopulation of northern Asian latitudes occurred after the Last Glacial Maximum, obscuring the ancestral Asian gene pool of Amerinds.

N2  - DNA sequence variations of chalcone synthase (Chs) and Apetala3 gene promoters from 22 cruciferous plant species were analyzed to identify putative conserved regulatory elements. Our comparative approach confirmed the existence of numerous conserved sequences which may act as regulatory elements in both investigated promoters. To confirm the correct identification of a well-conserved UV-light-responsive promoter region, a subset of Chs promoter fragments were tested in Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. All promoters displayed similar light responsivenesses, indicating the general functional relevance of the conserved regulatory element. In addition to known regulatory elements, other highly conserved regions were detected which are likely to be of functional importance. Phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences from both promoters (gene trees) were compared with the hypothesized phylogenetic relationships (species trees) of these taxa. The data derived from both promoter sequences were congruent with the phylogenies obtained from coding regions of other nuclear genes and from chloroplast DNA sequences. This indicates that promoter sequence evolution generally is reflective of species phylogeny. Our study also demonstrates the great value of comparative genomics and phylogenetics as a basis for functional analysis of promoter action and gene regulation.

N2  - The complete sequence of the mitochondrial (mt) genome of Buteo buteo was determined. Its gene content and nucleotide composition are typical for avian genomes. Due to expanded noncoding sequences, Buteo possesses the longest mt genome sequenced so far (18,674 bp). The gene order comprising the control region and neighboring genes is identical to that of Falco peregrinus, suggesting that the corresponding rearrangement occurred before the falconid/accipitrid split. Phylogenetic analyses performed with the mt sequence of Buteo and nine other mt genomes suggest that for investigations at higher taxonomic levels (e.g., avian orders), concatenated rRNA and tRNA gene sequences are more informative than protein gene sequences with respect to resolution and bootstrap support. Phylogenetic analyses indicate an early split between Accipitridae and Falconidae, which, according to molecular dating of other avian divergence times, can be assumed to have taken place in the late Cretaceous 65-83 MYA.

N2  - Pax genes encode nuclear transcription factors that are involved in developmental control. They contain a conserved DNA-binding domain, the paired domain. The DNA-binding specificity of paired domains is directly related to the gene regulation function of Pax proteins. Pax genes were previously divided into five groups on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of paired domains. In this study, two highly similar cnidarian Pax-B genes from Cladonema californicum, a jellyfish with eyes, were found and sequenced. In an effort to understand the function of the cnidarian Pax genes isolated in this and a previous study, we characterized the consensus DNA sequences bound by the cnidarian paired domains using a PCR-based method and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The consensus DNA sequences obtained are very similar to those bound by mammalian Pax proteins. Comparison of known consensus sequences indicates that they are all partially palindromic, but this characteristic is most prominent in cnidarians, which suggests that the DNA sequences bound by the ancestral paired domain could have been palindromic. Also, cnidarian paired domains, like those of Pax-2/5/8, possess a broader binding specificity than other paired domains, which implies that the common ancestor of Pax-2/5/8 and Pax-4/6 paired domains could also have had a similar broad DNA-binding specificity. Thus far, a definitive Pax-6 gene has not been found in several cnidarian species examined, which is consistent with a later origin of the Pax-6 gene and raises two possibilities: the Pax genes of cnidarians are multifunctional and control two or more developmental pathways, including eye development, or they use a Pax-independent pathway for eye development. Whether this pathway does exist and is unique to cnidarians or it whether it represents a true master control under which Pax-6 was later included remains to be determined.

N2  - Pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent cysteine desulfurase (IscS) is an essential enzyme in the assembly of FeS clusters in bacteria as well as in the mitochondria of eukaryotes. Although FeS proteins are particularly important for the energy metabolism of amitochondrial anaerobic eukaryotes, there is no information about FeS cluster formation in these organisms. We identified and sequenced two IscS homologs of Trichomonas vaginalis (TviscS-1 and TviscS-2) and one of Giardia intestinalis (GiiscS). TviscS-1, TviscS-2, and GiiscS possess the typical conserved regions implicated in cysteine desulfurase activity. N-termini of TviscS-1 and TviscS-2 possess eight amino acid extensions, which resemble the N-terminal presequences that target proteins to hydrogenosomes in trichomonads. No presequence was evident in GiiscS from Giardia, an organism that apparently lacks hydrogenosmes or mitochondria. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship among all eukaryotic IscS genes including those of amitochondriates. IscS of proteobacteria formed a sister group to the eukaryotic clade, suggesting that isc-related genes were present in the proteobacterial endosymbiotic ancestor of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. NifS genes of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, which are IscS homologs required for specific formation of FeS clusters in nitrogenase, formed a more distant group. The phylogeny indicates the presence of a common mechanism for FeS cluster formation in mitochondriates as well as in amitochondriate eukaryotes. Furthermore, the analyses support a common origin of Trichomonas hydrogenosomes and mitochondria, as well as secondary loss of mitochondrion/hydrogenosome-like organelles in Giardia.

N2  - There exist many methods to detect recombination or mosaic structure in a sample of DNA sequences. But how reliable are they? Four methods were investigated with respect to their power to detect recombination in simulated samples with different amounts of recombination and mutation. In addition, we investigated the impact of the shape of the underlying genealogy on their performances. We found that the methods detected far fewer recombinations than were theoretically possible and that methods based on the principle of incompatibility in general had more power than methods that did not make use of this principle explicitly. This seemed, in particular, to be the case for phylogenies generated under population expansion scenarios which result in long branches at the tips and small deep branches. In addition to the results obtained through simulations, a series of new theoretical results on recombination is presented.

N2  - Low levels of genetic diversity and divergence at nuclear loci have previously been observed for cycloidea and fil1-like genes within and between several Antirrhinum species, and divergence at these loci is also low between species in genera at different levels of relatedness in the former family Scrophulariaceae (Digitalis and Verbascum). The low divergence values are surprising, because (based on the sequences of chloroplast loci) the Scrophulariaceae are thought to be polyphyletic, with two anciently diverged clades, and the species we compared belonged to the two different clades. Here, we extend our studies of sequence divergence to more nuclear genes: fil2, far, globosa, and Adh. Detailed studies revealed that in Antirrhinum these genes belong to gene families. Low levels of divergence between Antirrhinum and Verbascum were observed for four of the loci studied, fil2-1, fil2-2, far-L, and globosa, similar to our previous observations. We discuss hypotheses to explain these low synonymous divergence values. For Adh, no cases of very similar sequences were found, but, rather, our sequences from the three different genera (Antirrhinum, Digitalis, and Verbascum) were all very diverged. Repeated gene duplication and loss of elements in the Adh gene family is likely in these lineages, making it impossible to determine orthology of the Adh genes.

MLEs were detected in two related Tortricid moths, but not in another Ascogaster species. The MLEs of A. reticulatus and A. honmai were 97.6% identical in DNA sequence. This high similarity suggests a recent horizontal transfer, probably from the moth host to the wasp parasitoid, facilitated by the intimacy of the host-parasitoid relationship.

N2  - Impala is an active DNA transposon family that was first identified in a strain of Fusarium oxysporum pathogenic to melon. The 10 copies present in this strain define three subfamilies that differ by about 20% at the nucleotide level. This high level of polymorphism suggests the existence of an ancestral polymorphism associated with vertical transmission and/or the introduction of some subfamilies by horizontal transfer from another species. To gain insights into the molecular evolution of this family, impala distribution was investigated in strains with various host specificities by Southern blot, PCR, and sequencing. Detection of impala elements in most of the F. oxysporum strains tested indicates that impala is an ancient component of the F. oxysporum genome. Subfamily-specific amplifications and sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed five subfamilies, several of which can be found within the same genome. This supports the hypothesis of an ancestral polymorphism followed by vertical transmission and independent evolution in the host-specific forms. Highly similar elements showing unique features (internal deletions, high rates of CG-to-TA transitions) or being present at the same genomic location were identified in several strains with different host specificities, raising questions about the phylogenetic relationships of these strains. A phylogenetic analysis performed by sequencing a portion of the EF1α gene showed in most cases a correlation between the presence of a particular element and a close genetic relationship. All of these data provide important information on the evolutionary origin of this element and reveal its potential as a valuable tool for tracing populations.

N2  - While the maximum-likelihood (ML) method of tree reconstruction is statistically rigorous, it is extremely time-consuming for reconstructing large trees. We previously developed a hybrid method (NJML) that combines the neighbor-joining (NJ) and ML methods and thus is much faster than the ML method and improves the performance of NJ. However, we considered only nucleotide sequence data, so NJML is not suitable for handling amino acid sequence data, which requires even more computer time. NJML+ is an implementation of a further improved method for practical data analyses (including protein sequence data). Our extensive simulations using nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed that NJML+ gave good results in tree reconstruction. Indeed, NJML+ showed substantial improvements over existing methods in terms of both computational times and efficiencies, especially for amino acid sequence data. We also developed a "user-friendly" interface for the NJML+ program, including a simple tree viewer.

N2  - Although adequate resolution of higher-level relationships of organisms apparently requires longer DNA sequences than those currently being analyzed, limitations of time and resources present difficulties in obtaining such sequences from many taxa. For fishes, these difficulties have been overcome by the development of a PCR-based approach for sequencing the complete mitochondrial genome (mitogenome), which employs a long PCR technique and many fish-versatile PCR primers. In addition, recent studies have demonstrated that such mitogenomic data are useful and decisive in resolving persistent controversies over higher-level relationships of teleosts. As a first step toward resolution of higher teleostean relationships, which have been described as the "(unresolved) bush at the top of the tree," we investigated relationships using mitogenomic data from 48 purposefully chosen teleosts, of which those from 38 were newly determined during the present study (a total of 632,315 bp), using the above method. Maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood analyses were conducted with the data set that comprised concatenated nucleotide sequences from 12 protein-coding genes (excluding the ND6 gene and third codon positions) and 22 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes (stem regions only) from the 48 species. The resultant two trees from the two methods were well resolved and largely congruent, with many internal branches supported by high statistical values. The tree topologies themselves, however, exhibited considerable variation from the previous morphology-based cladistic hypotheses, with most of the latter being confidently rejected by the mitogenomic data. Such incongruence resulted largely from the phylogenetic positions or limits of long-standing problematic taxa, which were quite unexpected from previous morphological and molecular analyses. We concluded that the present study provided a basis of and guidelines for future investigations of teleostean evolutionary mitogenomics and that purposeful higher-density taxonomic sampling, subsequent sequencing efforts, and phylogenetic analyses of their mitogenomes may be decisive in resolving persistent controversies over higher-level relationships of teleosts, the most diversified group of all vertebrates, comprising over 23,500 extant species.

N2  - Sex chromosomes may provide a context for studying the local effects of mutation rate on molecular evolution, since the two types of sex chromosomes are generally exposed to different mutational environments in male and female germ lines. Importantly, recent studies of some vertebrates have provided evidence for a higher mutation rate among males than among females. Thus, in birds, the Z chromosome, which spends two thirds of its time in the male germ line, is exposed to more mutations than the female-specific W chromosome. We show here that levels of nucleotide diversity are drastically higher on the avian Z chromosome than in paralogous sequences on the W chromosome. In fact, no intraspecific polymorphism whatsoever was seen in about 3.4 kb of CHD1W intron sequence from a total of >150 W chromosome copies of seven different bird species. In contrast, the amount of genetic variability in paralogous sequences on the Z chromosome was significant, with an average pairwise nucleotide diversity (th) of 0.0020 between CHD1Z introns and with 37 segregating sites in a total of 3.8 kb of Z sequence. The contrasting levels of genetic variability on the avian sex chromosomes are thus in a direction predicted from a male-biased mutation rate. However, although a low gene number, as well as some other factors, argues against background selection and/or selective sweeps shaping the genetic variability of the avian W chromosome, we cannot completely exclude selection as a contributor to the low levels of variation on the W chromosome.

N2  - Phylogenetic relationships between 32 species of rodents representing 14 subfamilies of Muridae and four subfamilies of Dipodidae were studied using sequences of the nuclear protein-coding genes Lecithin Cholesterol Acyl Transferase (LCAT) and von Willebrand Factor (vWF). An examination of some evolutionary properties of each data matrix indicates that the two genes are rather complementary, with lower rates of nonsynonymous substitutions for LCAT. Both markers exhibit a wide range of GC3 percentages (55%-89%), with several taxa above 70% GC3 for vWF, which indicates that those exonic regions might belong to the richest class of isochores. The primary sequence data apparently harbor few saturations, except for transitions on third codon positions for vWF, as indicated by comparisons of observed and expected pairwise values of substitutions. Phylogenetic trees based on 1,962 nucleotidic sites from the two genes indicate that the 14 Muridae subfamilies are organized into five major lineages. An early isolation leads to the clade uniting the fossorial Spalacinae and semifossorial Rhizomyinae with a strong robustness. The second lineage includes a series of African taxa representing nesomyines, dendromurines, cricetomyines, and the sole living member of mystromyines. The third one comprises only the mouselike hamster Calomyscus. The fourth clade represents the cricetines, myospalacines, sigmodontines, and arvicolines, whereas the fifth one comprises four "traditional" subfamilies (Gerbillinae, Murinae, Otomyinae, and Acomyinae). Within these groups, we confirm the monophyly of almost all studied subfamilies, namely, Spalacinae, Rhizomyinae, Nesomyinae, Cricetomyinae, Arvicolinae, Sigmodontinae, Cricetinae, Gerbillinae, Acomyinae, and Murinae. Finally, we present evidence that the sister group of Acomyinae is Gerbillinae, and we confirm a nested position of Myospalacinae within Cricetinae and Otomyinae within Murinae. From a biogeographical point of view, the five main lineages spread and radiated from Asia with different degrees of success: the first three groups are now represented by a limited number of species and genera localized in some regions, whereas the last two groups radiated in a large variety of species and genera dispersed all over the world.

T1  - Local Similarity in Evolutionary Rates Extends over Whole Chromosomes in Human-Rodent and Mouse-Rat Comparisons: Implications for Understanding the Mechanistic Basis of the Male Mutation Bias

N2  - The sex chromosomes and autosomes spend different times in the germ line of the two sexes. If cell division is mutagenic and if the sexes differ in number of cell divisions, then we expect that sequences on the X and Y chromosomes and autosomes should mutate at different rates. Tests of this hypothesis for several mammalian species have led to conflicting results. At the same time, recent evidence suggests that the chromosomal location of genes on autosomes affects their rate of evolution at synonymous sites. This suggests a mutagenic source different from germ cell replication. To correctly interpret the previous estimates of male mutation bias, it is crucial to understand the degree and range of this local similarity. With a carefully chosen randomization protocol, local similarity in synonymous rates of evolution can be detected in human-rodent and mouse-rat comparisons. However, the synonymous-site similarity in the mouse-rat comparison remains weak. Simulations suggest that this difference between the mouse-human and the mouse-rat comparisons is not artifactual and that there is therefore a difference between humans and rodents in the local patterns of mutation or selection on synonymous sites (conversely, we show that the previously reported absence of a local similarity in nonsynonymous rates of evolution in the human-rodent comparison was a methodological artifact). We show that linkage effects have a long-range component: not one in a million random genomes shows such levels of autosomal heterogeneity. The heterogeneity is so great that more autosomes than expected by chance have rates of synonymous evolution comparable with that of the X chromosome. As autosomal heterogeneity cannot be owing to different times spent in the germ line, this demonstrates that the dominant determiner of synonymous rates of evolution is not, as has been conjectured, the time spent in the male germ line.

N2  - With whole-genome sequences being completed at an increasing rate, it is important to develop and assess tools to analyze them. Following annotation of the protein content of a genome, one can compare sequences with previously characterized homologous genes to detect novel functions within specific proteins in the evolution of the newly sequenced genome. One common statistical method to detect such changes is to compare the ratios of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) nucleotide substitution rates. Here, the effects of several parameters that can influence this calculation (sequence reconstruction method, phylogenetic tree branch length weighting, GC content, and codon bias) are examined. Also, two new alternative measures of adaptive evolution, the point accepted mutations (PAM)/neutral evolutionary distance (NED) ratio and the sequence space assessment (SSA) statistic are presented. All of these methods are compared using two sequence families: the recent divergence of leptin orthologs in primates, and the more ancient divergence of the deoxyribonucleoside kinase family. The examination of these and other measures to detect changes of gene function along branches of a phylogenetic tree will become increasingly important in the postgenomic era.

N2  - We use the patterns of homozygosity at multiple loci to distinguish between excess homozygosity caused by consanguineous mating and that due to undetected population subdivision (the Wahlund effect). Clarification of the underlying causes of excess homozygosity is of practical importance in explaining the occurrence of recessive genetic disorders and in forensic match probability calculations. We calculated a likelihood surface for two parameters: C, the proportion of the population practicing consanguinity, and θ, the genetic correlation due population subdivision. To illustrate the method, we applied it to multilocus genotypic data of two U.K. Asian populations, one practicing a high frequency of cousin marriage, and another in which caste endogamy was suspected. The method was able to successfully distinguish the different patterns of relatedness. The method also returned accurate estimates of C and θ using simulated data sets. We show how our method can be extended to allow for degrees of inbreeding closer than cousin unions, including selfing. With closer inbreeding, the relatedness of recent ancestors beyond the parents becomes an issue.

N2  - Lake Tanganyika harbors numerous endemic species of extremely diverse cichlid fish that have been classified into 12 major taxonomic groups known as tribes. Analysis of short interspersed element (SINE) insertion data has been acknowledged to be a powerful tool for the elucidation of phylogenetic relationships, and we applied this method in an attempt to clarify such relationships among these cichlids. We studied insertion patterns of 38 SINEs in total, 24 of which supported the monophyly of three clades. The other 14 loci revealed extensive incongruence in terms of the patterns of SINE insertions. These incongruencies most likely stem from a period of adaptive radiation. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is the extensive incomplete lineage sorting of alleles for the presence or absence of a SINE during successive speciation events which took place about 5-10 MYA. The present study is the first to report the successful application of the SINE method in demonstrating the existence of such possible "ancient" incomplete lineage sorting. We discuss the possibility that it might potentially be very difficult to resolve the species phylogeny of a group that radiated explosively, even by resolving the genealogies of more than 10 nuclear loci, as a consequence of incomplete lineage sorting during speciation.

N2  - Only three retrotransposons of the DIRS1 group have previously been described: DIRS1 from the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, PAT from the nematode Panagrellus redivivus, and Prt1 from the zygomycetous fungus Phycomyces blakesleeanus. Analyses of the reverse transcriptase sequences encoded by these elements suggest that they are related to the long terminal repeat (LTR) retroelements, such as the Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons and the vertebrate retroviruses. The DIRS1-group elements, however, have several unusual structural features which distinguish them from typical LTR elements: (1) they lack the capacity to encode DDE-type integrases or aspartic proteases; (2) they have open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown function; (3) they integrate without creating duplications of their target sites; and (4) although they are bordered by terminal repeats, these sequences differ from typical LTRs in that they are either inverted repeats or "split" direct repeats. Because of the small number of DIRS1-like elements described, and the unusual structures of these elements, little is known about their evolution, distribution, and replication mechanisms. Here, we report the identification of several new DIRS1-like retrotransposons, including elements from nematodes, sea urchins, fish, and amphibia. We also present evidence for the existence of DIRS1-like sequences in the human genome. In addition, we show that the lack of DDE-type integrase genes from elements of the DIRS1 group is explained by the finding that the previously uncharacterized ORFs of these elements encode proteins related to the site-specific recombinase of bacteriophage lambda. The presence of lambda-recombinase-like genes in DIRS1 elements also accounts for the lack of target-site duplications for these elements and may be related to the unusual structures of their terminal repeats.

N2  - By referring to the split coding sequence of the highly conserved α6-fucosyltransferase gene family (assumed to be representative of the common α2 and α6 fucosyltransferase gene ancestor), we have hypothesized that the monoexonic coding sequences of the present α2-fucosyltransferase genes have been shaped in mammals by several events of retrotransposition and/or duplication. In order to test our hypothesis, we determined the structure of the three bovine α2-fucosyltransferase genes (bfut1, bfut2, and sec1) and analyzed their characteristics compared with their human counterparts (FUT1, FUT2, and Sec1). We show that in mammals, a complex nonautonomous L1-retrotransposition event occurred within the locus of the α2-fucosyltransferase ancestor gene itself. A consequence of this event was the processing in Catarrhini of a Sec1 pseudogene via several point mutations.

N2  - Plant defense mechanisms have been the subject of intensive investigation. However, little is known about their long-term evolutionary dynamics. We investigated the molecular diversity of a wound-induced serine protease inhibitor, wip1, in the genus Zea, as well as the divergence of wip1 among four genera, Zea, Tripsacum, Sorghum, and Oryza, in order to gain insight into the long-term evolution of plant defense. The specific objectives of this study were to determine (1) whether wip1 has a history of positive or balancing selection, as has been shown for genes involved in plant defense against pathogens, and (2) if the evolutionary histories of wip1 inhibitory loops, which come into closest contact with proteases, differ from the evolutionary history of other parts of this gene. The Zea polymorphism data are consistent with a neutral evolutionary history. In contrast, relative-rate tests suggest a nonneutral evolutionary history. This inconsistency may indicate that selection acting on wip1 is episodic or that wip1 evolves in response to selection favoring novel alleles. We also detected significant heterogeneity in the evolutionary rates of the two inhibitory loops of wip1--one inhibitory loop is highly conserved, whereas the second has diverged rapidly. Because these two inhibitory loops are predicted to have very similar biochemical functions, the significantly different evolutionary histories suggest that these loops have different ecological functions.

N2  - Comparative mapping between the human and chicken genomes has revealed a striking conservation of synteny between the genomes of these two species, but the results have been based on low-resolution comparative maps. To address this conserved synteny in much more detail, a high-resolution human-chicken comparative map was constructed from human chromosome 15. Mapping, sequencing, and ordering of specific chicken bacterial artificial chromosomes has improved the comparative map of chromosome 15 (Hsa15) and the homologous regions in chicken with almost 100 new genes and/or expressed sequence tags. A comparison of Hsa15 with chicken identified seven conserved chromosomal segments between the two species. In chicken, these were on chromosome 1 (Gga1; two segments), Gga5 (two segments), and Gga10 (three segments). Although four conserved segments were also observed between Hsa15 and mouse, only one of the underlying rearrangement breakpoints was located at the same position as in chicken, indicating that the rearrangements generating the other three breakpoints occurred after the divergence of the rodent and the primate lineages. A high-resolution comparison of Gga10 with Hsa15 identified 19 conserved blocks, indicating the presence of at least 16 intrachromosomal rearrangement breakpoints in the bird lineage after the separation of birds and mammals. These results improve our knowledge of the evolution and dynamics of the vertebrate genomes and will aid in the clarification of the mechanisms that underlie the differentiation between the vertebrate species.

N2  - The recent sequencing of the complete genome of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has yielded about 30% of the predicted genes with no obvious counterparts in other organisms. These rapidly evolving genes remain largely unexplored. Here, we present evidence for a striking variability in an important Drosophila cell cycle regulator encoded by the gene roughex (rux) in closely related fly species. The unusual level of Rux protein variability indicates that there are very low overall constraints on amino acid substitutions. Despite the lack of sequence similarity, certain common features, including the presence of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal and a functionally important N-terminal RXL cyclin-binding motif, exist between Rux and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors of the Cip/Kip family. These results indicate that even some genes involved in key regulatory processes in eukaryotes evolve at extremely high rates.

N2  - Although molecular dating of cladogenetic events is possible, no molecular method has been described to date the acquisition of various tissues. Taking into account the specificity of the major protein in enamel in formation (amelogenin), we were able to develop such a method for enamel. Indeed, because the amelogenin protein is exclusively involved in enamel formation and mineralization and because it lacks pleiotropic effects, this protein is a good candidate to estimate the date of acquisition of this highly mineralized tissue. We searched DNA banks for similarities between the amelogenin sequence and other sequences. Similarities were found only to exon 2 of SPARC (osteonectin) in two protostomians and in eight deuterostomians, and to exon 2 of three SPARC-related deuterostomian genes (SC1, hevin, and QR1). The other amelogenin exons did not reveal significant similarities to other sequences. In these proteins, exon 2 mainly encodes the peptide signal that plays the essential role in enabling the protein to be ultimately localized in the extracellular matrix. We tested the significance of the exon 2 similarities. The observed values were always significantly higher than the expected randomly generated similarities. This demonstrates a common evolutionary origin of this exon. The phylogenetic analyses of exon 2 sequences indicated that exon 2 was duplicated to amelogenin from an ancestral SPARC sequence in the deuterostomian lineage before the duplication of deuterostomian SPARC and SC1/hevin/QR1. We were able to date the origin of the latter duplication at approximately 630 MYA. Therefore, amelogenin exon 2 was acquired before this date, in the Proterozoic, long before the so-called "Cambrian explosion," the sudden appearance of several bilateralian phyla in the fossil record at the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition. This sudden appearance has been often suggested to reflect intensive cladogenesis during this period. However, molecular dating of protostomian-deuterostomian divergence and of the cladogenesis among several major clades of Bilateralia lead to a different conclusion: many bilateralian clades were already present during the late Proterozoic. It has previously been proposed that these bilateralians were not mineralized and that they had low fossilization potential. Our results strongly suggest that late Proterozoic fossils possessing a mineralized tissue homologous to enamel might be found in the future.

N2  - Short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (SCAD) constitute a large and diverse family of ancient origin. Several of its members play an important role in human physiology and disease, especially in the metabolism of steroid substrates (e.g., prostaglandins, estrogens, androgens, and corticosteroids). Their involvement in common human disorders such as endocrine-related cancer, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer disease makes them an important candidate for drug targets. Recent phylogenetic analysis of SCAD is incomplete and does not allow any conclusions on very ancient divergences or on a functional characterization of novel proteins within this complex family. We have developed a 3D structure-based approach to establish the deep-branching pattern within the SCAD family. In this approach, pairwise superpositions of X-ray structures were used to calculate similarity scores as an input for a tree-building algorithm. The resulting phylogeny was validated by comparison with the results of sequence-based algorithms and biochemical data. It was possible to use the 3D data as a template for the reliable determination of the phylogenetic position of novel proteins as a first step toward functional predictions. We were able to discern new patterns in the phylogenetic relationships of the SCAD family, including a basal dichotomy of the 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17beta-HSDs). These data provide an important contribution toward the development of type-specific inhibitors for 17beta-HSDs for the treatment and prevention of disease. Our structure-based phylogenetic approach can also be applied to increase the reliability of evolutionary reconstructions in other large protein families.

N2  - White campion (Silene latifolia) is one of the few examples of plants with separate sexes and with X and Y sex chromosomes. The presence or absence of the Y chromosome determines which type of reproductive organs--male or female--will develop. Recently, we characterized the first active gene located on a plant Y chromosome, SlY1, and its X-linked homolog, SlX1. These genes encode WD-repeat proteins likely to be involved in cell proliferation. Here, we report the characterization of a novel Y-linked gene, SlY4, which also has a homolog on the X chromosome, SlX4. Both SlY4 and SlX4 potentially encode fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases. A comparative molecular analysis of the two sex-linked loci (SlY1/SlX1 and SlY4/SlX4) suggests selective constraint on both X- and Y-linked genes and thus that both X- and Y-linked copies are functional. Divergence between SlY4 and SlX4 is much greater than that between the SlY1 and SlX1 genes. These results suggest that, as for human XY-linked genes, the sex-linked plant loci ceased recombining at different times and reveal distinct events in the evolutionary history of the sex chromosomes.

N2  - Previous analysis of mitochondrial DNA polymorphism in the native range of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) demonstrated the occurrence of two highly divergent (2 Myr) maternal lineages with a well-defined geographical distribution. Analysis of both protein and immunoglobulin polymorphisms are highly concordant with this pattern of differentiation. However, the present analysis of nine polymorphic microsatellite loci (with a total of 169 alleles) in 24 wild populations reveals severe allele-size homoplasy which vastly underestimates divergence between the main groups of populations in Iberia. Nonetheless, when applied to more recent historical phenomena, this same data set not only confirms the occurrence of a strong bottleneck associated with the colonization of Mediterranean France but also suggests a two-step dispersal scenario that began with gene flow from northern Spain through the Pyrenean barrier and subsequent range expansion into northern France. The strength and appropriateness of applying microsatellites to more recent evolutionary questions is highlighted by the fact that both mtDNA and protein markers lacked the allelic diversity necessary to properly evaluate the colonization of France. The well-documented natural history of European rabbit populations provides an unusually comprehensive framework within which one can appraise the advantages and limitations of microsatellite markers in revealing patterns of genetic differentiation that have occurred across varying degrees of evolutionary time. The degree of size homoplasy presented in our data should serve as a warning to those drawing conclusions from microsatellite data sets which lack a set of complementary comparative markers, or involve long periods of evolutionary history, even within a single species.

N2  - The reliabilities of parsimony-based and likelihood-based methods for inferring positive selection at single amino acid sites were studied using the nucleotide sequences of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, in which positive selection is known to be operating at the antigen recognition site. The results indicate that the inference by parsimony-based methods is robust to the use of different evolutionary models and generally more reliable than that by likelihood-based methods. In contrast, the results obtained by likelihood-based methods depend on the models and on the initial parameter values used. It is sometimes difficult to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters for a given model, and the results obtained may be false negatives or false positives depending on the initial parameter values. It is therefore preferable to use parsimony-based methods as long as the number of sequences is relatively large and the branch lengths of the phylogenetic tree are relatively small.

N2  - We traced the sequence evolution of the active lineage of LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons over the last ~25 Myr of human evolution. Five major families (L1PA5, L1PA4, L1PA3B, L1PA2, and L1PA1) of elements have succeeded each other as a single lineage. We found that part of the first open-reading frame (ORFI) had a higher rate of nonsynonymous (amino acid replacement) substitution than synonymous substitution during the evolution of the ancestral L1PA5 through the L1PA3B families. This segment encodes the coiled coil region of the protein-protein interaction domain of the ORFI protein (ORFIp). Statistical analysis of these changes indicates that positive selection had been acting on this region. In contrast, the coiled coil segment hardly changed during the evolution of the L1PA3B to the present L1PA1 family. Therefore, selective pressure on the coiled coil segment has changed over time. We suggest that the fast rate of amino acid replacement in the coiled coil segment reflects the adaptation of L1 either to a changing genomic environment or to host repression factors. In contrast, the second open-reading frame and the nucleic acid-binding domain of the first open-reading frame are extremely well conserved, attesting to the strong purifying selection acting on these regions.

N2  - It is shown that in the genomes of warm-blooded vertebrates the elevation of genic GC-content is associated with an increase in the bendability of the DNA helix, which is both absolute and relative as compared with random sequences. This trend takes place both in exons and introns, being more pronounced in the latter. At the same time, the free energy of melting (delta G) of exons and introns increases only absolutely with elevation of GC-content, whereas it decreases as compared with random sequences (again, this trend is stronger in the introns). In genes of cold-blooded animals, plants, and unicellular organisms, these regularities are weaker and often not consistent. Generally, there is a negative correlation between bendability and melting energy at any fixed GC-content value. This effect is stronger in the introns. These findings suggest that GC-enrichment of genes in the homeotherm vertebrates can be caused by selection for increased bendability of DNA.

N2  - The nuclear large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene is a rich source of phylogenetic characters because of its large size, mosaic of slowly and rapidly evolving regions, and complex secondary structure variation. Nevertheless, many studies have indicated that inconsistency, bias, and gene-specific error (e.g., within-individual gene family variation, cryptic sequence simplicity, and sequence coevolution) can complicate animal phylogenies based on LSU rDNA sequences. However, most of these studies sampled small gene fragments from expansion segments--among animals only five nonchordate complete LSU sequences are published. In this study, we sequenced near-complete nuclear LSU genes from 11 representative daphniids (Crustacea). The daphniid expansion segment V6 was larger and showed more length variation (90-351 bp) than is found in all other reported LSU V6 sequences. Daphniid LSU (without the V6 region) phylogenies generally agreed with the existing phylogenies based on morphology and mtDNA sequences. Nevertheless, a major disagreement between the LSU and the expected trees involved a positively misleading association between the two taxa with the longest branches, Daphnia laevis and D. occidentalis. Both maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) optimality criteria recovered this association, but parametric simulations indicated that MP was markedly more sensitive to this bias than ML. Examination of data partitions indicated that the inconsistency was caused by increased nucleotide substitution rates in the branches leading to D. laevis and D. occidentalis rather than among-taxon differences in base composition or distribution of sites that are free to vary. These results suggest that lineage-specific rate acceleration can lead to long-branch attraction even in the conserved genes of animal species that are almost morphologically indistinguishable.

N2  - The evolution of the novel L2 clade of non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and their evolutionary dynamics in Deuterostomia has been examined. The short-term evolution of long interspersed nuclear element 2s (LINE2s) has been studied in 18 reptilian species by analysis of a PCR amplified 0.7-kb fragment encoding the palm/fingers subdomain of reverse transcriptase (RT). Most of the reptilian LINE2s examined are inactive since they contain multiple stop codons, indels, or frameshift mutations that disrupt the RT. Analysis of reptilian LINE2s has shown a high degree of sequence divergence and an unexpectedly large number of deletions. The evolutionary dynamics of LINE2s in reptiles has been found to be complex. LINE2s are shown to form a novel clade of non-LTR retrotransposons that is well separated from the CR1 clade. This novel L2 clade is more widely distributed than previously thought, and new representatives have been discovered in echinoderms, insects, teleost fishes, Xenopus, Squamata, and marsupials. There is an apparent absence of LINE2s from different vertebrate classes, such as cartilaginous fishes, Archosauria (birds and crocodiles), and turtles. Whereas the LINE2s are present in echinoderms and teleost fishes in a conserved form, in most tetrapods only highly degenerated pseudogenes can be found. The predominance of inactive LINE2s in Tetrapoda indicates that, in the host genomes, only inactive copies are still present. The present data indicate that the vertical inactivation of LINE2s might have begun at the time of Tetrapoda origin, 400 MYA. The evolutionary dynamics of the L2 clade in Deuterostomia can be described as a gradual vertical inactivation in Tetrapoda, stochastic loss in Archosauria and turtles, and strict vertical transmission in echinoderms and teleost fishes.

N2  - The wide geographic distribution of Schistosoma mansoni, a digenetic trematode and parasite of humans, is determined by the occurrence of its intermediate hosts, freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria (Preston 1910). We present phylogenetic analyses of 23 species of Biomphalaria, 16 Neotropical and seven African, including the most important schistosome hosts, using partial mitochondrial ribosomal 16S and complete nuclear ribosomal ITS1 and ITS2 nucleotide sequences. A dramatically better resolution was obtained by combining the data sets as opposed to analyzing each separately, indicating that there is additive congruent signal in each data set. Neotropical species are basal, and all African species are derived, suggesting an American origin for the genus. We confirm that a proto-Biomphalaria glabrata gave rise to all African species through a trans-Atlantic colonization of Africa. In addition, genetic distances among African species are smaller compared with those among Neotropical species, indicating a more recent origin. There are two species-rich clades, one African with B. glabrata as its base, and the other Neotropical. Within the African clade, a wide-ranging tropical savannah species, B. pfeifferi, and a Nilotic species complex, have both colonized Rift Valley lakes and produced endemic lacustrine forms. Within the Neotropical clade, two newly acquired natural hosts for S. mansoni (B. straminea and B. tenagophila) are not the closest relatives of each other, suggesting two separate acquisition events. Basal to these two species-rich clades are several Neotropical lineages with large genetic distances between them, indicating multiple lineages within the genus. Interesting patterns occur regarding schistosome susceptibility: (1) the most susceptible hosts belong to a single clade, comprising B. glabrata and the African species, (2) several susceptible Neotropical species are sister groups to apparently refractory species, and (3) some basal lineages are susceptible. These patterns suggest the existence of both inherent susceptibility and resistance, but also underscore the ability of S. mansoni to adapt to and acquire previously unsusceptible species as hosts. Biomphalaria schrammi appears to be distantly related to other Biomphalaria as well as to Helisoma, and may represent a separate or intermediate lineage.

N2  - In this study we have determined gap sequences from nine different spirochetes. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences in the context of all other available eubacterial and a selection of eukaryotic Gap sequences demonstrated that the eubacterial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene diversity encompasses at least five highly distinct gene families. Within these gene families, spirochetes show an extreme degree of sequence divergence that is probably the result of several lateral gene transfer events between spirochetes and other eubacterial phyla, and early gene duplications in the eubacterial ancestor. A Gap1 sequence from the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum has recently been shown to be closely related to GapC sequences from Euglenozoa. Here we demonstrate that several other spirochetal species are part of this cluster, supporting the conclusion that an interkingdom gene transfer from spirochetes to Euglenozoa must have occurred. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the GAPDH genes present in the protists Parabasalia may also be of spirochetal descent.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships of Trypanosoma cruzi strains were inferred using maximum-likelihood from complete 18S rDNA sequences and D7-24Sα rDNA regions from 20 representative strains of T. cruzi. For this we sequenced the 18S rDNA of 14 strains and the D7-24Sα rDNA of four strains and aligned them to previously published sequences. Phylogenies inferred from these data sets identified four groups, named Riboclades 1, 2, 3, and 4, and a basal dichotomy that separated Riboclade 1 from Riboclades 2, 3, and 4. Substitution models and other parameters were optimized by hierarchical likelihood tests, and our analysis of the 18S rDNA molecular clock by the likelihood ratio test suggests that a taxa subset encompassing all 2,150 positions in the alignment supports rate constancy among lineages. The present analysis supports the notion that divergence dates of T. cruzi Riboclades can be estimated from 18S rDNA sequences and therefore, we present alternative evolutionary scenarios based on two different views of T. cruzi intraspecific divergence. The first assumes a faster evolutionary rate, which suggests that the divergence between T. cruzi I and II and the extant strains occurred in the Tertiary period (37-18 MYA). The other, which supports the hypothesis that the divergence between T. cruzi I and II occurred in the Cretaceous period (144-65 MYA) and the divergence of the extant strains occurred in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era (65-1.8 MYA), is consistent with our previously proposed hypothesis of divergence by geographical isolation and mammalian host coevolution.

N2  - The fourth chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster lacks meiotic recombination. There is also a lack of nucleotide variation on the chromosome. This lack of variation could have been caused by a recent selective sweep, by background selection, or by a combination of these two forces. It should be possible to differentiate between the two mechanisms by studying the frequencies of polymorphic sites on the chromosome: a selective sweep should have resulted in low-frequency polymorphisms, whereas higher frequency polymorphisms would indicate the action of background selection. We have analyzed retrotransposable element insertions on the fourth chromosome in 11 strains of D. melanogaster. The polymorphisms found have a range of frequencies, with the presence of some insertions with high frequencies suggesting that the lack of variation is the result of background selection. We summarize the data using two statistics: the number of sites shared by more than one of the sample of 11 chromosomes (internal sites) and the mean number of transposable element differences in presence or absence between the sampled chromosomes. Simulations indicate that a selective sweep occurring more than 15,000 (0.03N) generations ago cannot be ruled out from the number of internal sites, although the number of differences between the chromosomes suggests either background selection or a sweep occurring more than 60,000 (0.12N) generations ago. Our results show no homoplasies and are thus consistent with no recombination occurring on the chromosome. The difficulties of distinguishing between the models using polymorphism data are discussed.

N2  - A comparative approach was taken for identifying amino acid substitutions that may be under positive Darwinian selection and are correlated with spectral shifts among orthologous and paralogous lepidopteran long wavelength-sensitive (LW) opsins. Four novel LW opsin fragments were isolated, cloned, and sequenced from eye-specific cDNAs from two butterflies, Vanessa cardui (Nymphalidae) and Precis coenia (Nymphalidae), and two moths, Spodoptera exigua (Noctuidae) and Galleria mellonella (Pyralidae). These opsins were sampled because they encode visual pigments having a naturally occurring range of λmax values (510-530 nm), which in combination with previously characterized lepidopteran opsins, provide a complete range of known spectral sensitivities (510-575 nm) among lepidopteran LW opsins. Two recent opsin gene duplication events were found within the papilionid but not within the nymphalid butterfly families through neighbor-joining, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses of 13 lepidopteran opsin sequences. An elevated rate of evolution was detected in the red-shifted Papilio Rh3 branch following gene duplication, because of an increase in the amino acid substitution rate in the transmembrane domain of the protein, a region that forms the chromophore-binding pocket of the visual pigment. A maximum likelihood approach was used to estimateω , the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions per site. Branch-specific tests of selection (free-ratio) identified one branch withω  = 2.1044, but the small number of substitutions involved was not significantly different from the expected number of changes under the neutral expectation ofω = 1. Ancestral sequences were reconstructed with a high degree of certainty from these data. Reconstructed ancestral sequences revealed several instances of convergence to the same amino acid between butterfly and vertebrate cone pigments, and between independent branches of the butterfly opsin tree that are correlated with spectral shifts.

N2  - Complete eukaryote chromosomes were investigated for intrachromosomal duplications of nucleotide sequences. The analysis was performed by looking for nonexact repeats on two complete genomes, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, and four partial ones, Drosphila melanogaster, Plasmodium falciparum, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Homo sapiens. Through this analysis, we show that all eukaryote chromosomes exhibit similar characteristics for their intrachromosomal repeats, suggesting similar dynamics: many direct repeats have their two copies physically close together, and these close direct repeats are more similar and shorter than the other repeats. On the contrary, there are almost no close inverted repeats. These results support a model for the dynamics of duplication. This model is based on a continuous genesis of tandem repeats and implies that most of the distant and inverted repeats originate from these tandem repeats by further chromosomal rearrangements (insertions, inversions, and deletions). Remnants of these predicted rearrangements have been brought out through fine analysis of the chromosome sequence. Despite these dynamics, shared by all eukaryotes, each genome exhibits its own style of intrachromosomal duplication: the density of repeated elements is similar in all chromosomes issued from the same genome, but is different between species. This density was further related to the relative rates of duplication, deletion, and mutation proper to each species. One should notice that the density of repeats in the X chromosome of C. elegans is much lower than in the autosomes of that organism, suggesting that the exchange between homologous chromosomes is important in the duplication process.

N2  - Mitochondrial genes are usually conserved in size in angiosperms. A notable exception is the rpl2 gene, which is considerably shorter in the eudicot Arabidopsis than in the monocot rice. Here, we show that a severely truncated mitochondrial rpl2 gene (termed 5' rpl2) was created by the formation of a premature stop codon early in eudicot evolution. This 5' rpl2 gene was subsequently lost many times from the mitochondrial DNAs of 179 core eudicots surveyed by Southern hybridization. The sequence corresponding to the 3' end of rice rpl2 (termed 3' rpl2) has been lost much more pervasively among the mitochondrial DNAs of core eudicots than has 5' rpl2. Furthermore, where still present in these mitochondrial genomes, 3' rpl2 always appears to be a pseudogene, and there is no evidence that 3' rpl2 was ever a functional mitochondrial gene. An intact and expressed 3' rpl2 gene was discovered in the nucleus of five diverse eudicots (tomato, cotton, Arabidopsis, soybean, and Medicago). In the first three of these species, 5' rpl2 is still present in the mitochondrion, unlike the two legumes, where both parts of rpl2 are present in the nucleus as separate genes. The full-length rpl2 gene has been transferred intact to the nucleus in maize. We propose that the 3' end of rpl2 was functionally transferred to the nucleus early in eudicot evolution, and that this event then permitted the nonsense mutation that gave rise to the mitochondrial 5' rpl2 gene. Once 5' rpl2 was established as a stand-alone mitochondrial gene, it was then lost, and was probably transferred to the nucleus many times. This complex history of gene fission and gene transfer has created four distinct types of rpl2 structures or compartmentalizations in angiosperms: (1) intact rpl2 gene in the mitochondrion, (2) intact gene in the nucleus, (3) split gene, 5' in the mitochondrion and 3' in the nucleus, and (4) split gene, both parts in the nucleus.

N2  - We present an intuitive visual framework, the generalized skyline plot, to explore the demographic history of sampled DNA sequences. This approach is based on a genealogy inferred from the sequences and provides a nonparametric estimate of effective population size through time. In contrast to previous related procedures, the generalized skyline plot is more applicable to cases where the underlying tree is not fully resolved and the data is not highly variable. This is achieved by the grouping of adjacent coalescent intervals. We employ a small-sample Akaike information criterion to objectively choose the optimal grouping strategy. We investigate the performance of our approach using simulation and subsequently apply it to HIV-1 sequences from central Africa and mtDNA sequences from red pandas.

N2  - Naked lobose amoebae (gymnamoebae) are among the most abundant group of protists present in all aquatic and terrestrial biotopes. Yet, because of lack of informative morphological characters, the origin and evolutionary history of gymnamoebae are poorly known. The first molecular studies revealed multiple origins for the amoeboid lineages and an extraordinary diversity of amoebae species. Molecular data, however, exist only for a few species of the numerous taxa belonging to this group. Here, we present the small-subunit (SSU) rDNA sequences of four species of typical large gymnamoebae: Amoeba proteus, Amoeba leningradensis, Chaos nobile, and Chaos carolinense. Sequence analysis suggests that the four species are closely related to the species of genera Saccamoeba, Leptomyxa, Rhizamoeba, Paraflabellula, Hartmannella, and Echinamoeba. All of them form a relatively well-supported clade, which corresponds to the subclass Gymnamoebia, in agreement with morphology-based taxonomy. The other gymnamoebae cluster in small groups or branch separately. Their relationships change depending on the type of analysis and the model of nucleotide substitution. All gymnamoebae branch together in Neighbor-Joining analysis with corrections for among-site rate heterogeneity and proportion of invariable sites. This clade, however, is not statistically supported by SSU rRNA gene sequences and further analysis of protein sequence data will be necessary to test the monophyly of gymnamoebae.

N2  - We have characterized the two families of SINE retroposons present in Arabidopsis thaliana. The origin, distribution, organization, and evolutionary history of RAthE1 and RAthE2 elements were studied and compared to the well-characterized SINE S1 element from Brassica. Our studies show that RAthE1, RAthE2, and S1 retroposons were generated independently from three different tRNAs. The RAthE1 and RAthE2 families are older than the S1 family and are present in all tested Cruciferae species. The evolutionary history of the RAthE1 family is unusual for SINEs. The 144 RAthE1 elements of the Arabidopsis genome cannot be classified in distinct subfamilies of different evolutionary ages as is the case for S1, RAthE2, and mammalian SINEs. Instead, most RAthE1 elements were probably derived steadily from a single source gene that was maintained intact and active for at least 12-20 Myr, a result suggesting that the RAthE1 source gene was under selection. The distribution of RAthE1 and RAthE2 elements on the Arabidopsis physical map was studied. We observed that, in contrast to other Arabidopsis transposable elements, SINEs are not concentrated in the heterochromatic regions. Instead, SINEs are grouped in the euchromatic chromosome territories several hundred kilobase pairs long. In these territories, SINE elements are closely associated with genes.

N2  - Because of functional constraints, substitution rates vary among the positions of a protein but are usually assumed to be constant at a given site during evolution. The distribution of the rates across the sequence positions generally fits a γ distribution. Models of sequence evolution were accordingly designed and led to improved phylogenetic reconstruction. However, it has been convincingly demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of a given position is not always constant throughout time. We called such within-site rate variations heterotachy (for "different speed" in Greek). Yet, heterotachy was found among homologous sequences of distantly related organisms, often with different functions. In such cases, the functional constraints are likely different, which would explain the different distribution of variable sites. To evaluate the importance of heterotachy, we focused on amino acid sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome b, for which the function is likely the same in all vertebrates. Using 2,038 sequences, we demonstrate that 95% of the variable positions are heterotachous, i.e., underwent dramatic variations of substitution rate among vertebrate lineages. Heterotachy even occurs at small evolutionary scale, and in these cases it is very unlikely to be related to functional changes. Since a large number of sequences are required to efficiently detect heterotachy, the extent of this phenomenon could not be estimated for all proteins yet. It could be as large as for cytochrome b, since this protein is not a peculiar case. The observations made here open several new avenues of research, such as the understanding of the evolution of functional constraints or the improvement of phylogenetic reconstruction methods.

N2  - Evolution of proteins is generally modeled as a Markov process acting on each site of the sequence. Replacement frequencies need to be estimated based on sequence alignments. Here we compare three approaches: First, the original method by Dayhoff, Schwartz, and Orcutt (1978) Atlas Protein Seq. Struc. 5:345-352, secondly, the resolvent method (RV) by Muller and Vingron (2000) J. Comput. Biol. 7(6):761-776, and finally a maximum likelihood approach (ML) developed in this paper. We evaluate the methods using a highly divergent and inhomogeneous set of sequence alignments as an input to the estimation procedure. ML is the method of choice for small sets of input data. Although the RV method is computationally much less demanding it performs only slightly worse than ML. Therefore, it is perfectly appropriate for large-scale applications.

N2  - In this paper we use hypothetical and empirical data matrices to evaluate the ability of relative apparent synapomorphy analysis (RASA) to measure phylogenetic signal, select outgroups, and identify terminals subject to long-branch attraction. In all cases, except for equal character-state frequencies, RASA indicated extraordinarily high levels of phylogenetic information for hypothetical data matrices that are uninformative regarding relationships among the terminals. Yet, regardless of the number of characters or character-state frequencies, RASA failed to detect phylogenetic signal for hypothetical matrices with strong phylogenetic signal. In our empirical example, RASA indicated increasing phylogenetic signal for matrices for which the strict consensus of the most parsimonious trees is increasingly poorly resolved, clades are increasingly poorly supported, and for which many relationships are in conflict with more widely sampled analyses. RASA is an ineffective approach to identify outgroup terminal(s) with the most plesiomorphic character states for the ingroup. Our hypothetical example demonstrated that RASA preferred outgroup terminals with increasing numbers of convergent character states with ingroup terminals, and rejected the outgroup terminal with all plesiomorphic character states. Our empirical example demonstrated that RASA, in all three cases examined, selected an ingroup terminal, rather than an outgroup terminal, as the best outgroup. In no case was one of the two outgroup terminals even close to being considered the optimal outgroup by RASA. RASA is an ineffective means of identifying problematic long-branch terminals. In our hypothetical example, RASA indicated a terminal as being a problematic long-branch terminal in spite of the terminal being on a zero-length branch and having no possibility of undergoing long-branch attraction with another terminal. RASA also failed to identify actual problematic long-branch terminals that did undergo long-branch attraction, but only after following Lyons-Weiler and Hoelzer's (1997) three-step process to identify and remove terminals subject to long-branch attraction. We conclude that RASA should not be used for any of these purposes.

T1  - The Complete Mitochondrial DNA Sequence of Mesostigma viride Identifies This Green Alga as the Earliest Green Plant Divergence and Predicts a Highly Compact Mitochondrial Genome in the Ancestor of All Green Plants

N2  - To gain insights into the nature of the mitochondrial genome in the common ancestor of all green plants, we have completely sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Mesostigma viride. This green alga belongs to a morphologically heterogeneous class (Prasinophyceae) that includes descendants of the earliest diverging green plants. Recent phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and concatenated proteins encoded by the chloroplast genome identified Mesostigma as a basal branch relative to the Streptophyta and the Chlorophyta, the two phyla that were previously thought to contain all extant green plants. The circular mitochondrial genome of Mesostigma resembles the mtDNAs of green algae occupying a basal position within the Chlorophyta in displaying a small size (42,424 bp) and a high gene density (86.6% coding sequences). It contains 65 genes that are conserved in other mtDNAs. Although none of these genes represents a novel coding sequence among green plant mtDNAs, four of them (rps1, sdh3, sdh4, and trnL[caa]) have not been reported previously in chlorophyte mtDNAs, and two others (rpl14 and trnI[gau]) have not been identified in the streptophyte mtDNAs examined so far (land-plant mtDNAs). Phylogenetic analyses of 19 concatenated mtDNA-encoded proteins favor the hypothesis that Mesostigma represents the earliest branch of green plant evolution. Four group I introns (two in rnl and two in cox1) and three group II introns (two in nad3 and one in cox2), two of which are trans-spliced at the RNA level, reside in Mesostigma mtDNA. The insertion sites of the three group II introns are unique to this mtDNA, suggesting that trans-splicing arose independently in the Mesostigma lineage and in the Streptophyta. The few structural features that can be regarded as ancestral in Mesostigma mtDNA predict that the common ancestor of all green plants had a compact mtDNA containing a minimum of 75 genes and perhaps two group I introns. Considering that the mitochondrial genome is much larger in size in land plants than in Mesostigma, we infer that mtDNA size began to increase dramatically in the Streptophyta either during the evolution of charophyte green algae or during the transition from charophytes to land plants.

N2  - Resting cysts of Sterkiella histriomuscorum (Ciliophora, Oxytrichidae) have been shown to contain messenger RNA, one of which codes for a protein significantly similar to CROC-1. CROC-1 is a human regulatory protein capable of transactivating the promoter of c-fos and belongs to a newly characterized family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) variants (UEV). We have determined the corresponding macronuclear gene sequence, which is the first protistan UEV sequence available. The phylogenetic analysis indicates the deep separation and solid clustering of all the UEV sequences within the E2 tree showing the ancient origin of these regulatory genes and their high structural conservation during evolution. Furthermore, overexpression of the ciliate UEV is able to rescue the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mms2 null mutant from killing by DNA damaging agents, implying that the UEV family proteins are functionally conserved. In S. histriomuscorum, expression of UEV is correlated with the growth of the cells as transcripts are present in excysting and vegetative cells but are rapidly down-regulated during starvation. These data support the high conservation of the UEV family in eukaryotes, and a regulatory role of the gene is discussed in relation to known functions of UEVs. This analysis may promote the search for homologues of other regulatory genes (metazoan regulators of differentiation) in ciliates.

T1  - Codon-Substitution Models to Detect Adaptive Evolution that Account for Heterogeneous Selective Pressures Among Site Classes

N2  - The nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) provides a sensitive measure of selective pressure at the protein level, with ω values <1, =1, and >1 indicating purifying selection, neutral evolution, and diversifying selection, respectively. Maximum likelihood models of codon substitution developed recently account for variable selective pressures among amino acid sites by employing a statistical distribution for the ω ratio among sites. Those models, called random-sites models, are suitable when we do not know a priori which sites are under what kind of selective pressure. Sometimes prior information (such as the tertiary structure of the protein) might be available to partition sites in the protein into different classes, which are expected to be under different selective pressures. It is then sensible to use such information in the model. In this paper, we implement maximum likelihood models for prepartitioned data sets, which account for the heterogeneity among site partitions by using differentω parameters for the partitions. The models, referred to as fixed-sites models, are also useful for combined analysis of multiple genes from the same set of species. We apply the models to data sets of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles from human populations and of the abalone sperm lysin genes. Structural information is used to partition sites in MHC into two classes: those in the antigen recognition site (ARS) and those outside. Positive selection is detected in the ARS by the fixed-sites models. Similarly, sites in lysin are classified into the buried and solvent-exposed classes according to the tertiary structure, and positive selection was detected at the solvent-exposed sites. The random-sites models identified a number of sites under positive selection in each data set, confirming and elaborating the results of the fixed-sites models. The analysis demonstrates the utility of the fixed-sites models, as well as the power of previous random-sites models, which do not use the prior information to partition sites.

N2  - Amino acids interact with each other, especially with neighboring amino acids, to generate protein structures. We studied the pattern of association and repulsion of amino acids based on 24,748 protein-coding genes from human, 11,321 from mouse, and 15,028 from Escherichia coli, and documented the pattern of neighbor preference of amino acids. All amino acids have different preferences for neighbors. We have also analyzed 7,342 proteins with known secondary structure and estimated the propensity of the 20 amino acids occurring in three of the major secondary structures, i.e., helices, sheets, and turns. Much of the neighbor preference can be explained by the propensity of the amino acids in forming different secondary structures, but there are also a number of intriguing association and repulsion patterns. The similarity in neighbor preference among amino acids is significantly correlated with the number of amino acid substitutions in both mitochondrial and nuclear genes, with amino acids having similar sets of neighbors replacing each other more frequently than those having very different sets of neighbors. This similarity in neighbor preference is incorporated into a new index of amino acid dissimilarities that can predict nonsynonymous codon substitutions better than the two existing indices of amino acid dissimilarities, i.e., Grantham's and Miyata's distances.

N2  - In some species, histone gene clusters consist of tandem arrays of each type of histone gene, whereas in other species the genes may be clustered but not arranged in tandem. In certain species, however, histone genes are found scattered across several different chromosomes. This study examines the evolution of histone 3 (H3) genes that are not arranged in large clusters of tandem repeats. Although H3 amino acid sequences are highly conserved both within and between species, we found that the nucleotide sequence divergence at synonymous sites is high, indicating that purifying selection is the major force for maintaining H3 amino acid sequence homogeneity over long-term evolution. In cases where synonymous-site divergence was low, recent gene duplication appeared to be a better explanation than gene conversion. These results, and other observations on gene inactivation, organization, and phylogeny, indicated that these H3 genes evolve according to a birth-and-death process under strong purifying selection. Thus, we found little evidence to support previous claims that all H3 proteins, regardless of their genome organization, undergo concerted evolution. Further analyses of the structure of H3 proteins revealed that the histones of higher eukaryotes might have evolved from a replication-independent-like H3 gene.

N2  - The NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding site plus leucine-rich repeat) genes represent the major class of disease resistance genes in flowering plants and comprise 166 genes in the ecotype Col-0 of Arabidopsis thaliana. NBS-LRR genes are organized in single-gene loci, clusters, and superclusters. Phylogenetic analysis reveals nine monophyletic clades and a few phylogenetic orphans. Most clusters contain only genes from the same phylogenetic lineage, reflecting their origin from the exchange of sequence blocks as a result of intralocus recombination. Multiple duplications increased the number of NBS-LRR genes in the progenitors of Arabidopsis, suggesting that the present complexity in Col-0 may derive from as few as 17 progenitors. The combination of physical and phylogenetic analyses of the NBS-LRR genes makes it possible to detect relatively recent gene rearrangements, which increased the number of NBS-LRR genes by about 50, but which are almost never associated with large segmental duplications. The identification of 10 heterogeneous clusters containing members from different clades demonstrates that sequence sampling between different resistance gene loci and clades has occurred. Such events may have taken place early during flowering plant evolution, but they generated modules that have been duplicated and remobilized also more recently.

N2  - In previous comparisons of enterobacterial sequences, synonymous substitution rates were higher in genes closer to the replication terminus, suggesting that mutation rates increase with distance from the replication origin. In order to directly test for the effects of chromosomal location on the rates of point mutations, we assayed the reversion rates of two lacZ alleles inserted at four positions in the Salmonella enterica chromosome. Mutation rates at an intermediate locus were significantly higher than those at loci nearer to and farther from the replication origin. The higher reversion rates at this locus were neither the result of an overall increase in mutation rates produced by the insertion at this location nor a function of the mutations' immediate neighbors, but rather a regional effect. At all loci, regardless of chromosome location, T·A → G·C transversions were more frequent than A·T → G·C transitions during the exponential phase.

N2  - The identification of inadvertently sequenced mitochondrial pseudogenes (numts) is critical to any study employing mitochondrial DNA sequence data. Failure to discriminate numts correctly can confound phylogenetic reconstruction and studies of molecular evolution. This is especially problematic for ribosomal mtDNA genes. Unlike protein-coding loci, whose pseudogenes tend to accumulate diagnostic frameshift or premature stop mutations, functional ribosomal genes are not constrained to maintain a reading frame and can accumulate insertion-deletion events of varying length, particularly in nonpairing regions. Several authors have advocated using structural features of the transcribed rRNA molecule to differentiate functional mitochondrial rRNA genes from their nuclear paralogs. We explored this approach using the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene and three known 12S numts from the human genome in the context of anthropoid phylogeny and the inferred secondary structure of primate 12S rRNA. Contrary to expectation, each of the three human numts exhibits striking concordance with secondary structure models, with little, if any, indication of their pseudogene status, and would likely escape detection based on structural criteria alone. Furthermore, we show that the unwitting inclusion of a particularly ancient (18-25 Myr old) and surprisingly cryptic human numt in a phylogenetic analysis would yield a well-supported but dramatically incorrect conclusion regarding anthropoid relationships. Though we endorse the use of secondary structure models for inferring positional homology wholeheartedly, we caution against reliance on structural criteria for the discrimination of rRNA numts, given the potential fallibility of this approach.

N2  - Rates of molecular evolution vary widely between lineages, but quantification of how rates change has proven difficult. Recently proposed estimation procedures have mainly adopted highly parametric approaches that model rate evolution explicitly. In this study, a semiparametric smoothing method is developed using penalized likelihood. A saturated model in which every lineage has a separate rate is combined with a roughness penalty that discourages rates from varying too much across a phylogeny. A data-driven cross-validation criterion is then used to determine an optimal level of smoothing. This criterion is based on an estimate of the average prediction error associated with pruning lineages from the tree. The methods are applied to three data sets of six genes across a sample of land plants. Optimally smoothed estimates of absolute rates entailed 2- to 10-fold variation across lineages.

N2  - We present a new likelihood method for detecting constrained evolution at synonymous sites and other forms of nonneutral evolution in putative pseudogenes. The model is applicable whenever the DNA sequence is available from a protein-coding functional gene, a pseudogene derived from the protein-coding gene, and an orthologous functional copy of the gene. Two nested likelihood ratio tests are developed to test the hypotheses that (1) the putative pseudogene has equal rates of silent and replacement substitutions; and (2) the rate of synonymous substitution in the functional gene equals the rate of substitution in the pseudogene. The method is applied to a data set containing 74 human processed-pseudogene loci, 25 mouse processed-pseudogene loci, and 22 rat processed-pseudogene loci. Using the informatics resources of the Human Genome Project, we localized 67 of the human-pseudogene pairs in the genome and estimated the GC content of a large surrounding genomic region for each. We find that, for pseudogenes deposited in GC regions similar to those of their paralogs, the assumption of equal rates of silent and replacement site evolution in the pseudogene is upheld; in these cases, the rate of silent site evolution in the functional genes is ~70% the rate of evolution in the pseudogene. On the other hand, for pseudogenes located in genomic regions of much lower GC than their functional gene, we see a sharp increase in the rate of silent site substitutions, leading to a large rate of rejection for the pseudogene equality likelihood ratio test.

All of the 19 identified genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand. The arrangement of these genes is remarkably similar to that of the oligochaete annelid Lumbricus terrestris. Comparison of both the inferred amino acid sequences and the gene arrangements of a variety of diverse metazoan taxa reveals that the phylum Sipuncula is more closely related to Annelida than to Mollusca. This requires reinterpretation of the homology of several embryological features and of patterns of animal body plan evolution.

N2  - The complete 12S ribosomal RNA(rRNA) sequences from 23 gobioid species and nine diverse assortments of other fish species were employed to establish a core secondary structure model for fish 12S rRNA. Of the 43 stems recognized, 41 were supported by at least some compensatory evidence among vertebrates. The rates of nucleotide substitution were lower in stems than in loops. This may produce less phylogenetic information in stems when recently diverged taxa are compared. An analysis of compensatory substitution shows that the percentage of covariation is 68%, and the weighting factor for phylogenetic analyses to account for the dependence of mutations should be 0.66. Different stem-loop weighting schemes applied to the analyses of phylogenetic relationships of the Gobioidei indicate that down-weighting paired regions because of nonindependence could not improve the present phylogenetic analysis. A biased nucleotide composition (adenine% [A%] > thymine% [T%], cytosine% [C%] > guanine% [G%]) in the loop regions was also observed in the mammalian counterpart. The excess of A and C in the loop regions may be because of the asymmetric mechanism of mtDNA replication, which leads to the spontaneous deamination of C and A. This process may also be responsible for a transition-transversion bias and the patterns of nucleotide substitutions in both stems and loops.

N2  - Here we report the discovery of a novel family of long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposons designated mtanga-Y, specific to the Y chromosome of the African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae. mtanga-Y elements represent the first Y-linked sequences and the first members of the Ty1-copia superfamily of retrotransposons described from this mosquito. Analysis of a full-length 4,284-bp element revealed the presence of two intact overlapping open reading frames bounded by LTRs of 119 bp. Evidence suggests that the elements are capable of retrotransposition, as transcripts and potential replication intermediates (one-LTR circles) were detected. However, the ~12 copies of mtanga-Y appear to be clustered rather than dispersed on the Y chromosome. Absent from the Y chromosome of four sibling species (A. arabiensis, A. quadriannulatus, A. melas, and A. merus), similar, but often defective, mtanga elements are present elsewhere in these genomes, as well as in A. gambiae. These data are consistent with a relatively recent invasion of the A. gambiae Y chromosome by an intact element. The presence of functional mtanga-Y elements suggests that the Y chromosome may be a source, not just a sink, for retrotransposons.

(Arthropoda: Diplopoda) and identified, in both genomes, all 37 genes typical for metazoan mtDNA. The arrangement of these genes is identical in the two millipedes, but differs from others found in arthropod mtDNAs in the location of at least four genes or gene blocks. This novel gene arrangement is unusual for animal mtDNA in that genes with identical transcriptional polarities are clustered in the genome, and the two clusters are separated by two noncoding regions. The only exception to this pattern is the gene for cysteine tRNA, which is located in the part of the genome that otherwise contains all genes with the opposite transcriptional polarity. We suggest that a mechanism involving complete mtDNA duplication followed by the loss of genes, predetermined by their transcriptional polarity and location in the genome, could generate this gene arrangement from the one ancestral for arthropods. The proposed mechanism has important implications for phylogenetic inferences that are drawn on the basis of gene arrangement comparisons.

N2  - A known phylogeny was generated using a four-step serial bifurcate PCR method. The ancestor sequence (SSU rDNA) evolved in vitro for 280 nested PCR cycles, and the resulting 15 ancestor and 16 terminal sequences (2,238 bp each) were determined. Parsimony, distance, and maximum likelihood analysis of the terminal sequences reconstructed the topology of the real phylogeny and branch lengths accurately. Divergence dates and ancestor sequences were estimated with very small error, particularly at the base of the phylogeny, mostly due to insertion and deletion changes. The substitution patterns along the known phylogeny are not described by reversible models, and accordingly, the probability substitution matrix, based on the observed substitutions from ancestor to terminal nodes along the known phylogeny, was calculated. This approach is an extension of previous studies using bacteriophage serial propagation, because here mutations were allowed to occur neutrally rather than by addition of a mutagenic agent, which produced biased mutational changes. These results provide for the first time biochemical experimental support for phylogenies, divergence date estimates, and an irreversible substitution model based on neutrally evolving DNA sequences. The substitution preferences observed here (A to G and T to C) are consistent with the high G+C content of the Thermus aquaticus genome. This suggests, at least in part, that the method here described, which explores the high Taq DNA polymerase error rate, simulates the evolution of a DNA segment in a thermophilic organism. These organisms include the bacterial rod T. aquaticus and several Archaea, and thus, the method and data set described here may well contribute new insights about the genome evolution of these organisms.

N2  - Nucleotide polymorphism in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) was studied in the gene encoding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (Pal, EC 4.3.1.5). Scots pine, like many other pine species, has a large current population size. The observed levels of inbreeding depression suggest that Scots pine may have a high mutation rate to deleterious alleles. Many Scots pine markers such as isozymes, RFLPs, and microsatellites are highly variable. These observations suggest that the levels of nucleotide variation should be higher than those in other plant species. A 2,045-bp fragment of the pal1 locus was sequenced from five megagametophytes each from a different individual from each of four populations, from northern and southern Finland, central Russia, and northern Spain. There were 12 segregating sites in the locus. The synonymous site overall nucleotide diversity was only 0.0049. In order to compare pal1 with other pine genes, sequence was obtained from two alleles of 11 other loci (total length 4,606 bp). For these, the synonymous nucleotide diversity was 0.0056. These estimates are lower than those from other plants. This is most likely because of a low mutation rate, as estimated from between-pine species synonymous site divergence. In other respects, Scots pine has the characteristics of a species with a large effective population. There was no linkage disequilibrium even between closely linked sites. This resulted in high haplotype diversity (14 different haplotypes among 20 sequences). This could also give rise to high per locus diversity at the protein level. Divergence between populations in the main range was low, whereas an isolated Spanish population had slightly lower diversity and higher divergence than the remaining populations.

N2  - Translation is carried out by the ribosome and several associated protein factors through three consecutive steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Termination remains the least understood of them, partly because of the nonuniversality of the factors involved. To get some insights on the evolution of eukaryotic translation termination, we have compared the phylogeny of the release factors eRF1 and eRF3 to that of the elongation factors EF-1α and EF-2, with special focus on ciliates. Our results show that these four translation proteins have experienced different modes of evolution. This is especially evident for the EF-1α, EF-2, and eRF1 ciliate sequences. Ciliates appear as monophyletic in the EF-2 phylogenetic tree but not in the EF-1α and eRF1 phylogenetic trees. This seems to be mainly because of phylogeny reconstruction artifacts (the long-branch attraction) produced by the acceleration of evolutionary rate of ciliate EF-1α and eRF1 sequences. Interaction with the highly divergent actin found in ciliates, or on the contrary, loss of interaction, could explain the acceleration of the evolutionary rate of the EF-1α sequences. In the case of ciliate eRF1 sequences, their unusually high evolutionary rate may be related to the deviations in the genetic code usage found in diverse ciliates. These deviations involve a relaxation (or even abolition) of the recognition of one or two stop codons by eRF1. To achieve this, structural changes in eRF1 are needed, and this may affect its evolutionary rate. Eukaryotic translation seems to have followed a mosaic evolution, with its different elements governed by different selective pressures. However, a correlation analysis shows that, beneath the disagreement shown by the different translation proteins, their concerted evolution can still be made apparent when they are compared with other proteins that are not involved in translation.

N2  - A typical immunoglobulin (Ig) molecule is composed of four polypeptide chains: two identical heavy (H) chains and two identical light (L) chains. This tetrameric structure is conserved in almost all jawed vertebrate species. However, it has been discovered that camels and llamas (family: Camelidae) possess a type of dimeric Ig that consists of two H chains only. These H chains do not associate with L chains, and they do not have the first constant region (CH1), which is present in the conventional Ig. In spite of these changes, the dimeric Ig maintains the normal immune function. To understand the evolution of the dimeric Ig, we studied the phylogenetic relationships of the variable region (VHH) genes of the dimeric Ig from Camelidae and those (VH) of the conventional Ig from mammals. The results showed that the VHH genes form a monophyletic cluster within one of the mammalian VH groups, group C. We examined the type of selective force in complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FRs) by comparing the rate of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitutions. We found that the results obtained from VHH genes were similar to those from VH genes in that CDRs showed an excess of dN over dS (indicating positive selection), whereas the reverse was true for FRs (purifying selection). However, when the extent of positive selection or purifying selection was investigated at each codon site, three major differences between VHH and VH genes were found. That is, very different types of selective force were observed between VHH and VH genes (1) at the sites that contact the L chain in the conventional Ig, (2) at the sites that interact with the CH1 region in the conventional Ig, and (3) in the H1 loop. Our findings suggest that adaptive evolution has occurred in the functionally important sites of the VHH genes to maintain the normal immune function in the dimeric Ig.

N2  - The Sp family of transcription factors binds GC-rich DNA sequences. The ubiquitously expressed Sp1 and Sp3 have been well characterized in mammals. Presented here is the characterization of the only Sp protein expressed in the liver or heart tissue of the teleost fish Fundulus heteroclitus. This protein, fSp3, is most similar to and homologous with mammalian Sp3 proteins. The evolution of the Sp transcription family is described, with Sp1 and Sp3 representing the most recent duplication of the Sp family. Sp4 appears to be the most ancestral member. Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 form a monophyletic group without Sp2. Sp2 is the least similar of the Sp family and is more similar to the non-Sp transcription factors. These results suggest that Sp2 should not be considered a member of the Sp family. Only two domains (zinc fingers and B domain) share similarity outside the Sp family. The zinc fingers are homologous to other GC-binding domains, yet the B domain is homologous to protein-protein interacting domains in the CCAAT-binding/NF-Y transcription factor families. These results suggest that these different domains have different evolutionary histories.

N2  - Surface glycoproteins are principal receptors used by pathogens to invade target cells. It has been suggested that mammalian erythrocyte surface glycoproteins function as decoy receptors attracting pathogens to the anucleated erythrocyte and away from their target tissues. Glycophorin A (GYPA) is solely expressed on the erythrocyte surface where it is the most abundant sialoglycoprotein, although its function is unknown. The pathogen decoy hypothesis may be relevant here, as GYPA has been shown in vitro to bind numerous viruses and bacteria, which do not infect erythrocytes. However, it is also a receptor for erythrocyte invasion by the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Analyses of gypa sequence variation among six higher primates and within a human population show that there is a large excess of replacement (nonsynonymous) substitutions along each primate lineage (particularly on exons 2-4 encoding the extracellular glycosylated domain of GYPA) and a significant excess of polymorphisms in exon 2 (encoding the terminal portion of the extracellular domain) within humans. These two signatures suggest that there has been exceptionally strong positive selection on this receptor driving GYPA divergence during primate evolution and balancing selection maintaining allelic variation within human populations. The pathogen decoy hypothesis alone is adequate to explain both these signatures of between-species and within-species diversifying selection. This has implications for understanding the functions of erythrocyte surface components and their roles in health and disease.

N2  - Deletion of the viral ligase gene drastically reduced the fitness of bacteriophage T7 on a ligase-deficient host. Viral evolution recovered much of this fitness during long-term passage, but the final fitness remained below that of the intact virus. Compensatory changes occurred chiefly in genes involved in DNA metabolism: the viral endonuclease, helicase, and DNA polymerase. Two other compensatory changes of unknown function also occurred. Using a method to distinguish compensatory mutations from other beneficial mutations, five additional substitutions from the recovery were shown to enhance adaptation to culture conditions and were not compensatory for the deletion. In contrast to the few previous studies of viral recovery from deletions, the compensatory changes in T7 did not restore the deletion or duplicate major regions of the genome. The ability of this deleted genome to recover much of the lost fitness via mutations in its remaining genes reveals a considerable evolutionary potential to modify the interactions of its elements in maintaining an essential set of functions.

N2  - Selfish genes of no function other than self-propagation are susceptible to degeneration if they become fixed in a population, and regular transfer to new species may be the only means for their long-term persistence. To test this idea we surveyed 24 species of yeast for VDE, a nuclear, intein-associated homing endonuclease gene (HEG) originally discovered in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Phylogenetic analyses show that horizontal transmission has been a regular occurrence in its evolutionary history. Moreover, VDE appears to be specifically adapted for horizontal transmission. Its 31-bp recognition sequence is an unusually well-conserved region in an unusually well-conserved gene. In addition, the nine nucleotide sites most critical for homing are also unusually well conserved. Such adaptation for horizontal transmission presumably arose as a consequence of selection, both among HEGs at different locations in the genome and among variants at the same location. The frequency of horizontal transmission must therefore be a key feature constraining the distribution and abundance of these genes.

N2  - Mobile genetic elements are ubiquitous throughout the eukaryote superkingdom. We have sequenced a highly unusual full-length retroelement from the Fugu fish, Takifugu rubripes. This element, which we have named Xena, is similar in structure and sequence to the Penelope retroelement from Drosophila virilis and consists of a single long open reading frame containing a reverse transcriptase domain flanked by identical direct long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences. These LTRs show an organization similar to the terminal repeats already described in the Penelope retrotransposon of Drosophila but are structurally and functionally distinct from the LTRs carried by LTR-retrotransposons. In view of their distinctness, we refer to these repeats as PLTRs (Penelope-LTRs). Whereas the element contains a reverse transcriptase, no other domains or motifs commonly associated with retroelements are present. In the full-length Fugu element, the 5' direct PLTR is preceded by an inverted PLTR fragment. Additional elements, many showing various degrees of deletion, are described from the Fugu genome and from that of the freshwater pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis. Many of these additional elements are also preceded by inverted PLTR sequences. Xena-like elements are also described from the genomes of several other organisms. The Penelope-Xena lineage is apparently a basal group within the retrotransposons and therefore represents an evolutionarily important class of retroelement.

N2  - We conducted a detailed analysis of duplicate genes in three complete genomes: yeast, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans. For two proteins belonging to the same family we used the criteria: (1) their similarity is ≥I (I = 30% if L ≥ 150 a.a. and I = 0.01n + 4.8L-0.32(1 + exp(-L/1000)) if L < 150 a.a., where n = 6 and L is the length of the alignable region), and (2) the length of the alignable region between the two sequences is ≥80% of the longer protein. We found it very important to delete isoforms (caused by alternative splicing), same genes with different names, and proteins derived from repetitive elements. We estimated that there were 530, 674, and 1,219 protein families in yeast, Drosophila, and C. elegans, respectively, so, as expected, yeast has the smallest number of duplicate genes. However, for the duplicate pairs with the number of substitutions per synonymous site (KS) < 0.01, Drosophila has only seven pairs, whereas yeast has 58 pairs and nematode has 153 pairs. After considering the possible effects of codon usage bias and gene conversion, these numbers became 6, 55, and 147, respectively. Thus, Drosophila appears to have much fewer young duplicate genes than do yeast and nematode. The larger numbers of duplicate pairs with KS < 0.01 in yeast and C. elegans were probably largely caused by block duplications. At any rate, it is clear that the genome of Drosophila melanogaster has undergone few gene duplications in the recent past and has much fewer gene families than C. elegans.

N2  - A molecular phylogeny of the rodent superfamily Cavioidea was derived using two nuclear sequences (exon #10 of the growth hormone receptor gene and intron #1 of the transthyretin gene) and one mitochondrial gene (12S rRNA). A combined analysis produced a highly derived and well-supported phylogenetic hypothesis that differed from traditional taxonomy primarily in the placement of two taxa. Kerodon, traditionally included within the subfamily Caviinae with guinea pigs and its relatives, is placed sister to the family Hydrochaeridae and closely aligned with the subfamily Dolichotinae. Inclusion of Hydrochaeris within the Caviidae renders the familial classification paraphyletic. Our data further support the taxonomic separation of the families Agoutidae and Dasyproctidae. Both the molecular and traditional morphological interpretations are assessed in testing an ecological constraints hypothesis regarding social behaviors. Whereas traditional taxonomy is consistent with an environmental constraints explanation for social behavior, the molecular data suggest that phylogenetic effects may be a more important factor in the evolution of social behavior in this group. Although lineage-specific rate heterogeneity was identified in all three molecular data sets, no significant support was obtained for the metabolic rate hypothesis. However, both nuclear genes displayed patterns in accordance with the generation time hypothesis.

N2  - We present a novel approach to deal with the problem of reconstructing the duplication history of tandemly repeated genes that are supposed to have arisen from unequal recombination. We first describe the mathematical model of evolution by tandem duplication and introduce duplication histories and duplication trees. We then provide a simple recursive algorithm which determines whether or not a given rooted phylogeny can be a duplication history and another algorithm that simulates the unequal recombination process and searches for the best duplication trees according to the maximum parsimony criterion. We use real data sets of human immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors to validate our methods and algorithms. Identity between most parsimonious duplication trees and most parsimonious phylogenies for the same data, combined with the agreement with additional knowledge about the sequences, such as the presence of polymorphisms, shows strong evidence that our reconstruction procedure provides good insights into the duplication histories of these loci.

N2  - Although the small-subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene is widely used in the molecular systematics, few large-subunit (LSU) rRNA gene sequences are known from protostome animals, and the value of the LSU gene for invertebrate systematics has not been explored. The goal of this study is to test whether combined LSU and SSU rRNA gene sequences support the division of protostomes into Ecdysozoa (molting forms) and Lophotrochozoa, as was proposed by Aguinaldo et al. (1997) (Nature 387:489) based on SSU rRNA sequences alone. Nearly complete LSU gene sequences were obtained, and combined LSU + SSU sequences were assembled, for 15 distantly related protostome taxa plus five deuterostome outgroups. When the aligned LSU + SSU sequences were analyzed by tree-building methods (minimum evolution analysis of LogDet-transformed distances, maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony) and by spectral analysis of LogDet distances, both Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa were indeed strongly supported (e.g., bootstrap values >90%), with higher support than from the SSU sequences alone. Furthermore, with the LogDet-based methods, the LSU + SSU sequences resolved some accepted subgroups within Ecdysozoa and Lophotrochozoa (e.g., the polychaete sequence grouped with the echiuran, and the annelid sequences grouped with the mollusc and lophophorates)--subgroups that SSU-based studies do not reveal. Also, the mollusc sequence grouped with the sequences from lophophorates (brachiopod and phoronid). Like SSU sequences, our LSU + SSU sequences contradict older hypotheses that grouped annelids with arthropods as Articulata, that said flatworms and nematodes were basal bilateralians, and considered lophophorates, nemerteans, and chaetognaths to be deuterostomes. The position of chaetognaths within protostomes remains uncertain: our chaetognath sequence associated with that of an onychophoran, but this was unstable and probably artifactual. Finally, the benefits of combining LSU with SSU sequences for phylogenetic analyses are discussed: LSU adds signal, it can be used at lower taxonomic levels, and its core region is easy to align across distant taxa--but its base frequencies tend to be nonstationary across such taxa. We conclude that molecular systematists should use combined LSU + SSU rRNA genes rather than SSU alone.

N2  - Life history has been implicated as a determinant of variation in rate of molecular evolution amongst vertebrate species because of a negative correlation between body size and substitution rate for many molecular data sets. Both the generality and the cause of the negative body size trend have been debated, and the validity of key studies has been questioned (particularly concerning the failure to account for phylogenetic bias). In this study, a comparative method has been used to test for an association between a range of life-history variables--such as body size, age at maturity, and clutch size--and DNA substitution rate for three genes (NADH4, cytochrome b, and c-mos). A negative relationship between body size and rate of molecular evolution was found for phylogenetically independent pairs of reptile species spanning turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodile, and tuatara. Although this study was limited by the number of comparisons for which both sequence and life-history data were available, the results suggest that a negative body size trend in rate of molecular evolution may be a general feature of reptile molecular evolution, consistent with similar studies of mammals and birds. This observation has important implications for uncovering the mechanisms of molecular evolution and warns against assuming that related lineages will share the same substitution rate (a local molecular clock) in order to date evolutionary divergences from DNA sequences.

N2  - We have sequenced the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Hyaloraphidium curvatum, an organism previously classified as a colorless green alga but now recognized as a lower fungus based on molecular data. The 29.97-kbp mitochondrial chromosome is maintained as a monomeric, linear molecule with identical, inverted repeats (1.43 kbp) at both ends, a rare genome architecture in mitochondria. The genome encodes only 14 known mitochondrial proteins, 7 tRNAs, the large subunit rRNA and small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA), and 3 ORFs. The SSU rRNA is encoded in two gene pieces that are located 8 kbp apart on the mtDNA. Scrambled and fragmented mitochondrial rRNAs are well known from green algae and alveolate protists but are unprecedented in fungi. Protein genes code for apocytochrome b; cytochrome oxidase 1, 2, and 3, NADH dehydrogenase 1, 2, 3, 4, 4L, 5, and 6, and ATP synthase 6, 8, and 9 subunits, and several of these genes are organized in operon-like clusters. The set of seven mitochondrially encoded tRNAs is insufficient to recognize all codons that occur in the mitochondrial protein genes. When taking into account the pronounced codon bias, at least 16 nuclear-encoded tRNAs are assumed to be imported into the mitochondria. Three of the seven predicted mitochondria-encoded tRNA sequences carry mispairings in the first three positions of the acceptor stem. This strongly suggests that these tRNAs are edited by a mechanism similar to the one seen in the fungus Spizellomyces punctatus and the rhizopod amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii. Our phylogenetic analysis confirms with overwhelming support that H. curvatum is a member of the chytridiomycete fungi, specifically related to the Monoblepharidales.

N2  - Chorionic gonadotropin (CG) is a critical signal in establishing pregnancy in humans and some other primates, but this placentally expressed hormone has not been found in other mammalian orders. The gene for one of its two subunits (CG β subunit [CGβ]) arose by duplication from the luteinizing hormone β subunit gene (LHβ), present in all mammals tested. In this study, 14 primate and related mammalian species were examined by Southern blotting and DNA sequencing to determine where in mammalian phylogeny the CGβ gene originated. Bats (order Chiroptera), flying lemur (order Dermoptera), strepsirrhine primates, and tarsiers do not have a CGβ gene, although they possess one copy of the LHβ gene. The CGβ gene first arose in the common ancestor of the anthropoid primates (New World monkeys, Old World monkeys, apes, and humans), after the anthropoids diverged from tarsiers. At least two subsequent duplication events occurred in the catarrhine primates, all of which possess multiple CGβ copies. The LHβ-CGβ family of genes has undergone frequent gene conversion among the catarrhines, as well as periods of strong positive selection in the New World monkeys (platyrrhines). In addition, newly generated DNA sequences from the promoter of the CG alpha subunit gene indicate that platyrrhine monkeys use a different mechanism of alpha gene expression control than that found in catarrhines.

N2  - Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is a protein with multiple functions. To infer its structure changes and evolution in vertebrates, we cloned cDNAs encoding PGI genes from hagfish (Paramyxine yangi), gray mullet (Mugil cephalus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), toad (Bufo melanosticus), and snake (Boiga kraepelini). Only one PGI gene was cloned in each of hagfish, toad, and snake, but two PGI genes were found in zebrafish and gray mullet, respectively. The PGI of hagfish encodes 554 amino acids, in contrast to the PGIs of bonyfishes, toad, and snake which encode 553 amino acids and the PGIs of mammals which encode 558 amino acids. Among 558 aligned amino acid sites, there are 314 sites (56.27%) totally conserved. To see if diversifying selection acts on PGI amino acids of vertebrates, we calculated the pairwise ratio of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitution per site (Ka/Ks) and the ratio of radical amino acid changes versus conservative amino acid changes per sites (dR/dC) between PGI sequences. The average pairwise ratio between nonsynonymous substitutions per nucleotide (Ka) and synonymous substitutions per nucleotide (Ks) among vertebrate PGI sequences equals 0.047 ± 0.019. The average pairwise ratio between radical amino acid changes and conservative amino acid changes (dR/dC) among the vertebrate PGIs equal 0.938 ± 0.158 for charge changes, 0.558 ± 0.085 for polarity changes, and 0.465 ± 0.0714 when both polarity and volume are considered. There is no amino acid within the vertebrate PGIs under diversifying selection as analyzed by the method of Yang et al. (2000b) . The results suggest that the present vertebrate PGIs are at evolutionary stasis and are being subjected to intense purifying selection. The purifying selection is to maintain polarity and volume of the protein but not the charge groups of amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that vertebrate PGIs can be classified into three major groups: the mammalian, amphibian-reptilian, and teleostean PGIs. The gene tree suggests that the gene duplication event of PGI in bonyfishes occurred before diversification of Acanthopterygii but after the split of bonyfishes and tetrapods. The evolution of multiple functions of PGI is discussed.

N2  - Sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (MyHC) is the major contractile protein of striated muscle. Six tandemly linked skeletal MyHC genes on chromosome 17 and two cardiac MyHC genes on chromosome 14 have been previously described in the human genome. We report the identification of three novel human sarcomeric MyHC genes on chromosomes 3, 7, and 20, which are notable for their atypical size and intron-exon structure. Two of the encoded proteins are structurally most like the slow-beta MyHC, whereas the third one is closest to the adult fast IIb isoform. Data from pairwise comparisons of aligned coding sequences imply the existence of ancestral genomes with four sarcomeric genes before the emergence of a dedicated smooth muscle MyHC gene. To further address the evolutionary relationships of the distinct sarcomeric and nonsarcomeric rod sequences, we have identified and further annotated human genomic DNA sequences corresponding to 14 class-II MyHCs. An extensive analysis provides a timeline for intron gain and loss, gene contraction and expansion, and gene conversion among genes encoding class-II myosins. One of the novel human genes is found to have introns at positions shared only with the molluscan catchin/MyHC gene, providing evidence for the structure of a pre-Cambrian ancestral gene.

N2  - The use of parameter-rich substitution models in molecular phylogenetics has been criticized on the basis that these models can cause a reduction both in accuracy and in the ability to discriminate among competing topologies. We have explored the relationship between nucleotide substitution model complexity and nonparametric bootstrap support under maximum likelihood (ML) for six data sets for which the true relationships are known with a high degree of certainty. We also performed equally weighted maximum parsimony analyses in order to assess the effects of ignoring branch length information during tree selection. We observed that maximum parsimony gave the lowest mean estimate of bootstrap support for the correct set of nodes relative to the ML models for every data set except one. For several data sets, we established that the exact distribution used to model among-site rate variation was critical for a successful phylogenetic analysis. Site-specific rate models were shown to perform very poorly relative to gamma and invariables sites models for several of the data sets most likely because of the gross underestimation of branch lengths. The invariable sites model also performed poorly for several data sets where this model had a poor fit to the data, suggesting that addition of the gamma distribution can be critical. Estimates of bootstrap support for the correct nodes often increased under gamma and invariable sites models relative to equal rates models. Our observations are contrary to the prediction that such models cause reduced confidence in phylogenetic hypotheses. Our results raise several issues regarding the process of model selection, and we briefly discuss model selection uncertainty and the role of sensitivity analyses in molecular phylogenetics.

N2  - A theoretical study of electron transfer (ET) pathways in a recently crystallized Clostridium acidurici ferredoxin is reported. The electronic structure of the protein complex is treated at the semiempirical extended Huckel level, and the tunneling pathways are calculated with the rigorous quantum mechanical method of tunneling currents. The model predicts two pathways between the two [4Fe-4S] cubanes: a strong one running directly from Cys14 to Cys43 and a weaker one from Cys14 via Ile23 to Cys18, whereas other amino acids do not play a significant role in the electron tunneling. The cysteine ligands conduct almost all of the current when Ile23 is mutated to valine in silico, so that there is no appreciable change in the ET rate. The calculated value of the transfer matrix element is consistent with the experimentally determined rate of transfer. Results of the sequence analysis performed on this ferredoxin reveal that Ile23 is a highly variable amino acid compared with the cubane-ligating cysteine amino acids, even though Ile23 lies directly between the donor and acceptor complexes. We further argue that the homologous proteins with a [3Fe-4S] cofactor, which does not have one of the four cysteine ligands, use the same tunneling pathways as those in this ferredoxin, on the basis of the high homology as well as the absolute conservation of Cys14 and Cys43 which serve as the main tunneling conduit. Our results explain why mutation of amino acids around and between the donor and acceptor cubane clusters, including that of Ile23, does not appreciably affect the rate of transfer and add support to the proposal that there exist evolutionarily conserved electron tunneling pathways in biological ET reactions.

N2  - Vertebrates possess multiple respiratory globins that differ in terms of structure, function, and tissue distribution. Three types of globins have been described so far: hemoglobin facilitates the transport of oxygen in the blood, myoglobin serves oxygen transport and storage in the muscle, and neuroglobin has a yet unidentified function in nerve cells. Here we report the identification of a fourth and novel type of globin in mouse, man, and zebrafish. It is expressed in apparently all types of human tissue and therefore has been called cytoglobin (CYGB). Mouse and human CYGBs comprise 190 amino acids; the zebrafish CYGB, 174 amino acids. The human CYGB gene is located on chromosome 17q25. The mammalian genes display a unique exon-intron pattern with an additional exon resulting in a C-terminal extension of the protein, which is absent in the fish CYGB. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the CYGBs had a common ancestor with vertebrate myoglobins. This indicates that the vertebrate myoglobins are in fact a specialized intracellular globin that evolved in adaptation to the special needs of muscle cells.

N2  - The jakobids are free-living mitochondriate protists that share ultrastructural features with certain amitochondriate groups and possess the most bacterial-like mitochondrial genomes described thus far. Jakobids belong to a diverse group of mitochondriate and amitochondriate eukaryotes, the excavate taxa. The relationships among the various excavate taxa and their relationships to other putative deep-branching protist groups are largely unknown. With the hope of clarifying these issues, we have isolated the cytosolic chaperonin CCTalpha gene from the jakobid Reclinomonas americana (strains 50394 and 50283), the jakobid-like malawimonad Malawimonas jakobiformis, two heteroloboseans (Acrasis rosea and Naegleria gruberi), a euglenozoan (Trypanosoma brucei), and a parabasalid (Monocercomonas sp.). We also amplified the CCTdelta gene from M. jakobiformis. The Reclinomonas and Malawimonas sequences presented here are among the first nuclear protein-coding genes to be described from these organisms. Unlike other putative early diverging protist lineages, a high density of spliceosomal introns was found in the jakobid and malawimonad CCTs--similar to that observed in vertebrate protein-coding genes. An analysis of intron positions in CCT genes from protists, plants, animals, and fungi suggests that many of the intron-sparse or intron-lacking protist lineages may not be primitively so but have lost spliceosomal introns during their evolutionary history. In phylogenetic trees constructed from CCTalpha protein sequences, R. americana (but not M. jakobiformis) shows a weak but consistent affinity for the Heterolobosea and Euglenozoa.

N2  - This paper examines the efficiency of the incongruence length difference test (ILD) proposed by Farris et al. (1994) for assessing the incongruence between sets of characters. DNA sequences were simulated under various evolutionary conditions: (1) following symmetric or asymmetric trees, (2) with various mutation rates, (3) with constant or variable evolutionary rates along the branches, and (4) with different among-site substitution rates. We first compared two sets of sequences generated along the same tree and under the same evolutionary conditions. The probability of a Type-I error (wrongly rejecting the true hypothesis of congruence) was substantially below the standard 5% level of significance given by the ILD test; this finding indicates that the choice of the 5% level is rather conservative in this case. We then compared two data sets, still generated along the same tree, but under different evolutionary conditions (constant vs. variable evolutionary rate, homogeneity vs. heterogeneity rate of substitution). Under these conditions, the probability of rejecting the true hypothesis of congruence was greater than the 5% given by the ILD test and increased with the number of sites and the degree to which the tree was asymmetric. Finally, the comparison of the two data sets, simulated under contrasting tree structures (symmetric vs. asymmetric) but under the same evolutionary conditions, led us to reject the hypothesis of congruence, albeit weakly, particularly when the number of informative sites was low and among-site substitution rate heterogeneous. We conclude that the ILD test has only limited power to detect incongruence caused by differences in the evolutionary conditions or in the tree topology, except when numerous characters are present and the substitution rate is homogeneous from site to site.

N2  - Diversifying selection drives the rapid differentiation of gene sequences and is one of the main forces behind adaptive evolution. Most genes known to be shaped by diversifying selection are those involved in host-pathogen or male-female interactions characterized as molecular "arms races." Here we report the unexpected detection of diversifying selection in the evolution of a tumor-growth promoter, angiogenin (ANG). A comparison among 11 primate species demonstrates that ANG has a significantly higher rate of nucleotide substitution at nonsynonymous sites than at synonymous sites, a hallmark of positive selection acting at the molecular level. Furthermore, we observed significant charge diversity at the molecular surface, suggesting the presence of selective pressures in the microenvironment of ANG, including its binding molecules. A population survey of ANG in chimpanzees, however, reveals no polymorphism, which may have resulted from a recent selective sweep of a charge-altering substitution in chimpanzee evolution. Functional assays of recombinant ANGs from the human and owl monkey indicate that primate ANGs retain angiogenic activity despite rapid evolution. Our study, together with findings of similar selection in the primate breast cancer suppressor gene, BRCA1, reveals an intriguing phenomenon of unusual selective pressures on, and adaptive evolution of, cancer-related genes in primate evolution.

N2  - A diverse group of animals has adapted to caves and lost their eyes and pigmentation, but little is known about how these animals and their striking phenotypes have evolved. The teleost Astyanax mexicanus consists of an eyed epigean form (surface fish) and at least 29 different populations of eyeless hypogean forms (cavefish). Current alternative hypotheses suggest that adaptation to cave environments may have occurred either once or multiple times during the evolutionary history of this species. If the latter is true, the unique phenotypes of different cave-dwelling populations may result from convergence of form, and different genetic changes and developmental processes may have similar morphological consequences. Here we report an analysis of variation in the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase 2 (ND2) gene among different surface fish and cavefish populations. The results identify a minimum of two genetically distinctive cavefish lineages with similar eyeless phenotypes. The distinction between these divergent forms is supported by differences in the number of rib-bearing thoracic vertebrae in their axial skeletons. The geographic distribution of ND2 haplotypes is consistent with roles for multiple founder events and introgressive hybridization in the evolution of cave-related phenotypes. The existence of multiple genetic lineages makes A. mexicanus an excellent model to study convergence and the genes and developmental pathways involved in the evolution of the eye and pigment degeneration.

N2  - The major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) form a large protein family of ancient origin and are found in bacteria, fungi, animals, and plants. MIPs act as channels in membranes to facilitate passive transport across the membrane. Some MIPs allow small polar molecules like glycerol or urea to pass through the membrane. However, the majority of MIPs are thought to be aquaporins (AQPs), i.e., they are specific for water transport. Plant MIPs can be subdivided into the plasma membrane intrinsic protein, tonoplast intrinsic protein, and NOD26-like intrinsic protein subfamilies. By database mining and phylogenetic analyses, we have identified a new subfamily in plants, the Small basic Intrinsic Proteins (SIPs). Comparisons of sequences from the new subfamily with conserved amino acid residues in other MIPs reveal characteristic features of SIPs. Possible functional consequences of these features are discussed in relation to the recently solved structures of AQP1 and GlpF. We suggest that substitutions at conserved and structurally important positions imply a different substrate specificity for the new subfamily.

N2  - Previous behavioral experiments showed that mouse salivary androgen-binding protein (ABP) was involved in interindividual recognition and might play a role in sexual isolation between house mouse (Mus musculus) subspecies. The pattern of evolution of Abpa, the gene for the alpha subunit of ABP, was found to be consistent with this hypothesis. Abpa apparently diverged rapidly between species and subspecies with a large excess of nonsynonymous substitutions, a lack of exon polymorphism within each of the three subspecies, and a lack of intron polymorphism in the one subspecies studied (M. musculus domesticus). Here we characterized the intron and exon sequence variations of this gene in house mouse populations from central Eurasia, a region yet unsampled and thought to be close to the cradle of the radiation of the subspecies. We also determined the intron and exon sequences in seven other species of the genus Mus. We confirmed the general pattern of rapid evolution by essentially nonsynonymous substitutions, both inter- and intraspecifically, supporting the idea that Darwinian selection has driven the evolution of this gene. We also observed a uniform intron sequence in five samples of M. musculus musculus, suggesting that a selective sweep might have occurred for that allele. In contrast to previous results, however, we found extensive intron and exon polymorphism in some house mouse populations from central Eurasia. We also found evidence for secondary admixture of the subspecies-specific alleles in regions of transition between the subspecies in central Eurasia. Furthermore, an abnormal intron phylogeny suggested that interspecific exchanges had occurred between the house mouse subspecies and three other Palearctic species. These observations appear to be at variance with the simple hypothesis that Abpa is involved in reproductive isolation. Although we do not rule out a role in recognition, the situation appears to be more complex than previously thought. Thus the selective mechanism behind the evolution of Abpa remains to be resolved, and we suggest that it may have changed during the recent colonization history of the house mouse.

N2  - The divergence of Drosophila pseudoobscura from its close relatives, D. persimilis and D. pseudoobscura bogotana, was examined using the pattern of DNA sequence variation in a common set of 50 inbred lines at 11 loci from diverse locations in the genome. Drosophila pseudoobscura and D. persimilis show a marked excess of low-frequency variation across loci, consistent with a model of recent population expansion in both species. The different loci vary considerably, both in polymorphism levels and in the levels of polymorphisms that are shared by different species pairs. A major question we address is whether these patterns of shared variation are best explained by gene flow or by persistence since common ancestry. A new test of gene flow, based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium, is developed. The results from these, and other tests, support a model in which D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis have exchanged genes at some loci. However, the pattern of variation suggests that most gene flow, although occurring after speciation began, was not recent. There is less evidence of gene flow between D. pseudoobscura and D. p. bogotana. The results are compared with recent work on the genomic locations of genes that contribute to reproductive isolation between D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. We show that there is a good correspondence between the genomic regions associated with reproductive isolation and the regions that show little or no evidence of gene flow.

N2  - Dinoflagellate chloroplast genes are unique in that each gene is on a separate minicircular chromosome. To understand the origin and evolution of this exceptional genomic organization we completely sequenced chloroplast psbA and 23S rRNA gene minicircles from four dinoflagellates: three closely related Heterocapsa species (H. pygmaea, H. rotundata, and H. niei) and the very distantly related Amphidinium carterae. We also completely sequenced a Protoceratium reticulatum minicircle with a 23S rRNA gene of novel structure. Comparison of these minicircles with those previously sequenced from H. triquetra and A. operculatum shows that in addition to the single gene all have noncoding regions of approximately a kilobase, which are likely to include a replication origin, promoter, and perhaps segregation sequences. The noncoding regions always have a high potential for folding into hairpins and loops. In all six dinoflagellate strains for which multiple minicircles are fully sequenced, parts of the noncoding regions, designated cores, are almost identical between the psbA and 23S rRNA minicircles, but the remainder is very different. There are two, three, or four cores per circle, sometimes highly related in sequence, but no sequence identity is detectable between cores of different species, even within one genus. This contrast between very high core conservation within a species, but none among species, indicates that cores are diverging relatively rapidly in a concerted manner. This is the first well-established case of concerted evolution of noncoding regions on numerous separate chromosomes. It differs from concerted evolution among tandemly repeated spacers between rRNA genes, and that of inverted repeats in plant chloroplast genomes, in involving only the noncoding DNA cores. We present two models for the origin of chloroplast gene minicircles in dinoflagellates from a typical ancestral multigenic chloroplast genome. Both involve substantial genomic reduction and gene transfer to the nucleus. One assumes differential gene deletion within a multicopy population of the resulting oligogenic circles. The other postulates active transposition of putative replicon origins and formation of minicircles by homologous recombination between them.

N2  - Influenza A, B, and C viruses are the etiological agents of influenza. Hemagglutinin (HA) is the major envelope glycoprotein of influenza A and B viruses, and hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) in influenza C viruses is a protein homologous to HA. Because influenza A virus pandemics in humans appear to occur when new subtypes of HA genes are introduced from aquatic birds that are known to be the natural reservoir of the viruses, an understanding of the origin and evolution of HA genes is of particular importance. We therefore conducted a phylogenetic analysis of HA and HE genes and showed that the influenza A and B virus HA genes diverged much earlier than the divergence between different subtypes of influenza A virus HA genes. The rate of amino acid substitution for A virus HAs from duck, a natural reservoir, was estimated to be 3.19 x 10-4 per site per year, which was slower than that for human and swine A virus HAs but similar to that for influenza B and C virus HAs (HEs). Using this substitution rate from the duck, we estimated that the divergences between different subtypes of A virus HA genes occurred from several thousand to several hundred years ago. In particular, the earliest divergence time was estimated to be about 2,000 years ago. Also, the A virus HA gene diverged from the B virus HA gene about 4,000 years ago and from the C virus HE gene about 8,000 years ago. These time estimates are much earlier than the previous ones.

N2  - To understand the evolution of Fot1, a member of the pogo family widely dispersed in ascomycetes, we have performed a phylogenetic survey across the genus Fusarium divided into six sections. The taxonomic distribution of Fot1 is not homogeneous but patchy; it is prevalent in the Fusarium oxysporum complex, absent in closely related sections, and found in five species from the most distant section Martiella. Multiple copies of Fot1 were sequenced from each strain in which the element occurs. In three species, the Fot1 nucleotide sequence is 98% identical to that from F. oxysporum (Fox), whereas nucleotide divergence for host genes is markedly higher: 11% for partial nuclear 28S rDNA and up to 30% for the gene encoding nitrate reductase (nia). In two species, sequence divergence of Fot1-related elements relative to Fox ranged from 7% to 23% (16% average). Most of the sequence differences (82%) were C-to-T and G-to-A transitions. These mutations are distributed throughout the Fot1 sequences, although they tend to be concentrated in the middle portion of the elements. Analysis of the local sequence context of transitions revealed a hierarchy of site preferences. These characteristics are typical of the repeat-induced point mutation process, first discovered in Neurospora crassa. The spotty distribution of Fot1 elements among species together with the high degree of similarity between Fot1 sequences present in distant species strongly suggests a case of horizontal transfer.

N2  - Are intron positions correlated with regions of high amino acid conservation? For a set of ancient conserved proteins, with intronless prokaryotic but intron-containing eukaryotic homologs, multiple sequence alignments identified residues invariant throughout evolution. Intron positions between codons show no preferences. However, introns lying after the first base of a codon prefer conserved regions, markedly in glycines. Because glycines are in excess in conserved regions, this behavior could reflect phase-one introns entering glycine residues randomly in the ancestral sequences. Examination of intron positions within codons of evolutionarily invariable amino acids showed that roughly 50% of these introns are bordered by guanines at both 5'- and 3'-ends, 25% have a G only before the intron, and 5% have a G only after the intron, whereas about 20% are bordered by nonguanine bases.

N2  - This study examines the intragenomic spread of the human endogenous retrovirus family HERV-W from insertions present within the draft sequence of the human genome. Identification of shared diagnostic differences and phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of three main subfamilies. The average divergence between sequences for each of the subfamilies suggests that most of the HERV-W elements were inserted within the genome during a short period of evolutionary time. Each one of the subfamilies consists of two types of insertions, the expected proviral sequences and other sequences resembling the structure of processed retrogenes. These HERV-W retrosequences extend from the R region of the 5' long-terminal repeat (LTR) to the R region of the 3' LTR (as viral genomic RNAs), end in poly(A) 3' tails, and are flanked by direct repeats longer than the proviral integrations. Furthermore, several of the HERV-W retrosequences are 5'-truncated at different sites. I suggest the involvement of the L1 machinery in these integrations and discuss the characteristic features of the evolutionary history of HERV-W, with emphasis on the putative impact of HERV-W retrosequence integrations on the mammalian genome.

N2  - This paper deals with phylogenetic inference when the variability of substitution rates across sites (VRAS) is modeled by a gamma distribution. We show that underestimating VRAS, which results in underestimates for the evolutionary distances between sequences, usually improves the topological accuracy of phylogenetic tree inference by distance-based methods, especially when the molecular clock holds. We propose a method to estimate the gamma shape parameter value which is most suited for tree topology inference, given the sequences at hand. This method is based on the pairwise evolutionary distances between sequences and allows one to reconstruct the phylogeny of a high number of taxa (>1,000). Simulation results show that the topological accuracy is highly improved when using the gamma shape parameter value given by our method, compared with the true (unknown) value which was used to generate the data. Furthermore, when VRAS is high, the topological accuracy of our distance-based method is better than that of a maximum likelihood approach. Finally, a data set of Maoricicada species sequences is analyzed, which confirms the advantage of our method.

N2  - Inconsistencies between phylogenetic interpretations obtained from independent sources of molecular data occasionally hamper the recovery of the true evolutionary history of certain taxa. One prominent example concerns the primate infraordinal relationships. Phylogenetic analyses based on nuclear DNA sequences traditionally represent Tarsius as a sister group to anthropoids. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data only marginally support this affiliation or even exclude Tarsius from primates. Two possible scenarios might cause this conflict: a period of adaptive molecular evolution or a shift in the nucleotide composition of higher primate mtDNAs through directional mutation pressure.  To test these options, the entire mt genome of Tarsius bancanus was sequenced and compared with mtDNA of representatives of all major primate groups and mammals. Phylogenetic reconstructions at both the amino acid (AA) and DNA level of the protein-coding genes led to faulty tree topologies depending on the algorithms used for reconstruction.  We propose that these artifactual affiliations rather reflect the nucleotide compositional similarity than phylogenetic relatedness and favor the directional mutation pressure hypothesis because: (1) the overall nucleotide composition changes dramatically on the lineage leading to higher primates at both silent and nonsilent sites, and (2) a highly significant correlation exists between codon usage and the nucleotide composition at the third, silent codon position. Comparisons of mt genes with mt pseudogenes that presumably transferred to the nucleus before the directional mutation pressure took place indicate that the ancestral DNA composition is retained in the relatively fossilized mtDNA-like sequences, and that the directed acceleration of the substitution rate in higher primates is restricted to mtDNA.

N2  - We recently developed a method for producing comprehensive gene and species phylogenies from unaligned whole genome data using singular value decomposition (SVD) to analyze character string frequencies. This work provides an integrated gene and species phylogeny for 64 vertebrate mitochondrial genomes composed of 832 total proteins. In addition, to provide a theoretical basis for the method, we present a graphical interpretation of both the original frequency matrix and the SVD-derived matrix. These large matrices describe high-dimensional Euclidean spaces within which biomolecular sequences can be uniquely represented as vectors. In particular, the SVD-derived vector space describes each protein relative to a restricted set of newly defined, independent axes, each of which represents a novel form of conserved motif, termed a correlated peptide motif. A quantitative comparison of the relative orientations of protein vectors in this space provides accurate and straightforward estimates of sequence similarity, which can in turn be used to produce comprehensive gene trees. Alternatively, the vector representations of genes from individual species can be summed, allowing species trees to be produced.

Furthermore, significant assortative mating was previously observed between populations of the two slopes. We used a set of 48 microsatellite markers to analyze patterns of genetic differentiation between D. melanogaster populations from both slopes and D. simulans. Consistent with previous reports, we found D. simulans to be well differentiated from D. melanogaster. Genetic differentiation between SFS and NFS D. melanogaster populations was low (FST = 0.0012). Also a tree of individuals based on the proportion of shared alleles and a model-based clustering method provided no evidence for population substructuring.

N2  - The class B floral homeotic genes from the higher eudicot model systems Arabidopsis and Antirrhinum are involved in specifying the identity of petals and stamens during flower development. These genes exist in two different types termed DEF- and GLO-like genes. The proteins encoded by the class B genes are stable and functional in the cell only as heterodimeric complexes of a DEF- and a GLO-like protein. In line with this, heterodimerization is obligate for DNA binding in vitro. The genes whose products have to heterodimerize to be stable and functional are each other's closest relatives within their genomes. This suggests that the respective genes originated by gene duplication, and that heterodimerization is of relative recent origin and evolved from homodimerization. To test this hypothesis we have investigated the dimerization behavior of putative B proteins from phylogenetic informative taxa, employing electrophoretic mobility shift assays and the yeast two-hybrid system. We find that an ancestral B protein from the gymnosperm Gnetum gnemon binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner as a homodimer. Of the two types of B proteins from the monocot Lilium regale, the GLO-like protein is still able to homodimerize, whereas the DEF-like protein binds to DNA only as a heterodimeric complex with the GLO-like protein. These data suggest that heterodimerization evolved in two steps after a gene duplication that gave rise to DEF- and GLO-like genes. Heterodimerization may have originated after the gymnosperm-angiosperm split about 300 MYA but before the monocot-eudicot split 140-200 MYA. Heterodimerization may have become obligate for both types of flowering plant B proteins in the eudicot lineage after the monocot-eudicot split.

N2  - Levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity vary widely among lineages. Because allopolyploid species contain duplicated (homoeologous) genes, studies of nucleotide diversity at homoeologous loci may facilitate insight into the evolutionary dynamics of duplicated loci. In this study, we describe patterns of sequence diversity from an alcohol dehydrogenase homoeologous locus pair (AdhC) in allotetraploid cotton (Gossypium, Malvaceae). These data are compared with equivalent information from another homoeologous alcohol dehydrogenase gene pair (AdhA, Small, Ryburn, and Wendel 1999 . Mol. Biol. Evol. 16:491-501) which has an overall slower evolutionary rate than AdhC. As expected from the predicted correlation between nucleotide diversity and evolutionary rate, nucleotide diversity was higher for AdhC than for AdhA. In addition, nucleotide diversity is higher in the D-subgenome of allotetraploid cotton for AdhC, confirming earlier observations for AdhA. These observations indicate that for these two pairs of Adh loci, the null hypothesis of equivalent evolutionary dynamics for duplicated genes in allotetraploid cotton is rejected.

N2  - Annexin A13 (ANXA13) is believed to be the original founder gene of the 12-member vertebrate annexin A family, and it has acquired an intestine-specific expression associated with a highly differentiated intracellular transport function. Molecular characterization of this subfamily in a range of vertebrate species was undertaken to assess coding region conservation, gene organization, chromosomal linkage, and phylogenetic relationships relevant to its progenitor role in the structure-function evolution of the annexin gene superfamily. Protein diagnostic features peculiar to this subfamily include an alternate isoform containing a KGD motif, an elevated basic amino acid content with polyhistidine expansion in the 5'-translated region, and the conservation of 15% core tetrad residues specific to annexin A13 members. The 12 coding exons comprising the 58-kb human ANXA13 gene were deduced from BAC clone sequencing, whereas internal repetitive elements and neighboring genes in chromosome 8q24.12 were identified by contig analysis of the draft sequence from the human genome project. A unique exon splicing pattern in the annexin A13 gene was corroborated by coanalysis of mouse, rat, zebrafish, and pufferfish genomic DNA and determined to be the most distinct of all vertebrate annexins. The putative promoter region was identified by phylogenetic footprinting of potential binding sites for intestine-specific transcription factors. Mouse annexin A13 cDNA was used to map the gene to an orthologous linkage group in mouse chromosome 15 (between Sdc2 and Myc by backcross analysis), and the zebrafish cDNA permitted its localization to linkage group 24. Comparative analysis of annexin A13 from nine species traced this gene's speciation history and assessed coding region variation, whereas phylogenetic analysis showed it to be the deepest-branching vertebrate annexin, and computational analysis estimated the gene age and divergence rate. The unique, conserved aspects of annexin A13 primary structure, gene organization, and genetic maps identify it as the probable common ancestor of all vertebrate annexins, beginning with the sequential duplication to annexins A7 and A11 approximately 700 MYA, before the emergence of chordates.

N2  - Mobile elements that use reverse transcriptase to make new copies of themselves are found in all major lineages of eukaryotes. The non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons have been suggested to be the oldest of these eukaryotic elements. Phylogenetic analysis of non-LTR elements suggests that they have predominantly undergone vertical transmission, as opposed to the frequent horizontal transmissions found for other mobile elements. One prediction of this vertical model of inheritance is that the oldest lineages of eukaryotes should exclusively harbor the oldest lineages of non-LTR retrotransposons. Here we characterize the non-LTR retrotransposons present in one of the most primitive eukaryotes, the diplomonad Giardia lamblia. Two families of elements were detected in the WB isolate of G. lamblia currently being used for the genome sequencing project. These elements are clearly distinct from all other previously described non-LTR lineages. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these Genie elements (for Giardia early non-LTR insertion element) are among the oldest known lineages of non-LTR elements consistent with strict vertical descent. Genie elements encode a single open reading frame with a carboxyl terminal endonuclease domain. Genie 1 is site specific, as seven to eight copies are present in a single tandem array of a 771-bp repeat near the telomere of one chromosome. The function of this repeat is not known. One additional, highly divergent, element within the Genie 1 lineage is not located in this tandem array but is near a second telomere. Four different telomere addition sites could be identified within or near the Genie elements on each of these chromosomes. The second lineage of non-LTR elements, Genie 2, is composed of about 10 degenerate copies. Genie 2 elements do not appear to be site specific in their insertion. An unusual aspect of Genie 2 is that all copies contain inverted repeats up to 172 bp in length.

N2  - Until recently, phylogenetic analyses of Archaea have mainly been based on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence comparisons, leading to the distinction of the two major archaeal phyla: the Euryarchaeota and the Crenarchaeota. Here, thanks to the recent sequencing of several archaeal genomes, we have constructed a phylogeny based on the fusion of the sequences of the 53 ribosomal proteins present in most of the archaeal species. This phylogeny was remarkably congruent with the rRNA phylogeny, suggesting that both reflected the actual phylogeny of the domain Archaea even if some nodes remained unresolved. In both cases, the branches leading to hyperthermophilic species were short, suggesting that the evolutionary rate of their genes has been slowed down by structural constraints related to environmental adaptation. In addition, to estimate the impact of lateral gene transfer (LGT) on our tree reconstruction, we used a new method that revealed that 8 genes out of the 53 ribosomal proteins used in our study were likely affected by LGT. This strongly suggested that a core of 45 nontransferred ribosomal protein genes existed in Archaea that can be tentatively used to infer the phylogeny of this domain. Interestingly, the tree obtained using only the eight ribosomal proteins likely affected by LGT was not very different from the consensus tree, indicating that LGT mainly brought random phylogenetic noise. The major difference involves organisms living in similar environments, suggesting that LGTs are mainly directed by the physical proximity of the organisms rather than by their phylogenetic proximity.

N2  - We have determined and compared the promoter, coding, and intronic sequences of the urate oxidase (Uox) gene of various primate species. Although we confirm the previous observation that the inactivation of the gene in the clade of the human and the great apes results from a single CGA to TGA nonsense mutation in exon 2, we find that the inactivation in the gibbon lineage results from an independent nonsense mutation at a different CGA codon in exon 2 or from either one-base deletion in exon 3 or one-base insertion in exon 5, contrary to the previous claim that the cause is a 13-bp deletion in exon 2. We also find that compared with other organisms, the primate functional Uox gene is exceptional in terms of usage of CGA codons which are prone to TGA nonsense mutations. Nevertheless, we demonstrate rather strong selective constraint against nonsynonymous sites of the functional Uox gene and argue that this observation is consistent with the fact that the Uox gene is unique in the genome and evolutionarily conserved not only among animals but also among eukaryotes. Another finding that there are a few substitutions in the cis-acting element or CAAT-box (or both) of primate functional Uox genes may explain the lowered transcriptional activity. We suggest that although the inactivation of the hominoid Uox gene was caused by independent nonsense or frameshift mutations, the gene has taken a two-step deterioration process, first in the promoter and second in the coding region during primate evolution. It is also argued that the high concentration of uric acid in the blood of humans and nonhuman primates has developed molecular coevolution with the xanthine oxidoreductase in purine metabolism. However, it remains to be answered whether loss of Uox activity in hominoids is related to protection from oxidative damage and the prolonged life span.

N2  - Processed genes are created by retroposition from messenger RNA of expressed genes. The estimated amount of processed copies of genes in the human genome is 10,000-14,000. Some of these might be pseudogenes with the expected pattern for nonfunctional sequences, but some others might be an important source of new genes. We have studied the evolution of a Phosphoglycerate mutase processed gene (PGAM3) described in humans and believed to be a pseudogene. We sequenced PGAM3 in chimpanzee and macaque and obtained polymorphism data for human coding region. We found evidence that PGAM3 likely produces a functional protein, as an example of addressing functionality for human processed pseudogenes. First, the open reading frame was intact despite many deletions that occurred in the 3' untranslated region. Second, it appears that the gene is expressed. Finally, interspecies and intraspecies variation for PGAM3 was not consistent with the neutral model proposed for pseudogenes, suggesting that a new functional primate gene has originated. Amino acid divergence was significantly higher than synonymous divergence in PGAM3 lineage, supporting positive selection acting in this gene. This role of selection was further supported by the excess of rare alleles in a population genetic analysis. PGAM3 is located in a region of very low recombination; therefore, it is conceivable that the rapid fixation events in this newly arising gene may have contributed to a selective sweep of variation in the region.

N2  - During the course of a random sequencing project of the genome of the dimorphic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, we have identified sequences that were repeated in the genome and that matched the reverse transcriptase (RT) sequence of non-long terminal repeat (non-LTR) retrotransposons. Extension of sequencing on each side of this zone of homology allowed the definition of an element over 6 kb long. The conceptual translation of this sequence revealed two open reading frames (ORFs) that displayed several characteristics of non-LTR retrotransposons: a Cys-rich motif in the ORF1, an N-terminal endonuclease, a central RT, and a C-terminal zinc finger domain in the ORF2. We called this element Ylli (for Y. lipolytica LINE). A total of 19 distinct repeats carrying the 3' untranslated region (UTR) and all ending with a poly-A tail were detected. Most of them were very short, 17 being 134 bp long or less. The number of copies of Ylli was estimated to be around 100 if these short repeats are 5' truncations. No 5' UTR was clearly identified, indicating that entire and therefore active elements might be very rare in the Y. lipolytica strain tested. Ylli does not seem to have any insertion specificity. Phylogenetic analysis of the RT domain unambiguously placed Ylli within the L1 clade. It forms a monophyletic group with the Zorro non-LTR retrotransposons discovered in another dimorphic yeast Candida albicans. BLAST comparisons showed that ORF2 of Ylli is closely related to that of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum L1 family, TRE.

N2  - We examined levels and patterns of the nucleotide polymorphism of the Amylase genes with a head-to-head duplication in Drosophila kikkawai. The levels of variation in D. kikkawai were comparable to those in Drosophila melanogaster. Tajima's test, Fu and Li's test, HKA test, and MK test did not show significant departure from neutrality. We found an excess of replacement changes in the within-locus class, representing polymorphism in one of the duplicated genes, compared with the between-locus class, representing polymorphism shared between the duplicated genes. Most replacement changes in the within-locus class were singletons. These results suggest that most replacement changes are deleterious. A contrasting evolutionary pattern, involving concerted evolution in the coding regions but differential evolution in the 5'-flanking regions, was observed. However, unlike the duplicated Amy genes of D. melanogaster, the coding regions of the duplicated genes in D. kikkawai tended to diverge. Using Ohta's model of the small multigene family, we found that recombination (interchromosomal equal crossing-over) rate was one order higher than gene conversion (unequal crossing-over) rate, resulting in a considerable but incomplete homogenization of the duplicated coding regions. Linkage disequilibria were found in the intron as well as within and around the regulatory cis-element sequences of one of the duplicated genes (Amy1). The possible causes of these linkage disequilibria were discussed.

N2  - Histones are small basic proteins encoded by a multigene family and are responsible for the nucleosomal organization of chromatin in eukaryotes. Because of the high degree of protein sequence conservation, it is generally believed that histone genes are subject to concerted evolution. However, purifying selection can also generate a high degree of sequence homogeneity. In this study, we examined the long-term evolution of histone H4 genes to determine whether concerted evolution or purifying selection was the major factor for maintaining sequence homogeneity. We analyzed the proportion (pS) of synonymous nucleotide differences between the H4 genes from 59 species of fungi, plants, animals, and protists and found that pS is generally very high and often close to the saturation level (pS ranging from 0.3 to 0.6) even though protein sequences are virtually identical for all H4 genes. A small proportion of genes showed a low level of pS values, but this appeared to be caused by recent gene duplication. Our findings suggest that the members of this gene family evolve according to the birth-and-death model of evolution under strong purifying selection. Using histone-like genes in archaebacteria as outgroups, we also showed that H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histone genes in eukaryotes form separate clusters and that these classes of genes diverged nearly at the same time, before the eukaryotic kingdoms diverged.

N2  - The concomitantly variable codons hypothesis of DNA substitution argues that at any time only a fraction of the codons in a gene are capable of accepting a mutation. However, as mutations are fixed at some positions in a gene, the sites that are potentially variable also change because of changed functional constraints. This hypothesis has been termed the "covarion" hypothesis or when the model is applied to nucleotides, the "covariotide" hypothesis. The covarion-covariotide model has proven to be remarkably difficult to test. Here I examine a covariotide hypothesis for 11 genes using a likelihood ratio test. I show that in nine of the genes examined a covariotide model provides a better explanation of the data than a model that does not allow constraints to change over time.

N2  - The performance of 14 different recombination detection methods was evaluated by analyzing several empirical data sets where the presence of recombination has been suggested or where recombination is assumed to be absent. In general, recombination methods seem to be more powerful with increasing levels of divergence, but different methods showed distinct performance. Substitution methods using summary statistics gave more accurate inferences than most phylogenetic methods. However, definitive conclusions about the presence of recombination should not be derived on the basis of a single method. Performance patterns observed from the analysis of real data sets coincided very well with previous computer simulation results. Previous recombination inferences from some of the data sets analyzed here should be reconsidered. In particular, recombination in HIV-1 seems to be much more widespread than previously thought. This finding might have serious implications on vaccine development and on the reliability of previous inferences of HIV-1 evolutionary history and dynamics.

N2  - α 1-Proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors that are involved in the regulation of a number of proteolytic processes. α1-PI, like most serpins, functions by covalent binding to, and inhibition of, target proteinases. The interaction between α1-PI and its target is directed by the so-called reactive center loop (RCL), an ~20 residue domain that extends out from the body of the α1-PI polypeptide and determines the inhibitor's specificity. Mice express at least seven closely related α1-PI isoforms, encoded by a family of genes clustered at the Spi1 locus on chromosome 12. The amino acid sequence of the RCL region is hypervariable among α1-PIs, a phenomenon that has been attributed to high rates of evolution driven by positive Darwinian selection. This suggests that the various isoforms are functionally diverse. To test this notion, we have compared the proteinase specificities of individual α1-PIs from each of the two mouse species. As predicted from the positive Darwinian selection hypothesis, the various α1-PIs differ in their ability to form covalent complexes with serine proteinases, such as elastase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and cathepsin G. In addition, they differ in their binding ability to proteinases in crude snake venoms. Importantly, the RCL region of the α1-PI polypeptide is the primary determinant of isoform-specific differences in proteinase recognition, indicating that hypervariability within this region drives the functional diversification of α1-PIs during evolution. The possible physiological benefits of α1-PI diversity are discussed.

N2  - It has been hypothesized that evolutionary changes will be more frequent in later ontogeny than early ontogeny because of developmental constraint. To test this hypothesis, a genomewide examination of molecular evolution through ontogeny was carried out using comparative genomic data in Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. We found that the mean rate of amino acid replacement is not significantly different between genes expressed during and after embryogenesis. However, synonymous substitution rates differed significantly between these two classes. A genomewide survey of correlation between codon bias and expression level found codon bias to be significantly correlated with mRNA expression (rs = -0.30 and P < 10-131) but does not alone explain differences in dS between classes. Surprisingly, it was found that genes expressed after embryogenesis have a significantly greater number of duplicates in both the C. elegans and C. briggsae genomes (P < 10-20 and P < 10-13) when compared with early-expressed and nonmodulated genes. A similarity in the distribution of duplicates of nonmodulated and early-expressed genes, as well as a disproportionately higher number of early pseudogenes, lend support to the hypothesis that this difference in duplicate number is caused by selection against gene duplicates of early-expressed genes, reflecting developmental constraint. Developmental constraint at the level of gene duplication may have important implications for macroevolutionary change.

N2  - We surveyed the molecular evolutionary characteristics of 11 nuclear genes from 10 conifer trees belonging to the Taxodioideae, the Cupressoideae, and the Sequoioideae. Comparisons of substitution rates among the lineages indicated that the synonymous substitution rates of the Cupressoideae lineage were higher than those of the Taxodioideae. This result parallels the pattern previously found in plastid genes. Likelihood-ratio tests showed that the nonsynonymous-synonymous rate ratio did not change significantly among lineages. In addition, after adjustments for lineage effects, the dispersion indices of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions were considerably reduced, and the latter was close to 1. These results indicated that the acceleration of evolutionary rates in the Cupressoideae lineage occurred in both the nuclear and plastid genomes, and that generally, this lineage effect affected synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions similarly. We also investigated the relationship of synonymous substitution rates with the nonsynonymous substitution rate, base composition, and codon bias in each lineage. Synonymous substitution rates were positively correlated with nonsynonymous substitution rates and GC content at third codon positions, but synonymous substitution rates were not correlated with codon bias. Finally, we tested the possibility of positive selection at the protein level, using maximum likelihood models, assuming heterogeneous nonsynonymous-synonymous rate ratios among codon (amino acid) sites. Although we did not detect strong evidence of positively selected codon sites, the analysis suggested that significant variation in nonsynonymous-synonymous rate ratio exists among the sites. The most likely sites for action of positive selection were found in the ferredoxin gene, which is an important component of the apparatus for photosynthesis.

N2  - A unified understanding of >390 Myr of insect evolution requires insight into their origin. Molecular clocks are widely applied for evolutionary dating, but clocks for the class Insecta have remained elusive. We now define a robust nucleotide and amino acid mitochondrial molecular clock encompassing five insect orders, including the Blattaria (cockroaches), Orthoptera (crickets and locusts), Hemiptera (true bugs), Diptera, and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Calibration of the clock using one of the earliest, most extensive fossil records for insects (the early ancestors of extant Blattaria) was congruent with all available insect fossils, with biogeographic history, with the Cambrian explosion, and with independent dating estimates from Lepidopteran families. In addition, dates obtained from both nucleotide and amino acid clocks were congruent with each other.  Of particular interest to vector biology is the early date of the emergence of triatomine bugs (99.8-93.5 MYA), coincident with the formation of the South American continent during the breakup of Gondwanaland. More generally, we reveal the insects arising from a common ancestor with the Anostraca (fairy shrimps) at around the Silurian-Ordovician boundary (434.2-421.1 MYA) coinciding with the earliest plant megafossil. We explore Tilyard's theory proposing that the terrestrial transition of the aquatic arthropod ancestor to the insects is associated with a particular plant group (early vascular plants). The major output of the study is a comprehensive series of dates for deep-branching points within insect evolution that can act as calibration points for further dating studies within insect families and genera.

N2  - We investigated evolutionary relationships among deuterostome subgroups by obtaining nearly complete large-subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA)-gene sequences for 14 deuterostomes and 3 protostomes and complete small-subunit (SSU) rRNA-gene sequences for five of these animals. With the addition of previously published sequences, we compared 28 taxa using three different data sets (LSU only, SSU only, and combined LSU + SSU) under minimum evolution (with LogDet distances), maximum likelihood, and maximum parsimony optimality criteria. Additionally, we analyzed the combined LSU + SSU sequences with spectral analysis of LogDet distances, a technique that measures the amount of support and conflict within the data for every possible grouping of taxa. Overall, we found that (1) the LSU genes produced a tree very similar to the SSU gene tree, (2) adding LSU to SSU sequences strengthened the bootstrap support for many groups above the SSU-only values (e.g., hemichordates plus echinoderms as Ambulacraria; lancelets as the sister group to vertebrates), (3) LSU sequences did not support SSU-based hypotheses of pterobranchs evolving from enteropneusts and thaliaceans evolving from ascidians, and (4) the combined LSU + SSU data are ambiguous about the monophyly of chordates. No tree-building algorithm united urochordates conclusively with other chordates, although spectral analysis did so, providing our only evidence for chordate monophyly. With spectral analysis, we also evaluated several major hypotheses of deuterostome phylogeny that were constructed from morphological, embryological, and paleontological evidence. Our rRNA-gene analysis refutes most of these hypotheses and thus advocates a rethinking of chordate and vertebrate origins.

N2  - We present the first molecular phylogenetic examination of the evolutionary position of retortamonads, a group of mitochondrion-lacking flagellates usually found as commensals of the intestinal tracts of vertebrates. Our phylogenies include small subunit ribosomal gene sequences from six retortamonad isolates--four from mammals and two from amphibians. All six sequences were highly similar (95%-99%), with those from mammals being almost identical to each other. All phylogenetic methods utilized unequivocally placed retortamonads with another amitochondriate group, the diplomonads. Surprisingly, all methods weakly supported a position for retortamonads cladistically within diplomonads, as the sister group to Giardia. This position would conflict with a single origin and uniform retention of the doubled-cell organization displayed by most diplomonads, but not by retortamonads. Diplomonad monophyly was not rejected by Shimodaira-Hasegawa, Kishino-Hasegawa, and expected likelihood weights methods but was marginally rejected by parametric bootstrapping. Analyses with additional phylogenetic markers are needed to test this controversial branching order within the retortamonad + diplomonad clade. Nevertheless, the robust phylogenetic association between diplomonads and retortamonads suggests that they share an amitochondriate ancestor. Because strong evidence indicates that diplomonads have secondarily lost their mitochondria (rather than being ancestrally amitochondriate), our results imply that retortamonads are also secondarily amitochondriate. Of the various groups of eukaryotes originally suggested to be primitively amitochondriate under the archezoa hypothesis, all have now been found to have physical or genetic mitochondrial relics (or both) or form a robust clade with an organism with such a relic.

N2  - Our thesis is that the DNA composition and structure of genomes are selected in part by mutation bias (GC pressure) and in part by ecology. To illustrate this point, we compare and contrast the oligonucleotide composition and the mosaic structure in 36 complete genomes and in 27 long genomic sequences from archaea and eubacteria. We report the following findings (1) High-GC-content genomes show a large underrepresentation of short distances between Gn and Cn homopolymers with respect to distances between An and Tn homopolymers; we discuss selection versus mutation bias hypotheses. (2) The oligonucleotide compositions of the genomes of Neisseria (meningitidis and gonorrhoea), Helicobacter pylori and Rhodobacter capsulatus are more biased than the other sequenced genomes. (3) The genomes of free-living species or nonchronic pathogens show more mosaic-like structure than genomes of chronic pathogens or intracellular symbionts. (4) Genome mosaicity of intracellular parasites has a maximum corresponding to the average gene length; in the genomes of free-living and nonchronic pathogens the maximum occurs at larger length scales. This suggests that free-living species can incorporate large pieces of DNA from the environment, whereas for intracellular parasites there are recombination events between homologous genes. We discuss the consequences in terms of evolution of genome size. (5) Intracellular symbionts and obligate pathogens show small, but not zero, amount of chromosome mosaicity, suggesting that recombination events occur in these species.

N2  - Characterization of seven MADS-box genes, termed PPM1-PPM4 and PpMADS1-PpMADS3, from the moss model species Physcomitrella patens is reported. Phylogeny reconstructions and comparison of exon-intron structures revealed that the genes described here represent two different classes of homologous, yet distinct, MIKC-type MADS-box genes, termed MIKCc-type genes--"c" stands for "classic"--(PPM1, PPM2, PpMADS1) and MIKC*-type genes (PPM3, PPM4, PpMADS2, PpMADS3). The two gene classes deviate from each other in a characteristic way, especially in a sequence stretch termed intervening region. MIKCc-type genes are abundantly present in all land plants which have been investigated in this respect, and give rise to well-known gene types such as floral meristem and organ identity genes. In contrast, LAMB1 from the clubmoss Lycopodium annotinum was identified as the only other MIKC*-type gene published so far. Our findings strongly suggest that the most recent common ancestor of mosses and vascular plants contained at least one MIKCc-type and one MIKC*-type gene. Our studies thus reveal an ancient duplication of an MIKC-type gene that occurred before the separation of the lineages that led to extant mosses and vascular plants more than about 450 MYA. The identification of bona fide K-domains in both MIKC*-type and MIKCc-type proteins suggests that the K-domain is more ancient than is suggested by a recent alternative hypothesis. MIKC*-type genes may have escaped identification in ferns and seed plants so far. It seems more likely, however, that they represent a class of genes which has been lost in the lineage which led to extant ferns and seed plants. The high number of P. patens MADS-box genes and the presence of a K-box in the coding region and of some potential binding sites for MADS-domain proteins and other transcription factors in the putative promoter regions of these genes suggest that MADS-box genes in mosses are involved in complex gene regulatory networks similar to those in flowering plants.

N2  - In the animal kingdom the enzymes that catalyze the formation of α1,4 fucosylated-glycoconjugates are known only in apes (chimpanzee) and humans. They are encoded by FUT3 and FUT5 genes, two members of the Lewis FUT5-FUT3-FUT6 gene cluster, which had originated by duplications of an α3 ancestor gene. In order to explore more precisely the emergence of the α1,4 fucosylation, new Lewis-like fucosyltransferase genes were studied in species belonging to the three main primate groups. Two Lewis-like genes were found in brown and ruffed lemurs (prosimians) as well as in squirrel monkey (New World monkey). In the latter, one gene encodes an enzyme which transfers fucose only in α1,3 linkage, whereas the other is a pseudogene. Three genes homologous to chimpanzee and human Lewis genes were identified in rhesus macaque (Old World monkey), and only one encodes an α3/4-fucosyltransferase. The ability of new primate enzymes to transfer fucose in α1,3 or α1,3/4 linkage confirms that the amino acid R or W in the acceptor-binding motif "HH(R/W)(D/E)" is required for the type 1/type 2 acceptor specificity. Expression of rhesus macaque genes proved that fucose transfer in α1,4 linkage is not restricted to the hominoid family and may be extended to other Old World monkeys. Moreover, the presence of only one enzyme supporting the α1,4 fucosylation in rhesus macaque versus two enzymes in hominoids suggests that this function occurred twice independently during primate evolution.

N2  - The evolutionary relationship between self-incompatibility systems in different families of flowering plants has long been a topic of interest. Physiological differences in the mode of gene action and the enormous sequence differences between genes with different modes of action suggest that many instances of self-incompatibility have arisen independently. In contrast, previous analyses of the S-RNase associated with gametophytic self-incompatibility in the eudicot families (Solanaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Rosaceae) have suggested that sequences within families form well-supported and distinct lineages. In this study we demonstrate that in fact, S-RNase-mediated gametophytic self-incompatibility evolved only once in the eudicots.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships among major eukaryotic protist lineages are largely uncertain. Two significant obstacles in reconstructing eukaryotic phylogeny are long-branch attraction (LBA) effects and poor taxon sampling of free-living protists. We have obtained and analyzed gene sequences encoding the largest subunit of RNA Polymerase II (RPB1) from Naegleria gruberi (a heterolobosean), Cercomonas ATCC 50319 (a cercozoan), and Ochromonas danica (a heterokont); we have also analyzed the RPB1 gene from the nucleomorph (nm) genome of Guillardia theta (a cryptomonad). Using a variety of phylogenetic methods our analysis shows that RPB1s from Giardia intestinalis and Trichomonas vaginalis are probably subject to intense LBA effects. Thus, the deep branching of these taxa on RPB1 trees is questionable and should not be interpreted as evidence favoring their early divergence. Similar effects are discernable, to a lesser extent, with the Mastigamoeba invertens RPB1 sequence. Upon removal of the outgroup and these problematic sequences, analyses of the remaining RPB1s indicate some resolution among major eukaryotic groups. The most robustly supported higher-level clades are the opisthokonts (animals plus fungi) and the red algae plus the cryptomonad nm--the latter result gives added support to the red algal origin of cryptomonad chloroplasts. Clades comprising Dictyostelium discoideum plus Acanthamoeba castellanii (Amoebozoa) and Ochromonas plus Plasmodium falciparum (chromalveolates) are consistently observed and moderately supported. The clades supported by our RPB1 analyses are congruent with other data, suggesting that bona fide phylogenetic relationships are being resolved. Thus, the RPB1 gene has apparently retained some phylogenetically meaningful signal, making it worthwhile to obtain sequences from more diverse protist taxa. Additional RPB1 data, especially in combination with other genes, should provide further resolution of branching orders among protist groups within the apparently rapid early divergence of eukaryotes.

N2  - Rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA gene order have been suggested as a tool for defining the pattern of evolutionary divergence in arthropod taxa. We have employed a combination of highly conserved insect-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers with long-PCR to survey 14 noninsect arthropods for mitochondrial gene rearrangements. The size of the amplified fragments was used to order the primer containing genes. Five chelicerates exhibit amplicons that are consistent with the presumptive ancestral arthropod mtDNA gene order. These five species comprise two soft ticks, two prostriate hard ticks, and an opilionid. Six other chelicerates, all metastriate hard ticks, have a different arrangement that was originally discovered by this procedure and has been previously detailed in a complete mtDNA sequence. Three new arthropod mtDNA gene arrangements are described here. They were discovered in a terrestrial crustacean (Isopoda) and two myriapods (Chilopoda, centipede; Diplopoda, millipede). These rearrangements include major realignments of some of the large coding regions and two possible new positions for the tRNAMet (M) gene in arthropods. The long-PCR approach affords an opportunity to quickly screen divergent taxa for major rearrangements. Taxa exhibiting rearrangements can be targeted for DNA sequencing of gene boundaries to establish the details of the mtDNA organization.

N2  - Cyanobacterial tRNALeu (UAA) intron sequences from natural populations of Nostoc and other cyanobacteria were compared. Variation between the different introns was not randomly distributed but strongly restricted by the secondary and tertiary structure of the intron.  Although all Nostoc sequences examined shared high similarity, differences were observed in one stem-loop. This stem-loop could be divided into two classes, both built up from two base pairing heptanucleotide repeats. Size variation was primarily caused by different numbers of repeats, but some strains also contained additional sequences in this stem-loop not following the heptanucleotide repeat motif. Several sequences showing similarity with these additional sequences were identified in the Nostoc punctiforme genome. Furthermore, the regions flanking these sequences contained the same, or similar, heptanucleotide repeats as those flanking the corresponding sequences in the intron. It is proposed that both slipped strand mispairing during replication and homologous recombination among different loci in the genome are important processes causing variation between introns.

N2  - Antimicrobial peptides are expressed in the skin of amphibians and are used to prevent infection by microorganisms. Frog species store distinct collections of antimicrobial peptides that show variation in size, charge, conformation, and bactericidal activity, and so the evolution of antimicrobial peptide gene families may reflect the adaptive diversification of these loci. We examined the molecular evolution of antimicrobial peptide transcripts from hylid and ranid frog species. Our results show that after the gene family arose in the common ancestor of the Hylidae and Ranidae, before the divergence of these families in the Mesozoic, it subsequently diversified within these groups with numerous duplication events and divergence of loci. Moreover, we provide evidence that suggests that members of the antimicrobial peptide gene family have been subject to diversifying selection within both propiece and mature domains of hylids and solely within the mature domain of ranids. Finally, our results suggest that coordinated and compensatory amino acid replacements have occurred within the acidic propiece and cationic mature domain of hylid antimicrobial peptide precursors, as has been observed for mammalian defensin genes, but not among those of ranid precursors.

N2  - We estimated a novel phylogeny of tilapiine cichlid fish (an assemblage endemic to Africa and the Near East) within the African cichlid fishes on the basis of complete mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 (ND2) gene sequences. The ND2 (1,047 bp) gene was sequenced in 39 tilapiine cichlids (38 species and 1 subspecies) and in an additional 14 nontilapiine cichlid species in order to evaluate the traditional morphologically based hypothesis of the respective monophyly of the tilapiine and haplochromine cichlid fish assemblages. The analyses included many additional cichlid lineages, not only the so-called tilapiines, but also lineages from Lake Tanganyika, east Africa, the Neotropics and an out-group from Madagascar with a wide range of parental care and mating systems. Our results suggest, in contrast to the historical morphology-based hypotheses from Regan (1920 , 1922 ), Trewavas (1983) , and Stiassny (1991) , that the tilapiines do not form a monophyletic group because there is strong evidence that the genus Tilapia is not monophyletic but divided into at least five distinct groups. In contrast to this finding, an allozyme analysis of Pouyaud and Agnese (1995) , largely based on the same samples as used here, found a clustering of the Tilapia species into only two groups. This discrepancy is likely caused by the difference in resolution power of the two marker systems used. Our data suggest that only type species Tilapia sparrmanii Smith (1840) should retain the genus name Tilapia. One particular group of tilapiines (composed of genera Sarotherodon, Oreochromis, Iranocichla, and Tristramella) is more closely related to an evolutionarily highly successful lineage, the haplochromine cichlids that compose the adaptive radiations of cichlid species flocks of east Africa. It appears that the highly adaptable biology of tilapiines is the ancestral state for all African cichlids and that the more stenotypic lifestyle of the haplochromine cichlids is derived from this condition. We reconstructed the evolution of the highly variable parental care systems on the basis of the most inclusive composite phylogeny to date of the African, Neotropical, and Madagascan cichlids with special emphasis on a group of tilapiines comprising the substrate-spawning genus Tilapia, and the mouthbrooding genera Sarotherodon and Oreochromis. We demonstrate several independent origins of derived mouthbrooding behaviors in the family Cichlidae.

N2  - Mammalian transposable elements have intrinsic regulatory elements that can activate neighboring genes, and it is speculated that they can also carry extrinsic transactivating DNA sequences to new genomic locations. We have identified a polymorphic segment of the human interferon-γ promoter region where two adjacent binding sites for NF-κB and NFAT originated from the insertion of an Alu element approximately 22-34 MYA. Both binding sites lie outside the Alu consensus sequence but within the boundaries of the insertion, suggesting that this segment of DNA was comobilized when the Alu element moved from another part of the genome. Sequence comparisons and examination of DNA-protein interactions across nine different primate species indicate that the inserted sequence contained the intact NFAT binding site, whereas the ability to bind NF-κB evolved through a series of mutations after the insertion. These observations are consistent with the notion that retropseudogenes can comobilize intact regulatory sequences to new locations and thereby influence the evolution of gene regulatory networks; however, the extent to which such events have shaped the evolution of gene regulation remains unknown.

N2  - A test of the hypothesis that the members of the order Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) possess a slowed rate of molecular evolution was carried out by conducting relative-rate comparisons with representatives of four groups of teleost fishes (Cypriniformes, Elopomorpha, Salmonidae, and Percomorpha) using 21 nuclear or mitochondrial protein loci and the nuclear and mitochondrial small subunit rRNA genes, obtained from the literature or our own research. In 70 out of 81 comparisons between individual taxa (86%), acipenseriform sequences showed slower rates of change than the homologous teleost loci examined. When teleost sequences are considered together, 21 of the 23 loci show slower rates of substitution in the acipenseriform lineage. Teleost proteins show 1.85 times as many unique amino acid differences as acipenseriform proteins, when both are compared with outlier sequences. These results support a hypothesis of slowed molecular evolutionary rate in the Acipenseriformes.

N2  - Theory predicts that selection should be less effective in the nonrecombining genes of Y-chromosomes, relative to the situation for genes on the other chromosomes, and this should lead to the accumulation of deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions. In addition, synonymous substitution rates may differ between X- and Y-linked genes because of the male-driven evolution effect and also because of actual differences in per-replication mutation rates between the sex chromosomes. Here, we report the first study of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates on plant sex chromosomes. We sequenced two pairs of sex-linked genes, SlX1-SlY1 and SlX4-SlY4, from dioecious Silene latifolia and S. dioica, and their non-sex-linked homologues from nondioecious S. vulgaris and Lychnis flos-jovis, respectively. The rate of nonsynonymous substitutions in the SlY4 gene is significantly higher than that in the SlX4 gene. Silent substitution rates are also significantly higher in both Y-linked genes, compared with their X-linked homologues. The higher nonsynonymous substitution rate in the SlY4 gene is therefore likely to be caused by a mutation rate difference between the sex chromosomes. The difference in silent substitution rates between the SlX4 and SlY4 genes is too great to be explained solely by a higher per-generation mutation rate in males than females. It is thus probably caused by a difference in per-replication mutation rates between the sex chromosomes. This suggests that the local mutation rate can change in a relatively short evolutionary time.

N2  - The nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) to synonymous (silent) substitution rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) provides a measure of natural selection at the protein level, with ω = 1, >1, and <1, indicating neutral evolution, purifying selection, and positive selection, respectively. Previous studies that used this measure to detect positive selection have often taken an approach of pairwise comparison, estimating substitution rates by averaging over all sites in the protein. As most amino acids in a functional protein are under structural and functional constraints and adaptive evolution probably affects only a few sites at a few time points, this approach of averaging rates over sites and over time has little power. Previously, we developed codon-based substitution models that allow the ω ratio to vary either among lineages or among sites. In this paper we extend previous models to allow the ω ratio to vary both among sites and among lineages and implement the new models in the likelihood framework. These models may be useful for identifying positive selection along prespecified lineages that affects only a few sites in the protein. We apply those branch-site models as well as previous branch- and site-specific models to three data sets: the lysozyme genes from primates, the tumor suppressor BRCA1 genes from primates, and the phytochrome (PHY) gene family in angiosperms. Positive selection is detected in the lysozyme and BRCA genes by both the new and the old models. However, only the new models detected positive selection acting on lineages after gene duplication in the PHY gene family. Additional tests on several data sets suggest that the new models may be useful in detecting positive selection after gene duplication in gene family evolution.

N2  - The recent sequencing of several eukaryotic genomes has generated considerable interest in the study of gene duplication events. The classical model of duplicate gene evolution is that recurrent mutation ultimately results in one copy becoming a pseudogene, and only rarely will a beneficial new function evolve. Here, we study divergence between coding sequence duplications in Drosophila melanogaster as a function of the linkage relationship between paralogs. The mean Ka/Ks between all duplicates in the D. melanogaster genome is 0.2803, indicating that purifying selection is maintaining the structure of duplicate coding sequences. However, the mean Ka/Ks between duplicates that are both on the X chromosome is 0.4701, significantly higher than the genome average. Further, the distribution of Ka/Ks for these X-linked duplicates is significantly shifted toward higher values when compared with the distributions for paralogs in other linkage relationships. Two models of molecular evolution provide qualitative explanations of these observations--relaxation of selective pressure on the duplicate copies and, more likely, positive selection on recessive adaptations. We also show that there is an excess of X-linked duplicates with low Ks, suggesting a larger proportion of relatively young duplicates on the D. melanogaster X chromosome relative to autosomes.

N2  - The abundance and distribution of transposable elements (TEs) in a representative part of the euchromatic genome of Drosophila melanogaster were studied by analyzing the sizes and locations of TEs of all known families in the genomic sequences of chromosomes 2R, X, and 4. TEs contribute to up to 2% of the sequenced DNA, which corresponds roughly to the euchromatin of these chromosomes. This estimate is lower than that previously available from in situ data and suggests that TEs accumulate in the heterochromatin more intensively than was previously thought. We have also found that TEs are not distributed at random in the chromosomes and that their abundance is more strongly associated with local recombination rates, rather than with gene density. The results are compatible with the ectopic exchange model, which proposes that selection against deleterious effects of chromosomal rearrangements is a major force opposing element spread in the genome of this species. Selection against insertional mutations also influences the observed patterns, such as an absence of insertions in coding regions. The results of the analyses are discussed in the light of recent findings on the distribution of TEs in other species.

N2  - Although there is substantial evidence that, in animals, male-inherited neutral DNA evolves at a higher rate than female-inherited DNA, the relative evolutionary rate of male- versus female-inherited DNA has not been investigated in plants. We compared the substitution rates at neutral sites of maternally and paternally inherited organellar DNA in gymnosperms. The analysis provided substantial support for the presence of a higher evolutionary rate in both the mitochondrial and chloroplastidial DNA when the organelle was inherited paternally than when inherited maternally. These results suggest that, compared with eggs, sperm tend to carry a greater number of mutations in mitochondrial and chloroplastidial DNA. The existence of a male mutation bias in plants is remarkable because, unlike animals, the germ-lines are not separated from the somatic cells throughout an individual's lifetime. The data therefore suggest that even a brief period of male and female germ-line separation can cause gender-specific mutation rates. These results are the first to show that, at least in some species, germ-lines influence the number of mutations carried in the gametes. Possible causes of male mutation bias in plants are discussed.

N2  - Bayes prediction quantifies uncertainty by assigning posterior probabilities. It was used to identify amino acids in a protein under recurrent diversifying selection indicated by higher nonsynonymous (dN) than synonymous (dS) substitution rates or by ω = dN/dS > 1. Parameters were estimated by maximum likelihood under a codon substitution model that assumed several classes of sites with different ω ratios. The Bayes theorem was used to calculate the posterior probabilities of each site falling into these site classes. Here, we evaluate the performance of Bayes prediction of amino acids under positive selection by computer simulation. We measured the accuracy by the proportion of predicted sites that were truly under selection and the power by the proportion of true positively selected sites that were predicted by the method. The accuracy was slightly better for longer sequences, whereas the power was largely unaffected by the increase in sequence length. Both accuracy and power were higher for medium or highly diverged sequences than for similar sequences. We found that accuracy and power were unacceptably low when data contained only a few highly similar sequences. However, sampling a large number of lineages improved the performance substantially. Even for very similar sequences, accuracy and power can be high if over 100 taxa are used in the analysis. We make the following recommendations: (1) prediction of positive selection sites is not feasible for a few closely related sequences; (2) using a large number of lineages is the best way to improve the accuracy and power of the prediction; and (3) multiple models of heterogeneous selective pressures among sites should be applied in real data analysis.

N2  - The bicoid (bcd) gene of Drosophila has played an important role in understanding the system of developmental regulatory genes that controls segmentation in the fruit fly. Several studies in Drosophila and closely related insects suggest that bcd may be the result of a gene duplication in the Dipteran lineage. In addition, the presence of a large, conserved secondary structure in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) makes the bcd gene a good candidate for studying compensatory evolution and the relationship between RNA secondary structure and patterns of standing variation in natural populations. Despite these interesting aspects, a population-level analysis has until now not been performed on bcd. In this study, DNA sequence variation was examined for a 4-kb region of the bcd gene, including a portion of the 5' UTR, the entire coding region, and the 3' UTR, for 25 Drosophila melanogaster isofemale lines from Zimbabwe and one allele from D. simulans. Statistical tests revealed a significant excess of replacement polymorphisms in the D. melanogaster lineage that are clustered in two putative linker regions of the Bicoid protein. This result is consistent with a relaxation of selective constraints in these regions. In addition, we found a distinct haplotype structure and a significantly smaller number of haplotypes than predicted by the standard neutral model. It is unlikely that the haplotype structure is maintained by epistatic selection acting on the secondary structure in the 3' UTR or by the association of the bcd gene with polymorphic inversions. Instead, our two main observations, namely the occurrence of a haplotype structure and the excess of replacement polymorphisms, may indicate that the selective history of this gene is rather complex, involving both the relaxation of purifying selection in some parts of the protein and the action of positive selection in other parts of the gene region.

N2  - Most of the well-characterized mitochondrial genomes from diverse green algal lineages are circular mapping DNA molecules; however, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has a linear 15.8 kb unit mitochondrial genome with 580 or 581 bp inverted repeat ends. In mitochondrial-enriched fractions prepared from Polytomella parva (=P. agilis), a colorless, naturally wall-less relative of C. reinhardtii, we have detected two linear mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) components with sizes of 13.5 and 3.5 kb. Sequences spanning 97% and 86% of the 13.5- and 3.5-kb mtDNAs, respectively, reveal that these molecules contain long, at least 1.3 kb, homologous inverted repeat sequences at their termini. The 3.5-kb mtDNA has only one coding region (nad6), the functionality of which is supported by both the relative rate at which it has accumulated nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions and its absence from the 13.5-kb mtDNA which encodes nine genes (i.e., large and small subunit rRNA [LSU and SSU rRNA] genes, one tRNA gene, and six protein-coding genes). On the basis of DNA sequence data, we propose that a variant start codon, GTG, is utilized by the P. parva 13.5-kb mtDNA-encoded gene, nad5. Using the relative rate test with Chlamydomonas moewusii (=C. eugametos) as the outgroup, we conclude that the nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution rate in the mitochondrial protein-coding genes of P. parva is on an average about 3.3 times that of the C. reinhardtii counterparts.

N2  - British history contains several periods of major cultural change. It remains controversial as to how much these periods coincided with substantial immigration from continental Europe, even for those that occurred most recently. In this study, we examine genetic data for evidence of male immigration at particular times into Central England and North Wales. To do this, we used 12 biallelic polymorphisms and six microsatellite markers to define high-resolution Y chromosome haplotypes in a sample of 313 males from seven towns located along an east-west transect from East Anglia to North Wales. The Central English towns were genetically very similar, whereas the two North Welsh towns differed significantly both from each other and from the Central English towns. When we compared our data with an additional 177 samples collected in Friesland and Norway, we found that the Central English and Frisian samples were statistically indistinguishable. Using novel population genetic models that incorporate both mass migration and continuous gene flow, we conclude that these striking patterns are best explained by a substantial migration of Anglo-Saxon Y chromosomes into Central England (contributing 50%-100% to the gene pool at that time) but not into North Wales.

N2  - The ratio of radical to conservative amino acid replacements is frequently used to infer positive Darwinian selection. This method is based on the assumption that radical replacements are more likely than conservative replacements to improve the function of a protein. Therefore, if positive selection plays a major role in the evolution of a protein, one would expect the radical-conservative ratio to exceed the expectation under neutrality. Here, we investigate the possibility that factors unrelated to selection, i.e., transition-transversion ratio, codon usage, genetic code, and amino acid composition, influence the radical-conservative replacement ratio. All factors that have been studied were found to affect the radical-conservative replacement ratio. In particular, amino acid composition and transition-transversion ratio are shown to have the most profound effects. Because none of the studied factors had anything to do with selection (positive or otherwise) and also because all of them (singly or in combination) affected a measure that was supposed to be indicative of positive selection, we conclude that selectional inferences based on radical-conservative replacement ratios should be treated with suspicion.

N2  - The nucleotide sequences of the Adh and Adhr genes of Drosophila kuntzei were derived from combined overlapping sequences of clones isolated from a genomic library and from cloned PCR and inverse-PCR fragments. Only a proximal promoter was detected upstream of the Adh gene, indicating that D. kuntzei Adh is regulated by a one-promoter system. Further upstream of the Adh structural gene, an adult enhancer region (AAE) was found that contains most of the regulatory sequences described for AAEs of other Drosophila species. Analysis of the ADH protein showed an amino acid change from valine to threonine in the active site at position 189 which is also found in D. funebris but is otherwise unique among Drosophila. This difference alone may be responsible for the very low ADH activity found in this species and may cause a difference in substrate usage pattern. Codon bias in Adh and Adhr was comparable and found to be very low compared with other species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that D. kuntzei is closest related to D. funebris and D. immigrans. The time of divergence between D. kuntzei and D. funebris was estimated to be 14.2-20.2 Myr and that between D. kuntzei-D. funebris and D. immigrans to be 30.8-44.0 Myr. An analysis of the genetic variation in the Adh gene and upstream sequences of four European strains showed that this gene was highly variable. Overall nucleotide diversity (π) was 0.0139, which is two times higher than that in D. melanogaster.

N2  - Myosins constitute a superfamily of motor proteins that convert energy from ATP hydrolysis into mechanical movement along the actin filaments. Phylogenetic analysis currently places myosins into 17 classes based on class-specific features of their conserved motor domain. Traditionally, the myosins have been divided into two classes depending on whether they form monomers or dimers. The conventional myosin of muscle and nonmuscle cells forms class II myosins. They are complex molecules of four light chains bound to two heavy chains that form bipolar filaments via interactions between their coiled-coil tails (type II). Class I myosins are smaller monomeric myosins referred to as unconventional myosins. Now, at least 15 other classes of unconventional myosins are known.  How many myosins are needed to ensure the proper development and function of eukaryotic organisms? Thus far, three types of myosins were found in budding yeast, six in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, and at least 12 in human. Here, we report on the identification and classification of Drosophila melanogaster myosins. Analysis of the Drosophila genome sequence identified 13 myosin genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequence comparison of the myosin motor domains, as well as the presence of the class-specific domains, suggests that Drosophila myosins can be divided into nine major classes. Myosins belonging to previously described classes I, II, III, V, VI, and VII are present. Molecular and phylogenetic analysis indicates that the fruitfly genome contains at least five new myosins. Three of them fall into previously described myosin classes I, VII, and XV. Another myosin is a homolog of the mouse and human PDZ-containing myosins, forming the recently defined class XVIII myosins. PDZ domains are named after the postsynaptic density, disc-large, ZO-1 proteins in which they were first described. The fifth myosin shows a unique domain composition and a low homology to any of the existing classes. We propose that this is classified when similar myosins are identified in other species.

N2  - Rodentia is the largest order of placental mammals, with approximately 2,050 species divided into 28 families. It is also one of the most controversial with respect to its monophyly, relationships between families, and divergence dates. Here, we have analyzed and compared the performance of three nuclear genes (von Willebrand Factor, interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein, and Alpha 2B adrenergic receptor) for a large taxonomic sampling, covering the whole rodent and placental diversity. The phylogenetic results significantly support rodent monophyly, the association of Rodentia with Lagomorpha (the Glires clade), and a Glires + Euarchonta (Primates, Dermoptera, and Scandentia) clade. The resolution of relationships among rodents is also greatly improved. The currently recognized families are divided here into seven well-defined clades (Anomaluromorpha, Castoridae, Ctenohystrica, Geomyoidea, Gliridae, Myodonta, and Sciuroidea) that can be grouped into three major clades: Ctenohystrica, Gliridae + Sciuroidea, and a mouse-related clade (Anomaluromorpha, Castoridae + Geomyoidea, and Myodonta). Molecular datings based on these three genes suggest that the rodent radiation took place at the transition between Paleocene and Eocene. The divergence between rodents and lagomorphs is placed just at the K-T boundary and the first splits among placentals in the Late Cretaceous. Our results thus tend to reconcile molecular and morphological-paleontological insights.

N2  - The ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) gene family has been widely studied in animals and is determined to be important in excitatory neurotransmission and other neuronal processes. We have previously identified ionotropic glutamate receptor-like genes (GLRs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, an organism that lacks a nervous system. Upon the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequencing project, a large family of GLR genes has been uncovered. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis divides the AtGLR gene family into three clades and is used as the basis for the recently established nomenclature for the AtGLR gene family. We performed a phylogenetic analysis with extensive annotations of the iGluR gene family, which includes all 20 Arabidopsis GLR genes, the entire iGluR family from rat (except NR3), and two prokaryotic iGluRs, Synechocystis GluR0 and Anabaena GluR. Our analysis supports the division of the AtGLR gene family into three clades and identifies potential functionally important amino acid residues that are conserved in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic iGluRs as well as those that are only conserved in AtGLRs. To begin to investigate whether the three AtGLR clades represent different functional classes, we performed the first comprehensive mRNA expression analysis of the entire AtGLR gene family. On the basis of RT-PCR, all AtGLRs are expressed genes. The three AtGLR clades do not show distinct clade-specific organ expression patterns. All 20 AtGLR genes are expressed in the root. Among them, five of the nine clade-II genes are root-specific in 8-week-old Arabidopsis plants.

N2  - Primate growth hormone (GH) has evolved rapidly, having undergone ~30% amino acid substitutions from the inferred ancestral eutherian sequence. Nevertheless, human growth hormone (hGH) is physiologically effective when administered to nonprimate mammals. In contrast, its functional counterpart, the human growth hormone receptor (hGHR), has evolved species specificity so that it responds only to Old World primate GHs. It has been proposed that this species specificity of the hGHR is largely caused by the Leu → Arg change at position 43 after a prior His → Asp change at position 171 of the GH. Sequence analyses supported this hypothesis and revealed that the transitional phase in the GH:GHR coevolution still persists in New World monkeys. For example, although the GH of the squirrel monkey has the His → Asp substitution at position 171, residue 43 of its GHR is a Leu, the nonprimate residue. If the squirrel monkey truly represents an intermediate stage of GH:GHR coevolution, its GHR should respond to both hGH and nonprimate GH. Also, if the emergence of species specificity was a result of the selection for a more efficient GH:GHR interaction, then changing residue 43 of the squirrel monkey growth hormone receptor (smGHR) to Arg should increase its binding affinity toward higher primate GH. To test these hypotheses, we performed protein-binding assays between the smGHR and both human and rat GHs, using the surface plasmon resonance methodology. Furthermore, the effects of reciprocal mutations at position 43 of human and squirrel monkey GHRs are measured for their binding affinities toward human and squirrel monkey GHs. The results from the binding kinetic assays clearly demonstrate that the smGHR is in the intermediate state of the evolution of species specificity. Interestingly, the altered residue Arg at position 43 of the smGHR does not lead to an increased binding affinity. The implications of these results on the evolution of the GH:GHR interaction and on functional evolution are discussed.

N2  - IgA is a major component that prevents the penetration of pathogenic bacteria into mucosal surfaces. The IgA antibody is cleaved at the IgA hinge region with high specificity by IgA-specific proteases produced by several pathogenic bacteria. We conducted a genomic sequence analysis of the IgA genes of a wide spectrum of primates, including the first intron and second exon, which consist of the hinge region and the CH2 domain, to find evidence of positive selection. Because the hinge region is quite small, we combined the largest collection of sequences that could be clearly aligned and evaluated the total numbers of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions on the phylogenetic tree. The nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratio (dN/dS test) showed that hominoids, Old World monkeys, and New World monkeys have dN/dS ratios of 5.4, 6.3, and 4.2, respectively. Fisher's exact probability tests showed statistical significance for the Old World monkey. Because the substitution rates of the flanking sequences are more or less similar to the synonymous rates of the hinge region, these high values of dN/dS should be the result of positive selection at the hinge region. Combining the high sequence variability in each population and the highly accelerated nonsynonymous substitution rates in the hinge region, we conclude that this unusual IgA evolution is a molecular evidence of adaptive evolution possibly caused by the host-parasite relationship.

N2  - We investigated the putative association between the parasitic lifestyle and an accelerated rate of mt genetic divergence, compositional bias, and gene rearrangement, employing a range of parasitic and nonparasitic Diptera and Hymenoptera. Sequences were obtained for the cox1, cox2, 16S, 28S genes, the regions between the cox2 and atp8 genes, and between the nad3 and nad5 genes. Relative rate tests indicated generally that the parasitic lifestyle was not associated with an increased rate of genetic divergence in the Diptera but reaffirmed that it was in the Hymenoptera. Similarly, a departure from compositional stationarity was not associated with parasitic Diptera but was in parasitic Hymenoptera. Finally, mitochondrial (mt) gene rearrangements were not observed in any of the dipteran species examined. The results indicate that these genetic phenomena are not accelerated in parasitic Diptera compared with nonparasitic Diptera. A possible explanation for the differences in the rate of mt molecular evolution in parasitic Diptera and Hymenoptera is the extraordinary level of radiation that has occurred within the parasitic Hymenoptera but not in any of the dipteran parasitic lineages. If speciation events in the parasitic Hymenoptera are associated with founder events, a faster rate of molecular evolution is expected. Alternatively, biological differences between endoparasitic Hymenoptera and endoparasitic Diptera may also account for the differences observed in molecular evolution.

N2  - Comparisons between human and rodent DNA sequences are widely used for the identification of regulatory regions (phylogenetic footprinting), and the importance of such intergenomic comparisons for promoter annotation is expanding. The efficacy of such comparisons for the identification of functional regulatory elements hinges on the evolutionary dynamics of promoter sequences. Although it is widely appreciated that conservation of sequence motifs may provide a suggestion of function, it is not known as to what proportion of the functional binding sites in humans is conserved in distant species. In this report, we present an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of transcription factor binding sites whose function had been experimentally verified in promoters of 51 human genes and compare their sequence to homologous sequences in other primate species and rodents. Our results show that there is extensive divergence within the nucleotide sequence of transcription factor binding sites. Using direct experimental data from functional studies in both human and rodents for 20 of the regulatory regions, we estimate that 32%-40% of the human functional sites are not functional in rodents. This is evidence that there is widespread turnover of transcription factor binding sites. These results have important implications for the efficacy of phylogenetic footprinting and the interpretation of the pattern of evolution in regulatory sequences.

N2  - Awadalla, Eyre-Walker, and Maynard Smith (1999) recently argued that there might be recombination in human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Their claim was based on their observation of decaying linkage disequilibrium (LD) as a function of physical distance. Their study was much criticized, and follow-up studies have failed to find any evidence for recombination. We argue that the criticisms levied, even if correct, could not possibly explain the findings of Awadalla, Eyre-Walker, and Maynard Smith (1999) . Nonetheless, the test proposed by Awadalla, Eyre-Walker, and Maynard Smith (1999 ) is not robust because recombination is not the only explanation for decay of LD. We show that such a pattern can be caused by mutational hot spots as well. However, a closer look at the data suggests that the pattern observed was not caused by mutational hot spots but rather by chance. Thus, there appears to be no evidence for recombination in the mtDNA polymorphism data. In conclusion, we discuss the possibility of detecting recombination in mtDNA and the implications of its existence.

N2  - Malaria parasites invade erythrocytes in a process mediated by a series of molecular interactions. Invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium vivax is dependent upon the presence of a single receptor, but P. falciparum, as well as some other species, exhibits the ability to utilize multiple alternative invasion pathways. Conserved cysteine-rich domains play important roles at critical times during this invasion process and at other stages in the life cycle of malaria parasites. Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domains, expressed as a part of the erythrocyte-binding proteins (DBL-EBP), are such essential cysteine-rich ligands that recognize specific host cell surface receptors. DBL-EBP, which are products of the erythrocyte-binding-like (ebl) gene family, act as critical determinants of erythrocyte specificity and are the best-defined ligands from invasive stages of malaria parasites. The ebl genes include the P. falciparum erythrocyte-binding antigen-175 (EBA-175) and P. vivax Duffy-binding protein. DBL domains also mediate cytoadherence as a part of the variant erythrocytic membrane protein-1 (PfEMP-1) antigens expressed from var genes on the surface of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. A paralogue of the ebl family is the malarial ligand MAEBL, which has a chimeric structure where the DBL domain is functionally replaced with a distinct cysteine-rich erythrocyte-binding domain with similarity to the apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) ligand domain. The Plasmodium AMA-1 ligand domain, which encompasses the extracellular cysteine domains 1 and 2 and is well conserved in a Toxoplasma gondii AMA-1, has erythrocyte-binding activity distinct from that of MAEBL. These important families of Plasmodium molecules (DBL-EBP, PfEMP-1, MAEBL, AMA-1) are interrelated through the MAEBL. Because MAEBL and the other ebl products have the characteristics expected of homologous ligands involved in equivalent alternative invasion pathways to each other, we sought to better understand their roles during invasion by determining their relative origins in the Plasmodium genome. An analysis of their multiple cysteine-rich domains permitted a unique insight into the evolutionary development of Plasmodium. Our data indicate that maebl, ama-1, and ebl genes have ancient origins which predate Plasmodium speciation. The maebl evolved as a single locus, including its unique chimeric structure, in each Plasmodium species, in parallel with the ama-1 and the ebl genes families. The ancient character of maebl, along with its different expression characteristics suggests that MAEBL is unique and does not play an alternative role in invasion to ebl products such as EBA-175. The multiple P. falciparum ebl paralogues that express DBL domains, which have occurred by duplication and diversification, potentially do provide multiple functionally equivalent ligands to EBA-175 for alternative invasion pathways.

N2  - Both natural selection and nonequilibrium population-level processes can lead to a skew in the frequency distribution of polymorphisms. Population-level processes are expected to affect all loci in a roughly equal fashion, whereas selection will affect only some regions of the genome. We conducted a sliding-window analysis of the frequency distribution of microsatellite polymorphisms across the human genome to identify regions that may be under positive selection. The analysis was based on a published data set of 5,257 mapped microsatellites in individuals of European ancestry. Observed and expected numbers of alleles were compared under a stepwise mutation model (SMM) using analytical formulae. Observed and expected heterozygosities were compared under a SMM using coalescent simulations. The two sets of analyses gave similar results. Approximately one-fourth of all loci showed a significant deficit of heterozygosity, consistent with a recent population expansion. Forty-three windows were identified with extreme skews in the frequency distribution of polymorphisms (in the direction of a deficit of heterozygosity, given the number of alleles). If these extreme windows are tracking selection at linked sites, theory predicts that they should be more common in regions of the genome with less recombination. We tested this prediction by comparing recombination rates in these extreme windows and in other regions of the genome and found that extreme windows had a significantly lower recombination rate than the genomic average. The proportion of extreme windows was significantly higher on the X chromosome than on the autosomes. Moreover, all the windows with extreme skews on the X chromosome were found in two clusters near the centromere; both these clusters exhibit markedly reduced recombination rates. These analyses point to regions of the genome that may recently have been subject to positive selection. These results also suggest that the effects of positive selection may be more pronounced on the X chromosome than on the autosomes in humans.

N2  - Genome size varies considerably between species, and transposable elements (TEs) are known to play an important role in this variability. However, it is far from clear whether TEs are involved in genome size differences between populations within a given species. We show here that in Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans the size of the genome varies among populations and is correlated with the TE copy number on the chromosome arms. The TEs embedded within the heterochromatin do not seem to be involved directly in this phenomenon, although they may contribute to differences in genome size. Furthermore, genome size and TE content variations parallel the worldwide colonization of D. melanogaster species. No such relationship exists for the more recently dispersed D. simulans species, which indicates that a quantitative increase in the TEs in local populations and fly migration are sufficient to account for the increase in genome size, with no need for an adaptation hypothesis.

N2  - The heat-shock protein GroEL is a double-ring-structured chaperonin that assists the folding of many newly synthesized proteins in Escherichia coli and the refolding in vitro, with the cochaperonin GroES, of conformationally damaged proteins. This protein is constitutively overexpressed in the primary symbiotic bacteria of many insects, constituting approximately 10% of the total protein in Buchnera, the primary endosymbiont of aphids. In the present study, we perform a maximum likelihood (ML) analysis to unveil the selective constraints in GroEL. In addition, we apply a new statistical approach to determine the patterns of evolution in this highly interesting protein. The main conclusion derived from our analysis is that GroEL has suffered an accelerated rate of amino acid substitution upon the symbiotic integration of Buchnera into the aphids. It is most interesting that the ML analysis of codon substitutions in the different branches of the phylogenetic tree strongly supports the action of positive selection in the different lineages of Buchnera. Additionally, the new sliding window analysis of the complete groEL sequence reveals different regions of the molecule under the action of positive selection, mainly located in the apical domain, that are important for both peptide and GroES binding.

N2  - Bayesian inference is becoming a common statistical approach to phylogenetic estimation because, among other reasons, it allows for rapid analysis of large data sets with complex evolutionary models. Conveniently, Bayesian phylogenetic methods use currently available stochastic models of sequence evolution. However, as with other model-based approaches, the results of Bayesian inference are conditional on the assumed model of evolution: inadequate models (models that poorly fit the data) may result in erroneous inferences. In this article, I present a Bayesian phylogenetic method that evaluates the adequacy of evolutionary models using posterior predictive distributions. By evaluating a model's posterior predictive performance, an adequate model can be selected for a Bayesian phylogenetic study. Although I present a single test statistic that assesses the overall (global) performance of a phylogenetic model, a variety of test statistics can be tailored to evaluate specific features (local performance) of evolutionary models to identify sources failure. The method presented here, unlike the likelihood-ratio test and parametric bootstrap, accounts for uncertainty in the phylogeny and model parameters.

N2  - This study presents compelling evidence that recombination significantly increases the silent GC content of a genome in a selectively neutral manner, resulting in a highly significant positive correlation between recombination and "GC3s" in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Neither selection nor mutation can explain this relationship. A highly significant GC-biased mismatch repair system is documented for the first time in any member of the Kingdom Fungi. Much of the variation in the GC3s within yeast appears to result from GC-biased gene conversion. Evidence suggests that GC-biased mismatch repair exists in numerous organisms spanning six kingdoms. This transkingdom GC mismatch repair bias may have evolved in response to a ubiquitous AT mutational bias. A significant positive correlation between recombination and GC content is found in many of these same organisms, suggesting that the processes influencing the evolution of the yeast genome may be a general phenomenon. Nonrecombining regions of the genome and nonrecombining genomes would not be subject to this type of molecular drive. It is suggested that the low GC content characteristic of many nonrecombining genomes may be the result of three processes (1) a prevailing AT mutational bias, (2) random fixation of the most common types of mutation, and (3) the absence of the GC-biased gene conversion which, in recombining organisms, permits the reversal of the most common types of mutation. A model is proposed to explain the observation that introns, intergenic regions, and pseudogenes typically have lower GC content than the silent sites of corresponding open reading frames. This model is based on the observation that the greater the heterology between two sequences, the less likely it is that recombination will occur between them. According to this "Constraint" hypothesis, the formation and propagation of heteroduplex DNA is expected to occur, on average, more frequently within conserved coding and regulatory regions of the genome. In organisms possessing GC-biased mismatch repair, this would enhance the GC content of these regions through biased gene conversion. These findings have a number of important implications for the way we view genome evolution and suggest a new model for the evolution of sex.

N2  - Lichens from the genus Umbilicaria were collected across a 5,000-km transect through Antarctica and investigated for DNA sequence polymorphism in a region of 480-660 bp of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA. Sequences from both fungal (16 ascomycetes) and photosynthetic partners (22 chlorophytes from the genus Trebouxia) were determined and compared with homologs from lichens inhabiting more temperate, continental climates. The phylogenetic analyses reveal that Antarctic lichens have colonized their current habitats both through multiple independent colonization events from temperate embarkation zones and through recent long-range dispersal in the Antarctic of successful preexisting colonizers. Furthermore, the results suggest that relichenization--de novo establishment of the fungus-photosynthesizer symbiosis from nonlichenized algal and fungal cells--has occurred during the process of Antarctic lichen dispersal. Independent dispersal of algal and fungal cultures therefore can lead to a successful establishment of the lichen symbiosis even under harsh Antarctic conditions.

N2  - Spartina x townsendii arose during the end of the 19th century in England by hybridization between the indigenous Spartina maritima and the introduced Spartina alterniflora, native to the eastern seaboard of North America. Duplication of the hybrid genome gave rise to Spartina anglica, a vigorous allopolyploid involved in natural and artificial invasions on several continents. This system allows investigation of the early evolutionary changes that accompany stabilization of new allopolyploid species. Because allopolyploidy may be a genomic shock, eliciting retroelement insertional activity, we examined whether retrotransposons present in the parental species have been activated in the genome of S. anglica. For this purpose we used inter-retrotransposon amplified polymorphism (IRAP) and retrotransposons-microsatellite amplified polymorphism (REMAP) markers, which are multilocus PCR-based methods detecting retrotransposon integration events in the genome. IRAP and REMAP allowed the screening of insertional polymorphisms in populations of S. anglica. The populations are composed mainly of one major multilocus genotype, identical to the first-generation hybrid S. x townsendii. Few new integration sites were encountered in the young allopolyploid genome. We also found strict additivity of the parental subgenomes in the allopolyploid. Both these findings indicate that the genome of S. anglica has not undergone extensive changes since its formation. This contrasts with previous results from the literature, which report rapid structural changes in experimentally resynthesized allopolyploids.

N2  - DNA inversions are mutations involving major rearrangements of the genome and are often regarded as either deleterious or catastrophic to gene function and can be associated with genomic disorders, such as Hunter syndrome and some forms of hemophilia. Here, we propose that DNA inversions are also an essential and hitherto unrecognized component of gene evolution in eukaryotic cells. Specifically, we provide evidence that an ancestral neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) gene was duplicated and that one copy retained its original function, whereas an internal DNA inversion occurred in the other. Crucially, the inversion resulted in the creation of new regulatory elements required for the termination and activation of transcription. In consequence, the duplicated gene was split, and two new and independently expressed genes were created. Through its dependence on DNA inversion, this is a fundamentally new scheme for gene evolution, which we show as being of particular relevance to the generation of endogenous antisense-containing RNA molecules. Functionally, such transcripts can operate as natural negative regulators of the expression of the genes to which they are related through a common ancestor.

N2  - It has been suggested that Rickettsia Palindromic Elements (RPEs) have evolved as selfish DNA that mediate protein sequence evolution by being targeted to genes that code for RNA and proteins. Here, we have examined the phylogenetic depth of two RPEs that are located close to the genes encoding elongation factors Tu (tuf) and G (fus) in Rickettsia. An exceptional organization of the elongation factor genes was found in all 11 species examined, with complete or partial RPEs identified downstream of the tuf gene (RPE-tuf) in six species and of the fus gene (RPE-fus) in 10 species. A phylogenetic reconstruction shows that both RPE-tuf and RPE-fus have evolved in a manner that is consistent with the expected species divergence. The analysis provides evidence for independent loss of RPE-tuf in several species, possibly mediated by short repetitive sequences flanking the site of excision. The remaining RPE-tuf sequences evolve as neutral sequences in different stages of deterioration. Likewise, highly fragmented remnants of the RPE-fus sequence were identified in two species. This suggests that genome-specific differences in the content of RPEs are the result of recent loss rather than recent proliferation.

N2  - Cave bears (Ursus spelaeus) existed in Europe and western Asia until the end of the last glaciation some 10,000 years ago. To investigate the genetic diversity, population history, and relationship among different cave bear populations, we have determined mitochondrial DNA sequences from 12 cave bears that range in age from about 26,500 to at least 49,000 years and originate from nine caves. The samples include one individual from the type specimen population, as well as two small-sized high-Alpine bears. The results show that about 49,000 years ago, the mtDNA diversity among cave bears was about 1.8-fold lower than the current species-wide diversity of brown bears (Ursus arctos). However, the current brown bear mtDNA gene pool consists of three clades, and cave bear mtDNA diversity is similar to the diversity observed within each of these clades. The results also show that geographically separated populations of the high-Alpine cave bear form were polyphyletic with respect to their mtDNA. This suggests that small size may have been an ancestral trait in cave bears and that large size evolved at least twice independently.

N2  - Microsatellites are important tools for plant breeding, genetics, and evolution, but few studies have analyzed their mutation pattern in plants. In this study, we estimated the mutation rate for 142 microsatellite loci in maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) in two different experiments of mutation accumulation. The mutation rate per generation was estimated to be 7.7 x 10-4 for microsatellites with dinucleotide repeat motifs, with a 95% confidence interval from 5.2 x 10-4 to 1.1 x 10-3. For microsatellites with repeat motifs of more than 2 bp in length, no mutations were detected; so we could only estimate the upper 95% confidence limit of 5.1 x 10-5 for the mutation rate. For dinucleotide repeat microsatellites, we also determined that the variance of change in the number of repeats (σm2) is 3.2. We sequenced 55 of the 73 observed mutations, and all mutations proved to be changes in the number of repeats in the microsatellite or in mononucleotide tracts flanking the microsatellite. There is a higher probability to mutate to an allele of larger size. There is heterogeneity in the mutation rate among dinucleotide microsatellites and a positive correlation between the number of repeats in the progenitor allele and the mutation rate. The microsatellite-based estimate of the effective population size of maize is more than an order of magnitude less than previously reported values based on nucleotide sequence variation.

N2  - FRIGIDA (FRI) is a major gene involved in the regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. Nucleotide variation at this gene was investigated by sequencing 25 field ecotypes collected from western Europe. Genetic diversity at FRI was characterized by a high number of haplotypes and an excess of low-frequency polymorphisms. A large excess of intraspecific nonsynonymous variation associated with low synonymous variation was detected along the first exon in the FRI gene. In contrast, no excess of nonsynonymous divergence was detected between A. thaliana and A. lyrata. The Tajima and McDonald and Kreitman tests, however, suggested that this gene has evolved in a nonneutral fashion. Nonsynonymous variation included eight loss-of-function mutations that have probably arisen recently and independently in several locations. A phenotypic evaluation of the sequenced ecotypes confirmed that these loss-of-function mutations were associated with an early-flowering phenotype. Taken together, our results suggest that DNA polymorphism at the FRI gene in A. thaliana from western Europe has been shaped by recent positive selection for earliness in a set of isolated populations.

N2  - Technical and biological hurdles have precluded the retrieval of nuclear gene genealogies within most species. Among these obstacles, the possibility of intragenic recombination is one of the most demanding challenges. We studied the utility of nuclear genes for intraspecific evolutionary inferences by selecting a nuclear gene that exhibits patterns of considerable geographic differentiation in the brown trout (Salmo trutta) species complex. Haplotype variation from a nucleotide sequence of ~3.7 kb encompassing a portion of the transferrin (TF) gene was surveyed in 31 brown trout individuals collected across the native Eurasian range. Statistically significant recombination and gene conversion events were detected. However, we showed that the substantial cladistic structure was not disrupted by recombination or gene conversion events and the additional structure was estimated to have emerged after those events. Because loci with unusually high levels of variation might indicate the presence of selection, we tested the hypothesis of neutrality and found some evidence for directional selection. The strong geographic signal observed in the TF genealogy, coupled with the current spatial distribution of electromorphs, gave us the ability to draw empirical phylogeographic inferences. We delineated the composition of current brown trout populations on the basis of 3,625 individuals electrophoretically scored for the TF locus. We hypothesized scenarios of historical radiation and dispersal events, thus providing new insights refining previous allozyme and mtDNA inferences. We infer that the most ancestral brown trout populations inhabited tributaries from the Black, Caspian, and Aral Sea drainages. An early radiation of the species occurred throughout the Mediterranean, followed by independent dispersal events from the Adriatic to the southernmost Iberian Atlantic and, more recently, a rapid expansion throughout most of the Atlantic drainages.

N2  - The brine shrimp Artemia has three extracellular hemoglobins (Hbs) that are developmentally expressed and exhibit distinct oxygen-binding characteristics (Heip, Moens, and Kondo 1978 ; Heip et al. 1978 ). These Hbs are composed of two polymers, each of which comprises nine covalently linked globin domains. Although the cDNA sequences of two nine-domain globins from Artemia have been published, there is evidence for the existence of further expressed globin genes (Manning, Trotman, and Tate 1990 ). In the present study extensive analysis at the cDNA and genomic levels was performed in order to determine the globin gene copy number in Artemia. Sequence and Southern analysis suggest that four Hb polymers (T1, T2, C1, and C2) are expressed in Artemia. In addition, there is also at least one globin pseudogene. Protein sequencing of the native Hbs revealed that there are limitations on which two polymers can associate. The composition of the Hbs has been determined to be: Hb I, C1C2; Hb II, C1T2; and Hb III, T1T2. These pairings allow the levels of the three Artemia Hbs to be regulated independently by polymer expression alone, therefore explaining the previously inconsistent developmental and hypoxia-induced expression patterns.

N2  - Loss of selective constraint on a gene may be expected following changes in the environment or life history that render its function unnecessary. The long-term persistence of protein-coding genes after the loss of known functional necessity can occur by chance or because of selective maintenance of an unknown gene function. The selective maintenance of an alternative gene function is not demonstrated by the failure of statistical tests to reject the hypothesis that there has been no change in the degree of constraint on the evolution of coding genes. Maintenance may be inferred, however, when power analyses of such tests demonstrate that there has been a sufficient number of nucleotide substitutions to detect the loss of selective constraint. Here, we describe a power analysis for tests of loss of constraint on protein-coding genes. The power analysis was applied to loss-of-constraint tests for opsin gene evolution in cave-dwelling crayfish and rbcL evolution in nonphotosynthetic parasitic plants. The power of previously applied tests for loss of constraint on cave crayfish opsin genes was insufficient to distinguish between chance retention and selective maintenance of opsin genes. However, the power of codon-based likelihood ratio tests for change in dN/dS (=ω) (nonsynonymous to synonymous change) did have sufficient power to detect a loss of constraint on rbcL associated with a loss of photosynthesis in most examples but failed to detect such a change in three independent lineages. We conclude that rbcL has been selectively maintained in these holoparasitic plant lineages. This conclusion suggests that either these taxa are photosynthetic for at least a part of their life or rbcL may have an unknown function in these plants unrelated to photosynthesis.

N2  - The African cichlid (AFC) family of short interspersed elements (SINEs) is found in the genomes of cichlid fish. The alignment of the sequences of 70 members of this family, isolated from such fish in Africa, revealed the presence of correlated changes in specific nucleotides (diagnostic nucleotides) that allowed us to categorize the various members into six subfamilies, which were designated Af1 through Af6. Dividing the SINE consensus sequence into a 5'-head and 3'-tail region, these subfamilies were defined by various combinations of four types of head region (A-D) and three types of tail region [X, Y, and (YX)], with each region of each type including unique diagnostic nucleotides. The observed structures of the subfamilies Af1 through Af6 were AX, AY, CY, A(YX), BY, and DX, respectively. The formation of such structures might have involved the shuffling of head or tail regions among preexisting and existing (or both) subfamilies of the AFC family (and, probably, even another SINE family or a pseudogene for a tRNA in the case of the Af6 subfamily) by recombination at the so-called core region during the course of evolution. By plotting the timing of the retroposition of individual members of each subfamily on a phylogenetic tree of AFCs, we found that the Af3 and Af6 subfamilies became active only recently in the evolutionary history of these fish. The integrity of the 3'-tails of SINEs, which are, apparently, recognized by reverse transcriptase, has been reported to be indispensable for retention of retropositional activity. Therefore, we postulate that recombination might have been involved in the apparent recent activation of the retroposition of the Af3 and Af6 subfamilies via introduction of active tails (types Y and X, respectively) into potential ancestral sequences that might have had inactive tails. If this hypothesis is correct, shuffling of tail regions among subfamilies by recombination at the core region might have played a role in the recycling of dead copies of AFC SINEs.

N2  - A family of sequences resembling Gypsy retroelements was identified and shown to be widely distributed throughout the genus Phytophthora, a member of the algallike oomycete fungi. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific and degenerate primers detected the family in 29 of 37 species tested. DNA hybridization also failed to detect the sequences in the eight species that were negative in PCR. The element appears to have been a major force in the shaping of Phytophthora genomes because its abundance varied drastically from about 10 to more than 10,000 copies per genome within the species containing the element. Family members diverged from each other by single-base changes, insertions, and deletions, with a mean nucleotide divergence of 16.7%. By constructing phylogenies of the elements, lineages were identified that predated speciation events within Phytophthora and subfamilies that had diverged more recently. The element was studied in detail in Phytophthora infestans, in which about 30 copies are dispersed throughout the genome. Phylogenetic comparisons of the reverse transcriptases placed the family within the Ty3/Gypsy group of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, with the closest affinities to elements from plants. However, each of 12 family members sequenced contained defects that would render their protein products inactive, including frameshift mutations within reverse transcriptase domains and truncations that appeared to eliminate gag, protease, and terminal repeat sequences.

N2  - Bivalves of the families Mytilidae and Unionidae show a unique mode of mitochondrial DNA inheritance called doubly uniparental inheritance. In addition to receiving the maternally transmitted mtDNA lineage, males receive a separate mtDNA genome from their fathers. This system is sometimes compromised, in that female genomes are occasionally recruited into the male cycle of inheritance. These masculinization events are common in the Mytilidae but have not been reported in the Unionidae. In order to estimate the age of the male and the female lineages in the Unionidae and to look for evidence of masculinization, we sequenced the junction between the cytochrome c oxidase II gene and the cytochrome c oxidase I gene. The unionid male and female lineages diverged ~450 MYA. There is no evidence for masculinization during this period, suggesting that there are taxon-specific differences in the rate of masculinization. Coincidentally, a 200-codon extension of the COII gene is present in the male genome of the Unionidae and may be responsible for the absence of masculinization.

N2  - A large number of repeats of a satellite DNA (stDNA) family have been cloned and sequenced from species and populations of the genus Pimelia (Tenebrionidae, Coleoptera). The beetles were collected in the Canary Islands, Morocco, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Balearic Islands in order to analyze the evolutionary forces and processes acting on abundant stDNAs conserved at the genus level. This repetitive family is composed of an abundant A-T-rich stDNA, with basic units of 357 bp. All the sequences obtained showed similarity to the 22 repeat units of the PIM357 stDNA family described previously for six Iberian Pimelia species (Pons et al. 1997 ). An analysis based on similarity shows the presence of three different groups of sequences clearly in accordance with their geographical origin. One is composed of satellite sequences from Iberian and Balearic species, a second group from the Moroccan taxa, whereas the third one is from the Pimelia species endemic to the Canary Islands. The latter group shows higher nucleotide diversities for their stDNA sequences and a lack of relationship between transition stages to fixation and sequence divergence. Phylogeographic data of Canarian Pimelia show that the PIM357 stDNA family has persisted for more than 8 Myr and could probably be traced to the origin of the lineage. The data suggest that distinct demographic and phylogenetic patterns related to the colonization of the volcanic Canarian island chain account for particular evolutionary dynamics of the repeat DNA family in this group.

N2  - The Rickettsiaceae is a family of intracellular bacterial symbionts that includes both vertically transmitted parasites that spread by manipulating the reproduction of their host (Wolbachia in arthropods) and horizontally transmitted parasites (represented by Cowdria ruminantium), and mutualists (Wolbachia pipientis in nematode worms). We have investigated the nature of natural selection acting on an outer membrane protein, the wsp gene in Wolbachia and its homologue map1 in Cowdria, thought likely to be involved in host-parasite interactions in these bacteria. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) at individual amino acid sites or at lineages within the gene's phylogeny was estimated using maximum likelihood models of codon substitution. The first hypothesis we tested was that this protein is under positive selection in the parasitic but not in the mutualistic Rickettsiaceae. This hypothesis was supported as positive selection and was detected in Cowdria and arthropod Wolbachia sequence evolution but not in the evolution of Wolbachia sequences from nematodes. Furthermore, this selection was concentrated outside the transmembrane region of the protein and, therefore, in the regions of the protein that may interact with the host. The second hypothesis tested was that positive selection would be stronger in the strains of arthropod Wolbachia that distort the host sex ratio than in those that induce cytoplasmic incompatibility. However, we found no support for this hypothesis. In conclusion, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that antagonistic coevolution causes faster evolution of surface protein sequences in parasites than in mutualists. Confirmation of this conclusion awaits the replication of these results both in additional genes and across more bacterial taxa. The regions of the wsp and map1 genes we identified as likely to be involved in host-parasite arms races should be examined in future studies of parasite virulence and host immune responses, and during the design of vaccines.

N2  - Previous comparison of a relatively small set of homologous genes from Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium revealed that genes nearer to the origin of replication had substitution rates lower than genes closer to the replication terminus. The recently completed sequences of numerous bacterial genomes have allowed us to test whether this effect of distance from the replication origin on substitution rates, as observed for the E. coli-S. typhimurium comparison, is a general feature of bacterial genomes. Extending the analysis to all 3,000 E. coli-S. typhimurium homologs confirmed the significant association between chromosomal position and synonymous site divergence. However, the effect, though still significant, is not as dramatic as originally thought. A similar association between relative chromosomal location and synonymous substitution rate was detected in the majority of other bacterial species comparisons within α- and γ- Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes but was absent in Chlamydiales. The opposite trend, i.e., a decrease in synonymous divergence with distance from the replication origin, was detected in Mycobacteria. Analysis of the patterns of nucleotide substitutions revealed that the distance effect is not affected by gene orientation and is mainly caused by an increase in rates of transversions, suggesting that this effect may not be caused by recombinational repair or biased gene conversion, as originally suggested.

N2  - Recent reports analyzing mitochondrial DNA sequences from Neandertal bones have claimed that Neandertals and modern humans are different species. The phylogenetic analyses carried out in these articles did not take into account the high substitution rate variation among sites observed in the human mitochondrial D-loop region and also lack an estimation of the parameters of the nucleotide substitution model. The separate phylogenetic position of Neandertals is not supported when these factors are considered. Our analysis shows that Neandertal-Human and Human-Human pairwise distance distributions overlap more than what previous studies suggested. We also show that the most ancient Neandertal HVI region is the most divergent when compared with modern human sequences. However, the opposite would be expected if the sequence had not been modified since the death of the specimen. Such incongruence is discussed in the light of diagenetic modifications in ancient Neandertal DNA sequences.

N2  - Methionine synthase is a key enzyme for the synthesis of the aspartate-derived methionine, the immediate precursor of S-adenosyl-methionine, which has been illustrated to be associated with plant growth and pathogen interactions. In this study we tested the positive selection hypothesis of molecular evolution of the methionine synthase gene in Dunnia sinensis. In the entire sample of 87 sequences, 22 haplotypes of introns and 16 haplotypes of exons were identified. An excess of polymorphism over the neutral expectation for the class of unique nucleotide polymorphisms was observed in both exon and intron sequences. Ten replacement substitutions versus six synonymous substitutions among lineages, although nonsignificant, revealed that some advantageous mutants might have been favored. The distribution of dN/dS > 1 at nodes between closely related haplotypes in the gene network also indicated weak and variable positive selection. Nevertheless, low levels of genetic diversity in exons (θ = 0.0052) and introns (θ = 0.0070) of the methionine synthase gene of the outcrossing Dunnia were also attributed to the endangered status of the species. The atpB-rbcL intergenic spacer of cpDNA and the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer of mtDNA were used to discern the relative effectiveness of natural selection from intrinsic evolutionary forces. The low levels of nucleotide polymorphisms in both organelle spacers and the significant population differentiation reflected the effect of population-species history and demography. Two major lineages of the methionine synthase gene genealogy were recovered corresponding to two geographic regions, a result that was consistent with organelle phylogenies. Both past fragmentation and recent habitat disturbance causing complete bottlenecks may have resulted in population decline and geographic isolation and may have led to the depletion of genetic variation at loci in nuclear and organelle genomes.

N2  - We investigate the effect of purifying selection at multiple sites on both the shape of the genealogy and the distribution of mutations on the tree. We find that the primary effect of purifying selection on a genealogy is to shift the distribution of mutations on the tree, whereas the shape of the tree remains largely unchanged. This result is relevant to the large number of coalescent estimation procedures, which generally assume neutrality for segregating polymorphisms--applying these estimators to evolutionarily constrained sequences could lead to a significant degree of bias. We also estimate the statistical power of several neutrality tests in detecting weak to moderate purifying selection and find that the power is quite good for some parameter combinations. This result contrasts with previous studies, which predicted low statistical power because of the minor effect that weak purifying selection has on the shape of a genealogy. Finally, we investigate the effect of Hill-Robertson interference among linked deleterious mutations on patterns of molecular variation. We find that dependence among selected loci can substantially reduce the efficacy of even fairly strong purifying selection.

N2  - According to population genetics models, genomic regions with lower crossing-over rates are expected to experience less effective selection because of Hill-Robertson interference (HRi). The effect of genetic linkage is thought to be particularly important for a selection of weak intensity such as selection affecting codon usage. Consistent with this model, codon bias correlates positively with recombination rate in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. However, in these species, the G+C content of both noncoding DNA and synonymous sites correlates positively with recombination, which suggests that mutation patterns and recombination are associated. To remove this effect of mutation patterns on codon bias, we used the synonymous sites of lowly expressed genes that are expected to be effectively neutral sites. We measured the differences between codon biases of highly expressed genes and their lowly expressed neighbors. In D. melanogaster we find that HRi weakly reduces selection on codon usage of genes located in regions of very low recombination; but these genes only comprise 4% of the total. In C. elegans we do not find any evidence for the effect of recombination on selection for codon bias. Computer simulations indicate that HRi poorly enhances codon bias if the local recombination rate is greater than the mutation rate. This prediction of the model is consistent with our data and with the current estimate of the mutation rate in D. melanogaster. The case of C. elegans, which is highly self-fertilizing, is discussed. Our results suggest that HRi is a minor determinant of variations in codon bias across the genome.

N2  - The evolution of self-fertilization is associated with a large reduction in the effective rate of recombination and a corresponding decline in effective population size. If many spontaneous mutations are slightly deleterious, this shift in the breeding system is expected to lead to a reduced efficacy of natural selection and genome-wide changes in the rates of molecular evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of the breeding system on molecular evolution in the highly self-fertilizing plant Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing its coding and noncoding genomic regions with those of its close outcrossing relative, the self-incompatible A. lyrata. More distantly related species in the Brassicaceae are used as outgroups to polarize the substitutions along each lineage. In contrast to expectations, no significant difference in the rates of protein evolution is observed between selfing and outcrossing Arabidopsis species. Similarly, no consistent overall difference in codon bias is observed between the species, although for low-biased genes A. lyrata shows significantly higher major codon usage. There is also evidence of intron size evolution in A. thaliana, which has consistently smaller introns than its outcrossing congener, potentially reflecting directional selection on intron size. The results are discussed in the context of heterogeneity in selection coefficients across loci and the effects of life history and population structure on rates of molecular evolution. Using estimates of substitution rates in coding regions and approximate estimates of divergence and generation times, the genomic deleterious mutation rate (U) for amino acid substitutions in Arabidopsis is estimated to be approximately 0.2-0.6 per generation.

T1  - Evolution of the Sulfide-Binding Function Within the Globin Multigenic Family of the Deep-Sea Hydrothermal Vent Tubeworm Riftia pachyptila

N2  - The giant extracellular hexagonal bilayer hemoglobin (HBL-Hb) of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent tube worm Riftia pachyptila is able to transport simultaneously O2 and H2S in the blood from the gills to a specific organ: the trophosome that harbors sulfide-oxidizing endosymbionts. This vascular HBL-Hb is made of 144 globins from which four globin types (A1, A2, B1, and B2) coevolve. The H2S is bound at a specific location (not on the heme site) onto two of these globin types. In order to understand how such a function emerged and evolved in vestimentiferans and other related annelids, six partial cDNAs corresponding to the six globins known to compose the multigenic family of R. pachyptila have been identified and sequenced. These partial sequences (ca. 120 amino acids, i.e., 80% of the entire protein) were used to reconstruct molecular phylogenies in order to trace duplication events that have led to the family organization of these globins and to locate the position of the free cysteine residues known to bind H2S. From these sequences, only two free cysteine residues have been found to occur, at positions Cys + 1 (i.e., 1 a.a. from the well-conserved distal histidine) and Cys + 11 (i.e., 11 a.a. from the same histidine) in globins B2 and A2, respectively. These two positions are well conserved in annelids, vestimentiferans, and pogonophorans, which live in sulfidic environments. The structural comparison of the hydrophobic environment that surrounds these cysteine residues (the sulfide-binding domain) using hydrophobic cluster analysis plots, together with the cysteine positions in paralogous strains, suggests that the sulfide-binding function might have emerged before the annelid radiation in order to detoxify this toxic compound. Moreover, globin evolutionary rates are highly different between paralogous strains. This suggests that either the two globin subfamilies involved in the sulfide-binding function (A2 and B2) have evolved under strong directional selective constraints (negative selection) and that the two other globins (A1 and B1) have accumulated more substitutions through positive selection or have evolved neutrally after a relaxation of selection pressures. A likely scenario on the evolution of this multigenic family is proposed and discussed from this data set.

N2  - The Atlantic auk assemblage includes four extant species, razorbill (Alca torda), dovekie (Alle alle), common murre (Uria aalge), and thick-billed murre (U. lomvia), and one recently extinct species, the flightless great auk (Pinguinus impennis). To determine the phylogenetic relationships among the species, a contiguous 4.2-kb region of the mitochondrial genome from the extant species was amplified using PCR. This region included one ribosomal RNA gene, four transfer RNA genes, two protein-coding genes, the control region, and intergenic spacers. Sets of PCR primers for amplifying the same region from great auk were designed from sequences of the extant species. The authenticity of the great auk sequence was ascertained by alternative amplifications, cloning, and separate analyses in an independent laboratory. Phylogenetic analyses of the entire assemblage, made possible by the great auk sequence, fully resolved the phylogenetic relationships and split it into two primary lineages, Uria versus Alle, Alca, and Pinguinus. A sister group relationship was identified between Alca and Pinguinus to the exclusion of Alle. Phylogenetically, the flightless great auk originated late relative to other divergences within the assemblage. This suggests that three highly divergent species in terms of adaptive specializations, Alca, Alle, and Pinguinus, evolved from a single lineage in the Atlantic Ocean, in a process similar to the initial adaptive radiation of alcids in the Pacific Ocean.

N2  - It has been proposed that two events of duplication of the entire genome occurred early in vertebrate history (2R hypothesis). Several phylogenetic studies with a few gene families (mostly Hox genes and proteins from the MHC) have tried to confirm these polyploidization events. However, data from a single locus cannot explain the evolutionary history of a complete genome. To study this 2R hypothesis, we have taken advantage of the phylogenetic position of the lamprey to study the history of gene duplications in vertebrates. We selected most gene families that contain several paralogous genes in vertebrates and for which lamprey genes and an out-group are known in databases. In addition, we isolated members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in lamprey. Hagfish genes were also analyzed and found to confirm the lamprey gene analysis. Consistent with the 2R hypothesis, the phylogenetic analysis of 33 selected gene families, dispersed through the whole genome, revealed that one period of gene duplication arose before the lamprey-gnathostome split and this was followed by a second period of gene duplication after the lamprey-gnathostome split. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests that numerous gene losses and other gene-genome duplications occurred during the evolution of the vertebrate genomes. Thus, the complexity of all the paralogy groups present in vertebrates should be explained by the contribution of genome duplications (2R hypothesis), extra gene duplications, and gene losses.

N2  - On the basis of the analysis of 64 glycosyltransferases from 14 species we propose that several successive duplications of a common ancestral gene, followed by divergent evolution, have generated the mannosyltransferases and the glucosyltransferases involved in asparagine-linked glycosylation (ALG) and phosphatidyl-inositol glycan anchor (PIG or GPI), which use lipid-related donor and acceptor substrates. Long and short conserved peptide motifs were found in all enzymes. Conserved and identical amino acid positions were found for the α2/6- and the α3/4-mannosyltransferases and for the α2/3-glucosyltransferases, suggesting unique ancestors for these three superfamilies. The three members of the α2-mannosyltransferase family (ALG9, PIG-B, and SMP3) and the two members of the α3-glucosyltransferase family (ALG6 and ALG8) shared 11 and 30 identical amino acid positions, respectively, suggesting that these enzymes have also originated by duplication and divergent evolution. This model predicts a common genetic origin for ALG and PIG enzymes using dolichyl-phospho-monosaccharide (Dol-P-monosaccharide) donors, which might be related to similar spatial orientation of the hydroxyl acceptors. On the basis of the multiple sequence analysis and the prediction of transmembrane topology we propose that the endoplasmic reticulum glycosyltransferases using Dol-P-monosaccharides as donor substrate have a multispan transmembrane topology with a first large luminal conserved loop containing the long motif and a small cytosolic conserved loop containing the short motif, different from the classical type II glycosyltransferases, which are anchored in the Golgi by a single transmembrane domain.

N2  - We characterized rates and patterns of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution in 242 duplicated gene pairs on chromosomes 2 and 4 of Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on their collinear order along the two chromosomes, the gene pairs were likely duplicated contemporaneously, and therefore comparison of genetic distances among gene pairs provides insights into the distribution of nucleotide substitution rates among plant nuclear genes. Rates of synonymous substitution varied 13.8-fold among the duplicated gene pairs, but 90% of gene pairs differed by less than 2.6-fold. Average nonsynonymous rates were ≈fivefold lower than average synonymous rates; this rate difference is lower than that of previously studied nonplant lineages. The coefficient of variation of rates among genes was 0.65 for nonsynonymous rates and 0.44 for synonymous rates, indicating that synonymous and nonsynonymous rates vary among genes to roughly the same extent. The causes underlying rate variation were explored. Our analyses tentatively suggest an effect of physical location on synonymous substitution rates but no similar effect on nonsynonymous rates. Nonsynonymous substitution rates were negatively correlated with GC content at synonymous third codon positions, and synonymous substitution rates were negatively correlated with codon bias, as observed in other systems. Finally, the 242 gene pairs permitted investigation of the processes underlying divergence between paralogs. We found no evidence of positive selection, little evidence that paralogs evolve at different rates, and no evidence of differential codon usage or third position GC content.

N2  - Motivated by a previous study indicating that polymorphism at an indel, Ind2, within the Brassica nigra COL1 gene is significantly associated with flowering time, we searched for evidence of selection in a sample of 41 complete sequences of B. nigra COL1. The within-gene population recombination rate is moderate, and all neutrality tests used in the present study failed to detect departure from the standard neutral model or evidence of selection. The haplotype structure of the 5'-half of the gene is primarily associated with the demographic history of the species and more specifically with the split between European and Ethiopian populations, whereas the structure of the 3'-half reflects the polymorphism at Ind2. This could be the result of selection or a combination of recombination and migration during the history of the sample of sequences. Without additional information on polymorphism in flanking areas, these two alternatives are difficult to tell apart. If selection acted on the gene, we suggest that if the indel itself is not the target of selection, among the polymorphic sites cosegregating with the polymorphism at Ind2, replacement polymorphisms around sites 890 and 1260 are the most likely quantitative trait nucleotides within the gene.

N2  - The ancestors of the archosaurs, a major branch of the diapsid reptiles, originated more than 240 MYA near the dawn of the Triassic Period. We used maximum likelihood phylogenetic ancestral reconstruction methods and explored different models of evolution for inferring the amino acid sequence of a putative ancestral archosaur visual pigment. Three different types of maximum likelihood models were used: nucleotide-based, amino acid-based, and codon-based models. Where possible, within each type of model, likelihood ratio tests were used to determine which model best fit the data. Ancestral reconstructions of the ancestral archosaur node using the best-fitting models of each type were found to be in agreement, except for three amino acid residues at which one reconstruction differed from the other two. To determine if these ancestral pigments would be functionally active, the corresponding genes were chemically synthesized and then expressed in a mammalian cell line in tissue culture. The expressed artificial genes were all found to bind to 11-cis-retinal to yield stable photoactive pigments with λmax values of about 508 nm, which is slightly redshifted relative to that of extant vertebrate pigments. The ancestral archosaur pigments also activated the retinal G protein transducin, as measured in a fluorescence assay. Our results show that ancestral genes from ancient organisms can be reconstructed de novo and tested for function using a combination of phylogenetic and biochemical methods.

N2  - Pax genes are defined by the presence of a paired box that encodes a DNA-binding domain of 128 amino acids. They are involved in the development of the central nervous system, organogenesis, and oncogenesis. The known Pax genes are divided into five groups within two supergroups. By means of a novel combination of evolutionary analysis, in vitro binding assays and in vivo functional analyses, we have identified the key residues that determine the differing DNA-binding properties of the two supergroups and of the Pax-2, 5, 8 and Pax-6 subgroups within supergroup I. The differences in binding properties between the two supergroups are largely caused by amino acid changes at residues 20 and 121 of the paired domain. Although the paired domains of the Pax-2, 5, 8 and the Pax-6 group differ by >19 amino acids, their distinct DNA-binding properties are determined almost completely by a single amino acid change. Thus, a small number of amino acid changes can account in large part for the divergence in binding properties among the known paired domains. Our approach for selecting candidate sites responsible for the functional divergence between genes should also be useful for studying other gene families.

N2  - Molecular phylogenies of lineages that split from one another in short succession are often difficult to resolve because different loci and different sites within the same locus yield incongruent relationships. The incongruity is commonly attributed to two causes: differential assortment of ancestral polymorphisms and homoplasy. To assess the relative contribution of these two causes, sequences of 57 segments from 51 loci in six primate lineages (human, chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, macaque, and tamarin, abbreviated as H, C, G, O, M, and T, respectively) were subjected to "partitioning" analysis, in which phylogenetically informative sites were identified in all 15 pairwise comparisons of each of the 57 segments and tallied for their support or lack thereof for each of the theoretically possible phylogenies. The six lineages include one of the best known cases of a difficult-to-resolve phylogeny: the trichotomy (H, C, G), in which the three lineages may have diverged from each other within a short period of time. In this period many of the ancestral polymorphisms apparently persisted and yielded phylogenetically incongruent signals. By contrast, no ancestral polymorphism is expected to have survived during the interval separating the divergences of the O, M, and T lineages from the ancestor of the (H, C, G) group. Any phylogenetic incompatibilities at sites in the O, M, and T lineages relative to the (H, C, G) group are therefore presumably the result of homoplasy. The frequency of homoplasy estimated in this manner is unexpectedly high: 12% for the (H, C, G) clade and 19% for the (H, C, G, O) clade. At least three-quarters of the 48% incompatibility observed in the (H, C) clade is attributable to the sorting out of ancestral polymorphisms coupled with intragenic recombination. Possible reasons for this high level of homoplasy in the O, M, and T lineages are discussed, and a computer simulation has been carried out to produce a model explaining the observed data.

N2  - It has long been recognized that the rates of molecular evolution vary amongst sites in proteins. The usual model for rate heterogeneity assumes independent rate variation according to a rate distribution. In such models the rate at a site, although random, is assumed fixed throughout the evolutionary tree. Recent work by several groups has suggested that rates at sites often vary across subtrees of the larger tree as well as across sites. This phenomenon is not captured by most phylogenetic models but instead is more similar to the covarion model of Fitch and coworkers. In this article we present methods that can be useful in detecting whether different rates occur in two different subtrees of the larger tree and where these differences occur. Parametric bootstrapping and orthogonal regression methodologies are used to test for rate differences and to make statements about the general differences in the rates at sites. Confidence intervals based on the conditional distributions of rates at sites are then used to detect where the rate differences occur. Such methods will be helpful in studying the phylogenetic, structural, and functional bases of changes in evolutionary rates at sites, a phenomenon that has important consequences for deep phylogenetic inference.

N2  - To understand the question of whether divergence of eukaryotic genes by gene duplications and domain shufflings proceeded gradually or intermittently during evolution, we have cloned and sequenced Giardia lamblia cDNAs encoding kinesins and kinesin-related proteins and have obtained 13 kinesin-related cDNAs, some of which are likely homologs of vertebrate kinesins involved in vesicle transfer to ER, Golgi, and plasma membrane. A phylogenetic tree of the kinesin family revealed that most gene duplications that gave rise to different kinesin subfamilies with distinct functions have been completed before the earliest divergence of extant eukaryotes. This suggests that the complex endomembrane system has arisen very early in eukaryotic evolution, and the diminutive ER and Golgi apparatus recognized in the giardial cells, together with the absence of mitochondria, might be characters acquired secondarily during the evolution of parasitism. To understand the divergence pattern of the kinesin family in the lineage leading to vertebrates, seven more Unc104-related cDNAs have been cloned from sponge, amphioxus, hagfish, and lamprey. The divergence pattern of the animal Unc104/KIF1 subfamily is characterized by two active periods in gene duplication interrupted by a considerably long period of silence, instead of proceeding gradually: animals underwent extensive gene duplications before the parazoan-eumetazoan split. In the early evolution of vertebrates around the cyclostome-gnathostome split, further gene duplications occurred, by which a variety of genes with similar structures over the entire regions were generated. This pattern of divergence is similar to those of animal genes involved in cell-cell communication and developmental control.

N2  - This article generalizes previous models for codon substitution and rate variation in molecular phylogeny. Particular attention is paid to (1) reversibility, (2) acceptance and rejection of proposed codon changes, (3) varying rates of evolution among codon sites, and (4) the interaction of these sites in determining evolutionary rates. To accommodate spatial variation in rates, Markov random fields rather than Markov chains are introduced. Because these innovations complicate maximum likelihood estimation in phylogeny reconstruction, it is necessary to formulate new algorithms for the evaluation of the likelihood and its derivatives with respect to the underlying kinetic, acceptance, and spatial parameters. To derive the most from maximum likelihood analysis of sequence data, it is useful to compute posterior probabilities assigning residues to internal nodes and evolutionary rate classes to codon sites. It is also helpful to search through tree space in a way that respects accepted phylogenetic relationships. Our phylogeny program LINNAEUS implements algorithms realizing these goals. Readers may consult our companion article in this issue for several examples.

N2  - The current article illustrates the practical advantages of some new models and statistical algorithms for codon substitution and spatial rate variation in molecular phylogeny. Our companion paper in this issue discusses at length the mathematical properties of these models for nucleotide and codon substitution, for site-to-site and branch-to-branch heterogeneity in rates of evolution, and for spatial correlation in the assignment of rates. In this study we summarize the theoretical background and apply the models and algorithms to data on β-globin, the complete HIV genome, and the mitochondrial genome. Our complex but realistic models enhance biological interpretation of sequence data and show substantial improvements in model fit over existing models. All the new statistical algorithms applied are incorporated in our phylogeny software LINNAEUS, which is tuned for performance and modeling flexibility.

N2  - Accelerated evolution of regulatory genes has been proposed as an explanation for decoupled rates of morphological and molecular evolution. The Hawaiian silversword alliance (Asteraceae-Madiinae) has evolved drastic differences in growth form, including rosette plants, cushion plants, shrubs, and trees, since its origin ~6 MYA. We have isolated genes in the DELLA subfamily of putative growth regulators from 13 taxa of Hawaiian and North American Madiinae. The Hawaiian taxa contain two copies of DaGAI that form separate clades within the Madiinae, consistent with an allotetraploid origin for the silversword alliance. DaGAI retains conserved features that have previously been identified in DELLA genes. Selective constraint in the Hawaiian DaGAI copies remains strong in spite of rapid growth form divergence in the silversword alliance, although the constraint was somewhat relaxed in the Hawaiian copies relative to the North American lineages. We failed to detect evidence for positive selection on individual codons. Notably, selective constraint remained especially strong in the gibberellin-responsive DELLA region for which the gene subfamily is named, which is truncated or deleted in all identified dwarf mutants in GAI homologues in different angiosperm species. In contrast with the coding region, however, ~900 bp of the upstream flanking region shows variable rates and patterns of evolution, which might reflect positive selection on regulatory regions.

N2  - The advent of full genome sequences provides exceptionally rich data sets to explore molecular and evolutionary mechanisms that shape divergence among and within genomes. In this study, we use multivariate analysis to determine the processes driving genome-wide patterns of amino usage in the obligate endosymbiont Buchnera and its close free-living relative Escherichia coli. In the AT-rich Buchnera genome, the primary source of variation in amino acid usage differentiates high- and low-expression genes. Amino acids of high-expression Buchnera genes are generally less aromatic and use relatively GC-rich codons, suggesting that selection against aromatic amino acids and against amino acids with AT-rich codons is stronger in high-expression genes. Selection to maintain hydrophobic amino acids in integral membrane proteins is a primary factor driving protein evolution in E. coli but is a secondary factor in Buchnera. In E. coli, gene expression is a secondary force driving amino acid usage, and a correlation with tRNA abundance suggests that translational selection contributes to this effect. Although this and previous studies demonstrate that AT mutational bias and genetic drift influence amino acid usage in Buchnera, this genome-wide analysis argues that selection is sufficient to affect the amino acid content of proteins with different expression and hydropathy levels.

N2  - Genomic nucleotide polymorphism in the virulent human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum was surveyed by sequencing a 3-kb region of chromosome 2 from 21 isolates, including the MSP4 and MSP5 genes. Extensive sequence polymorphism was observed in the coding regions of these genes and in the region downstream to MSP5, and the average pairwise divergence time of haplotypes in this region was estimated to be at least about 200,000 years. But nucleotide polymorphism was not found in the introns and was much reduced in the intergenic region. Over the entire region, nucleotide diversity was negatively correlated with a nucleotide content skewed toward thymine. Together with the previous evidence of limited nucleotide polymorphism in introns of P. falciparum, these data suggest the existence of a mechanism suppressing single-nucleotide polymorphism in regions of the P. falciparum genome with highly skewed nucleotide content.

N2  - We study the phylogeny of the placental mammals using molecular data from all mitochondrial tRNAs and rRNAs of 54 species. We use probabilistic substitution models specific to evolution in base paired regions of RNA. A number of these models have been implemented in a new phylogenetic inference software package for carrying out maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic inferences. We describe our Bayesian phylogenetic method which uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to provide samples from the posterior distribution of tree topologies. Our results show support for four primary mammalian clades, in agreement with recent studies of much larger data sets mainly comprising nuclear DNA. We discuss some issues arising when using Bayesian techniques on RNA sequence data.

N2  - The nuclear and plastid genomes of the plant cell form a coevolving unit which in interspecific combinations can lead to genetic incompatibility of compartments even between closely related taxa. This phenomenon has been observed for instance in Atropa-Nicotiana cybrids. We have sequenced the plastid chromosome of Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade), a circular DNA molecule of 156,688 bp, and compared it with the corresponding published sequence of its relative Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) to understand how divergence at the level of this genome can contribute to nuclear-plastid incompatibilities and to speciation. It appears that (1) regulatory elements, i.e., promoters as well as translational and replicational signal elements, are well conserved between the two species; (2) genes--including introns--are even more highly conserved, with differences residing predominantly in regions of low functional importance; and (3) RNA editotypes differ between the two species, which makes this process an intriguing candidate for causing rapid reproductive isolation of populations.

N2  - PgiC, a complex gene with 23 coding exons and 22 intervening introns, encodes the cytosolic isozyme of phosphoglucose isomerase (EC 5.3.1.9) in higher plants. Here, we report RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments that showed that PgiC in Clarkia (Onagraceae) and Arabidopsis thaliana has an intron in the 5' leader. Comparison of the EMBL accessions of the cDNA and genomic sequences showed that this is also the case in rice (Oryza sativa), suggesting that a leader intron is generally present in higher plant PgiC. The intron is bounded by consensus 5'-GT and AG-3' splice sites but showed alternative splicing in Clarkia, resulting in mature transcripts that differ by 8-19 nt in length. The intron is located 18 or 10 nt upstream of the start codon in Clarkia, 2 nt upstream in Arabidopsis, and 9 nt in rice. PgiC in Clarkia was duplicated before the divergence of the extant species, many of which have two expressed genes PgiC1 and PgiC2. Full-length transcripts of both genes identified the transcription start and made it possible to identify the leader intron and leader exon (between the transcription start and leader intron) from previously obtained genomic sequences of both genes in other Clarkia species. These data permit the comparison of evolution in the leader exon and intron with the exons and introns of the coding region, a topic that has not been studied previously. Both the leader exon and the leader intron resemble introns of the coding region in base substitution rate and accumulation of gaps. But the leader intron splice junctions are not strictly conserved in position as are those of the coding region introns. Also, in base composition, the leader intron resembles the other introns, whereas the leader exon more nearly resembles the coding exons. A difference in base composition between coding exons and flanking introns is known to be important for the recognition of splice sites. Thus, the marked difference in base composition between the leader exon and leader intron is probably maintained by selection despite a high rate of sequence divergence.

N2  - To understand more fully how amino acid composition of proteins has changed over the course of evolution, a method has been developed for estimating the composition of proteins in an ancestral genome. Estimates are based upon the composition of conserved residues in descendant sequences and empirical knowledge of the relative probability of conservation of various amino acids. Simulations are used to model and correct for errors in the estimates. The method was used to infer the amino acid composition of a large protein set in the Last Universal Ancestor (LUA) of all extant species. Relative to the modern protein set, LUA proteins were found to be generally richer in those amino acids that are believed to have been most abundant in the prebiotic environment and poorer in those amino acids that are believed to have been unavailable or scarce. It is proposed that the inferred amino acid composition of proteins in the LUA probably reflects historical events in the establishment of the genetic code.

N2  - Extant xenarthrans (armadillos, anteaters and sloths) are among the most derived placental mammals ever evolved. South America was the cradle of their evolutionary history. During the Tertiary, xenarthrans experienced an extraordinary radiation, whereas South America remained isolated from other continents. The 13 living genera are relicts of this earlier diversification and represent one of the four major clades of placental mammals. Sequences of the three independent protein-coding nuclear markers α2B adrenergic receptor (ADRA2B), breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA1), and von Willebrand Factor (VWF) were determined for 12 of the 13 living xenarthran genera. Comparative evolutionary dynamics of these nuclear exons using a likelihood framework revealed contrasting patterns of molecular evolution. All codon positions of BRCA1 were shown to evolve in a strikingly similar manner, and third codon positions appeared less saturated within placentals than those of ADRA2B and VWF. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses of a 47 placental taxa data set rooted by three marsupial outgroups resolved the phylogeny of Xenarthra with some evidence for two radiation events in armadillos and provided a strongly supported picture of placental interordinal relationships. This topology was fully compatible with recent studies, dividing placentals into the Southern Hemisphere clades Afrotheria and Xenarthra and a monophyletic Northern Hemisphere clade (Boreoeutheria) composed of Laurasiatheria and Euarchontoglires. Partitioned likelihood statistical tests of the position of the root, under different character partition schemes, identified three almost equally likely hypotheses for early placental divergences: a basal Afrotheria, an Afrotheria + Xenarthra clade, or a basal Xenarthra (Epitheria hypothesis). We took advantage of the extensive sampling realized within Xenarthra to assess its impact on the location of the root on the placental tree. By resampling taxa within Xenarthra, the conservative Shimodaira-Hasegawa likelihood-based test of alternative topologies was shown to be sensitive to both character and taxon sampling.

N2  - The complete nucleotide sequence (14,472 bp) of the mitochondrial genome of the nudibranch Roboastra europaea (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia) was determined. This highly compact mitochondrial genome is nearly identical in gene organization to that found in opisthobranchs and pulmonates (Euthyneura) but not to that in prosobranchs (a paraphyletic group including the most basal lineages of gastropods). The newly determined mitochondrial genome differs only in the relative position of the trnC gene when compared with the mitochondrial genome of Pupa strigosa, the only opisthobranch mitochondrial genome sequenced so far. Pupa and Roboastra represent the most basal and derived lineages of opisthobranchs, respectively, and their mitochondrial genomes are more similar in sequence when compared with those of pulmonates. All phylogenetic analyses (maximum parsimony, minimum evolution, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian) based on the deduced amino acid sequences of all mitochondrial protein-coding genes supported the monophyly of opisthobranchs. These results are in agreement with the classical view that recognizes Opisthobranchia as a natural group and contradict recent phylogenetic studies of the group based on shorter sequence data sets. The monophyly of opisthobranchs was further confirmed when a fragment of 2,500 nucleotides including the mitochondrial cox1, rrnL, nad6, and nad5 genes was analyzed in several species representing five different orders of opisthobranchs with all common methods of phylogenetic inference. Within opisthobranchs, the polyphyly of cephalaspideans and the monophyly of nudibranchs were recovered. The evolution of mitochondrial tRNA rearrangements was analyzed using the cox1+rrnL+nad6+nad5 gene phylogeny. The relative position of the trnP gene between the trnA and nad6 genes was found to be a synapomorphy of opisthobranchs that supports their monophyly.

N2  - Previous estimates of rates of synonymous (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) substitution among Neisseria meningitidis gene sequences suggested that the surface loops of the variable outer membrane protein PorB were under only weak selection pressure from the host immune response. These findings were consistent with studies indicating that PorB variants were not always protective in immunological and microbiological assays and questioned the suitability of this protein as a vaccine component. PorB, which is expressed at high levels on the surface of the meningococcus, has been implicated in mechanisms of pathogenesis and has also been used as a typing target in epidemiological investigations. In this work, using more precise estimates of selection pressures and recombination rates, we have shown that some residues in the surface loops of PorB are under very strong positive selection, as great as that observed in human immunodeficiency virus-1 surface glycoproteins, whereas amino acids within the loops and the membrane-spanning regions of the protein are under purifying selection, presumably because of structural constraints. Congruence tests showed that recombination occurred at a rate that was not sufficient to erase all phylogenetic similarity and did not greatly bias selection analysis. Homology models of PorB structure indicated that many strongly selected sites encoded residues that were predicted to be exposed to host immune responses, implying that this protein is under strong immune selection and requires further examination as a potential vaccine candidate. These data show that phylogenetic inference can be used to complement immunological and biochemical data in the choice of vaccine candidates.

N2  - Identification and characterization of antihemostatic components from hematophagous organisms are useful for the elucidation of the evolutionary mechanisms involved in adaptation to a highly complex host hemostatic system. Although many bioactive components involved in the regulation of the host's hemostatic system have been described, the evolutionary mechanisms of how arthropods adapted to a blood-feeding environment have not been elucidated. This study describes common origins of both blood coagulation inhibitors and platelet aggregation inhibitors (PAIs) from soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros. Neighbor-joining analysis indicates that fXa, thrombin, and PAIs share a common ancestor. Maximum parsimony analysis and a phylogeny based on root mean square deviation values of α-carbon backbone structures suggest a novel evolutionary pathway by which different antihemostatic functions have evolved through a series of paralogous gene duplication events. In this scenario, the thrombin inhibitors preceded the fXa and PAIs. This evolutionary model explains why the tick serine protease inhibitors have inhibition mechanisms that differ from that of the canonical bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI)-like inhibitors. Higher nonsynonymous-to-synonymous substitution rates indicate positive Darwinian selection for the fXa and PAIs. Comparison with hemostatic inhibitors of hard ticks suggests that the two main tick families have independently evolved novel antihemostatic mechanisms. Independent evolution of these mechanisms in ticks points to a rapid divergence between tick families that could be dated between 120 and 92 MYA. This coincides with current molecular phylogeny views on the early divergence of modern birds and placental mammals in the Late Cretaceous, which suggests that this event might have been a driving force in the evolution of hematophagy in ticks.

N2  - Species-level phylogenies derived from DNA sequence data provide a tool for estimating diversification rates and how these rates change over time, but to date there have been few empirical studies, particularly on insect groups. We use a densely sampled phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial DNA to investigate diversification rates in the North American tiger beetles (genus Cicindela). Using node ages estimated from sequence data and calibrated by biogeographical evidence, we estimate an average per-lineage diversification rate of at least 0.22 ± 0.08 species/Myr over the time interval since the most recent colonization that led to a radiation within the continent. In addition, we find evidence for a weak, recent increase in the net diversification rate. This is more consistent with a late Pleistocene increase in the speciation rate than with a constant rate of background extinction, but the results are sensitive to the dating method and taxon sampling. We discuss practical limitations to phylogenetic studies of diversification rates.

N2  - We investigated the usefulness of a parallel genetic algorithm for phylogenetic inference under the maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality criterion. Parallelization was accomplished by assigning each "individual" in the genetic algorithm "population" to a separate processor so that the number of processors used was equal to the size of the evolving population (plus one additional processor for the control of operations). The genetic algorithm incorporated branch-length and topological mutation, recombination, selection on the ML score, and (in some cases) migration and recombination among subpopulations. We tested this parallel genetic algorithm with large (228 taxa) data sets of both empirically observed DNA sequence data (for angiosperms) as well as simulated DNA sequence data. For both observed and simulated data, search-time improvement was nearly linear with respect to the number of processors, so the parallelization strategy appears to be highly effective at improving computation time for large phylogenetic problems using the genetic algorithm. We also explored various ways of optimizing and tuning the parameters of the genetic algorithm. Under the conditions of our analyses, we did not find the best-known solution using the genetic algorithm approach before terminating each run. We discuss some possible limitations of the current implementation of this genetic algorithm as well as of avenues for its future improvement.

N2  - Most of the sophisticated methods to estimate evolutionary divergence between DNA sequences assume that the two sequences have evolved with the same pattern of nucleotide substitution after their divergence from their most recent common ancestor (homogeneity assumption). If this assumption is violated, the evolutionary distance estimated will be biased, which may result in biased estimates of divergence times and substitution rates, and may lead to erroneous branching patterns in the inferred phylogenies. Here we present a simple modification for existing distance estimation methods to relax the assumption of the substitution pattern homogeneity among lineages when analyzing DNA and protein sequences. Results from computer simulations and empirical data analyses for human and mouse genes are presented to demonstrate that the proposed modification reduces the estimation bias considerably and that the modified method performs much better than the LogDet methods, which do not require the homogeneity assumption in estimating the number of substitutions per site. We also discuss the relationship of the substitution and mutation rate estimates when the substitution pattern is not the same in the lineages leading to the two sequences compared.

N2  - We determine the phylogenetic backbone of the East Asian mtDNA tree by using published complete mtDNA sequences and assessing both coding and control region variation in 69 Han individuals from southern China. This approach assists in the interpretation of published mtDNA data on East Asians based on either control region sequencing or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing. Our results confirm that the East Asian mtDNA pool is locally region-specific and completely covered by the two superhaplogroups M and N. The phylogenetic partitioning based on complete mtDNA sequences corroborates existing RFLP-based classification of Asian mtDNA types and supports the distinction between northern and southern populations. We describe new haplogroups M7, M8, M9, N9, and R9 and demonstrate by way of example that hierarchically subdividing the major branches of the mtDNA tree aids in recognizing the settlement processes of any particular region in appropriate time scale. This is illustrated by the characteristically southern distribution of haplogroup M7 in East Asia, whereas its daughter-groups, M7a and M7b2, specific for Japanese and Korean populations, testify to a presumably (pre-)Jomon contribution to the modern mtDNA pool of Japan.

N2  - Chalcone synthase (CHS) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids, which are important for the pigmentation of flowers and act as attractants to the pollinators. Genes encoding CHS constitute a multigene family in which the copy number varies among plant species and functional divergence appears to have occurred repeatedly. Plants of the Dendranthema genus have white, yellow, and pink flowers, exhibiting considerable variation in flower color. In this article, 18 CHS genes from six Dendranthema species were sequenced. Two of them were found to be pseudogenes. The functional Dendranthema CHS genes formed three well-supported subfamilies: SF1, SF2, and SF3. The inferred phylogeny of the CHS genes of Dendranthema and Gerbera suggests that those genes originated as a result of duplications before divergence of these two genera, and the function of Dendranthema CHS genes have diverged in a similar fashion to the Gerbera CHS genes; i.e., the genes of SF1 and SF3 code for typical CHS enzymes expressed during different stages of development, whereas the genes of SF2 code for another enzyme that is different from CHS in substrate specificity and reaction. Relative rate tests revealed that the Dendranthema CHS genes significantly deviated from clocklike evolution at nonsynonymous sites. Maximum likelihood analysis showed that the nonsynonymous-synonymous (ω = dN/dS) rate ratio for the lineage ancestral to SF2 was much higher than for other lineages, with some sites having a ratio well above one. Positive selective pressure appears to have driven the divergence of SF2 from SF1 and SF3.

N2  - Most duplicate genes are eliminated from a genome shortly after duplication, but those that remain are an important source of biochemical diversity. Here, I present evidence from genome-scale protein-protein interaction data, microarray expression data, and large-scale gene knockout data that this diversification is often asymmetrical: one duplicate usually shows significantly more molecular or genetic interactions than the other. I propose a model that can explain this divergence pattern if asymmetrically diverging duplicate gene pairs show increased robustness to deleterious mutations.

N2  - Phylogenetic rooting experiments demonstrate that two chloroplast genes from commelinoid monocot taxa that represent the closest living relatives of the pickerelweed family, Pontederiaceae, retain measurable signals regarding the position of that family's root. The rooting preferences of the chloroplast sequences were compared with those for artificial sequences that correspond to outgroups so divergent that their signal has been lost completely. These random sequences prefer the three longest branches in the unrooted ingroup topology and do not preferentially root on the branches favored by real outgroup sequences. However, the rooting behavior of the artificial sequences is not a simple function of branch length. The random outgroups preferentially root on long terminal ingroup branches, but many ingroup branches comparable in length to those favored by random sequences attract no or few hits. Nonterminal ingroup branches are generally avoided, regardless of their length. Comparisons of the ease of forcing sequences onto suboptimal roots indicate that real outgroups require a substantially greater rooting penalty than random outgroups for around half of the least-parsimonious candidate roots. Although this supports the existence of nonrandomized signal in the real outgroups, it also indicates that there is little power to choose among the optimal and nearly optimal rooting possibilities. A likelihood-based test rejects the hypothesis that all rootings of the subtree using real outgroup sequences are equally good explanations of the data and also eliminates around half of the least optimal candidate roots. Adding genes or outgroups can improve the ability to discriminate among different root locations. Rooting discriminatory power is shown to be stronger, in general, for more closely related outgroups and is highly correlated among different real outgroups, genes, and optimality criteria.

N2  - Diplomonads, such as Giardia, and their close relatives retortamonads have been proposed as early-branching eukaryotes that diverged before the acquisition-retention of mitochondria, and they have become key organisms in attempts to understand the evolution of eukaryotic cells. In this phylogenetic study we focus on a series of eukaryotes suggested to be relatives of diplomonads on morphological grounds, the "excavate taxa". Phylogenies of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) genes, α-tubulin, β-tubulin, and combined α- + β-tubulin all scatter the various excavate taxa across the diversity of eukaryotes. But all phylogenies place the excavate taxon Carpediemonas as the closest relative of diplomonads (and, where data are available, retortamonads). This novel relationship is recovered across phylogenetic methods and across various taxon-deletion experiments. Statistical support is strongest under maximum-likelihood (ML) (when among-site rate variation is modeled) and when the most divergent diplomonad sequences are excluded, suggesting a true relationship rather than an artifact of long-branch attraction. When all diplomonads are excluded, our ML SSU rRNA tree actually places retortamonads and Carpediemonas away from the base of the eukaryotes. The branches separating excavate taxa are mostly not well supported (especially in analyses of SSU rRNA data). Statistical tests of the SSU rRNA data, including an "expected likelihood weights" approach, do not reject trees where excavate taxa are constrained to be a clade (with or without parabasalids and Euglenozoa). Although diplomonads and retortamonads lack any mitochondria-like organelle, Carpediemonas contains double membrane-bounded structures physically resembling hydrogenosomes. The phylogenetic position of Carpediemonas suggests that it will be valuable in interpreting the evolutionary significance of many molecular and cellular peculiarities of diplomonads.

N2  - Current mathematical models of amino acid sequence evolution are often applied in variants that match their expected amino acid frequencies to those observed in a data set under analysis. This has been achieved by setting the instantaneous rate of replacement of a residue i by another residue j proportional to the observed frequency of the resulting residue j. We describe a more general method that maintains the match between expected and observed frequencies but permits replacement rates to be proportional to the frequencies of both the replaced and resulting residues, raised to powers other than 1. Analysis of a database of amino acid alignments shows that the description of the evolutionary process in a majority (approximately 70% of 182 alignments) is significantly improved by use of the new method, and a variety of analyses indicate that parameter estimation with the new method is well-behaved. Improved evolutionary models increase our understanding of the process of molecular evolution and are often expected to lead to improved phylogenetic inferences, and so it seems justified to consider our new variants of existing standard models when performing evolutionary analyses of amino acid sequences. Similar methods can be used with nucleotide substitution models, but we have not found these to give corresponding significant improvements to our ability to describe the processes of nucleotide sequence evolution.

N2  - A comprehensive survey of the Pseudoviridae (Ty1/copia) retroelement family was conducted using the GenBank sequence database and completed genome sequences of several model organisms. Plant genomes were the most abundant sources of Pseudoviridae, with the Arabidopsis thaliana genome having 276 distinct elements. A reverse transcriptase amino acid sequence phylogeny indicated that the Pseudoviridae comprises highly divergent members. Coding sequences for a representative subset of elements were analyzed to identify conserved domains and differences that may underlie functional divergence. With the exception of some fungal elements (e.g., Ty1), most Pseudoviridae encode Gag and Pol on a single open reading frame. In addition to the nearly ubiquitous RNA-binding motif of nucleocapsid, three new conserved domains were identified in Gag. pol-encoded aspartic protease was similar to the retroviral enzyme and could be mapped onto the HIV-1 structure. Pol was highly conserved throughout the family. The greatest divergence among Pol sequences was seen in the C-terminus of integrase (IN). We defined a large motif (GKGY) after the IN catalytic domain that is unique to the Pseudoviridae. Additionally, the extreme C-terminus of IN is rich in simple sequence motifs. A distinct lineage of Pseudoviridae in plants have envlike genes. This lineage has undergone a large expansion of Gag characterized by an α-helix-rich domain containing coiled-coil motifs. In several elements, this domain is flanked on both sides by RNA-binding domains. We propose that this monophyletic lineage defines a new Pseudoviridae genus, herein referred to as the Agrovirus.

N2  - The determinants of site-to-site variability in the rate of amino acid replacement in α/β-barrel enzyme structures are investigated. Of 125 available α/β-barrel structures, only 25 meet a variety of phylogenetic and statistical criteria necessary to ensure sufficient data for reliable analysis. These 25 enzyme structures (from a wide variety of taxa with diverse lifestyles in diverse habitats) differ greatly in size, number, and topology of domains in addition to the α/β-barrel, quaternary structure, metabolic role, reaction catalyzed, presence of prosthetic groups, regulatory mechanisms, use of cofactors, and catalytic mechanisms. Yet, with the exception of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, all structures have similar frequency distributions of amino acid replacement rates. Hence, site-specific variability in rates of evolution is largely independent of differences in biology, biochemistry, and molecular structure.  A correlation between site-specific rate variation and (1) distance from the active site, (2) solvent accessibility, and (3) treating glycines in unusual main-chain conformations as a separate class, explains approximately half the causal variation. Secondary structure exerts little influence on the pattern and distribution of replacements. Additional domains and subunits, side-chain hydrogen bonds, unusual side-chain rotamers, nonplanar peptide bonds, strained main-chain conformations, and buried hydrophilic-charged residues contribute little to variability among sites because they are rare. Nonlinear models do not improve the fits. In several enzymes, deviations from the typical pattern of replacements suggest the possible action of natural selection. A statistical analysis shows that, in all cases, much of the remaining unexplained variation is not attributable to chance and that other, as yet unidentified, causal relations must exist.

N2  - Inferring positive selection at single amino acid sites is of biological and medical importance. Parsimony-based and likelihood-based methods have been developed for this purpose, but the reliabilities of these methods are not well understood. Because the evolutionary models assumed in these methods are only rough approximations to reality, it is desirable that the methods are not very sensitive to violation of the assumptions made. In this study we show by computer simulation that the likelihood-based method is sensitive to violation of the assumptions and produces many false-positive results under certain conditions, whereas the parsimony-based method tends to be conservative. These observations, together with those from previous studies, suggest that the positively selected sites inferred by the parsimony-based method are more reliable than those inferred by the likelihood-based method.

N2  - Population-level studies using the major histocompatibility complex (Mhc) have linked specific alleles with specific diseases, but data requirements are high and the power to detect disease association is low. A novel use of Mhc population surveys involves mapping allelic substitutions onto the inferred structural molecular model to show functional differentiation related to local selective pressures. In the estuarine fish Fundulus heteroclitus, populations experiencing strong differences in antigenic challenges show significant differences in amino acid substitution patterns that are reflected as variation in the structural location of changes between populations. Fish from a population genetically adapted to severe chemical pollution also show novel patterns of DNA substitution at a highly variable Mhc class II B locus including strong signals of positive selection at inferred antigen-binding sites and population-specific signatures of amino acid substitution. Heavily parasitized fish from an extreme PCB-contaminated (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund) site show enhanced population-specific substitutions in the a-helix portion of the inferred antigen-binding region. In contrast, fish from an unpolluted site show a significantly different pattern focused on the first strand of the B-pleated sheet. Whether Mhc population profile differences represent the direct effects of chemical toxicants or indirect parasite-mediated selection, the result is a composite habitat-specific signature of strong selection and evolution affecting the genetic repetoire of the major histocompatibility complex.

N2  - Members of the serpin (serine proteinase inhibitor) superfamily have been identified in higher multicellular eukaryotes (plants and animals) and viruses but not in bacteria, archaea, or fungi. Thus, the ancestral serpin and the origin of the serpin inhibitory mechanism remain obscure. In this study we characterize 12 serpin-like sequences in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms, extending this protein family to all major branches of life. Notably, these organisms live in dramatically different environments and some are evolutionarily distantly related. A sequence-based analysis suggests that all 12 serpins are inhibitory. Despite considerable sequence divergence between the proteins, in four of the 12 sequences the region of the serpin that determines proteinase specificity is highly conserved, indicating that these inhibitors are likely to share a common target. Inhibitory serpins are typically prone to polymerization upon heating; thus, the existence of serpins in the moderate thermophilic bacterium Thermobifida fusca, the thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis, and the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum is of particular interest. Using molecular modeling, we predict the means by which heat stability in the latter protein may be achieved without compromising inhibitory activity.

N2  - Neurotransmitter receptors (neuroreceptors) are classified into two types, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ligand-gated ion channels. The former occupies a small part of the large GPCR superfamily, whereas the latter consists of three superfamilies. In these superfamilies, humans and rodents share almost the same set of neuroreceptor genes. This neuroreceptor gene set is good material to examine the degree of selective constraint exerted on each member gene of a given superfamily. If there are any neuroreceptor genes under the degree of selective constraint that is very different from that of the other member genes, they may have influenced the functional features characteristic of human neural activities. With the aim of identifying such neuroreceptor genes, we collected sequence data of orthologous neuroreceptor genes for humans, mice, and rats by database searches. This data set included ortholog pairs for 141 kinds of neuroreceptor genes, which covered almost the whole set of neuroreceptor genes known to be expressed in the human brain. The degree of selective constraint was estimated by computing the ratio (dN/dS) of the number of nonsynonymous substitutions to that of synonymous substitutions. We found that the dN/dS ratio ranged widely and its distribution fitted a gamma distribution. In particular, we found that four neuroreceptor genes are under the significantly relaxed selective constraint. They are an ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit NMDA-2C, two GABAA receptor subunits, i.e., GABAA-ε and GABAA-θ, and a dopamine receptor D4. Interestingly, these neuroreceptors have been reported to be associated with cognitive abilities such as memory and learning, and responsiveness to novel stimuli. These cognitive abilities can influence the behavioral features of an individual. Thus, it suggests that the relaxed-constraint neuroreceptor genes have evolved, assuring that the nervous system responds to a variety of stimuli with proper flexibility.

N2  - Wild brook charr populations (Salvelinus fontinalis) completely introgressed with the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) of arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) are found in several lakes of northeastern Quebec, Canada. Mitochondrial respiratory enzymes of these populations are thus encoded by their own nuclear DNA and by arctic charr mtDNA. In the present study we performed a comparative sequence analysis of the whole mitochondrial genome of both brook and arctic charr to identify the distribution of mutational differences across these two genomes. This analysis revealed 47 amino acid replacements, 45 of which were confined to subunits of the NADH dehydrogenase complex (Complex I), one in the cox3 gene (Complex IV), and one in the atp8 gene (Complex V). A cladistic approach performed with brook charr, arctic charr, and two other salmonid fishes (rainbow trout [Oncorhynchus mykiss] and Atlantic salmon [Salmo salar]) revealed that only five amino acid replacements were specific to the charr comparison and not shared with the other two salmonids. In addition, five amino acid substitutions localized in the nad2 and nad5 genes denoted negative scores according to the functional properties of amino acids and, therefore, could possibly have an impact on the structure and functional properties of these mitochondrial peptides. The comparison of both brook and arctic charr mtDNA with that of rainbow trout also revealed a relatively constant mutation rate for each specific gene among species, whereas the rate was quite different among genes. This pattern held for both synonymous and nonsynonymous nucleotide positions. These results, therefore, support the hypothesis of selective constraints acting on synonymous codon usage.

N2  - Database searches of the Caenorhabditis elegans and human genomic DNA sequences revealed genes encoding ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) and RNase H2 in each genome. The human genome contains a single copy of each gene, whereas C. elegans has four genes encoding RNase H1-related proteins and one gene for RNase H2. By analyzing the mRNAs produced from the C. elegans genes, examining the amino acid sequence of the predicted protein, and expressing the proteins in Esherichia coli we have identified two active RNase H1-like proteins. One is similar to other eukaryotic RNases H1, whereas the second RNase H (rnh-1.1) is unique. The rnh-1.0 gene is transcribed as a dicistronic message with three dsRNA-binding domains; the mature mRNA is transspliced with SL2 splice leader and contains only one dsRNA-binding domain. Formation of RNase H1 is further regulated by differential cis-splicing events. A single rnh-2 gene, encoding a protein similar to several other eukaryotic RNase H2L's, also has been examined. The diversity and enzymatic properties of RNase H homologues are other examples of expansion of protein families in C. elegans. The presence of two RNases H1 in C. elegans suggests that two enzymes are required in this rather simple organism to perform the functions that are accomplished by a single enzyme in more complex organisms. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the active C. elegans RNases H1 are distantly related to one another and that the C. elegans RNase H1 is more closely related to the human RNase H1. The database searches also suggest that RNase H domains of LTR-retrotransposons in C. elegans are quite unrelated to cellular RNases H1, but numerous RNase H domains of human endogenous retroviruses are more closely related to cellular RNases H.

N2  - The cave bear spread from Western Europe to the Near East during the Riss glaciation (250 KYA) before becoming extinct approximately 12 KYA. During that period, the climatic conditions were highly dynamic, oscillating between glacial and temperate episodes. Such events have constrained the geographic repartition of species, the movements of populations and shaped their genetic diversity. We retrieved and analyzed ancient DNA from 21 samples from five European caves ranging from 40 to 130 KYA. Combined with available data, our data set accounts for a total of 41 sequences of cave bear, coming from 18 European caves. We distinguish four haplogroups at the level of the mitochondrial DNA control region. The large population size of cave bear could account for the maintenance of such polymorphism. Extensive gene flow seems to have connected European populations because two haplogroups cover wide geographic areas. Furthermore, the extensive sampling of the deposits of the Scladina cave located in Belgium allowed us to correlate changes in climatic conditions with the intrapopulational genetic diversity over 90 KY.

N2  - Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) and other long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing elements comprise a significant portion (8%) of the human genome and are likely vestiges of retroviral infections during primate evolution. Many of the HERVs present in human DNA have retained functional promoter, enhancer, and polyadenylation signals, and these regulatory sequences have the potential to modify the expression of nearby genes. To identify retroviral elements that contribute to the transcription of human genes, we screened sequence databases for chimeric (viral-cellular) transcripts. These searches revealed a fusion transcript containing the LTR of an HERV-E element linked to the Opitz syndrome gene Mid1. We confirmed the authenticity of the chimeric transcript by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and established that the Mid1 mRNA isoform was transcribed from a retroviral LTR. The identification of a retroviral first exon suggested the existence of alternative promoters for Mid1 because nonretroviral (native) 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) had been reported previously for this gene. Although Mid1 transcripts could be detected in all tissues tested, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction indicated that the retroviral promoter contributes significantly to the level of Mid1 transcripts in placenta and embryonic kidney, where chimeric mRNAs were found to represent 25% and 22% of overall Mid1 mRNAs, respectively. Transient transfection studies supported a role for the LTR as a strong tissue-specific promoter in placental and embryonic kidney cell lines and suggested a function for the LTR as an enhancer. These findings provide further evidence that some endogenous retroviruses have evolved a biological function by contributing transcriptional regulatory elements to cellular genes.

N2  - Microsatellites, which have rapidly become the preferred markers in population genetics, reliably assign individual chinook salmon to the winter, fall, late-fall, or spring chinook runs in the Sacramento River in California's Central Valley (Banks et al. 2000 . Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 57:915-927). A substantial proportion of this discriminatory power comes from Ots-2, a simple CA repeat, which is expected to evolve rapidly under the stepwise mutation model. We have sequenced a 300-bp region around this locus and typed 668 microsatellite-flanking sequence haplotypes to explore further the basis of this microsatellite divergence. Three sites of nucleotide polymorphism in the Ots-2 flanking sequence define five haplotypes that are shared by the Californian and Canadian populations. The Ots-2 microsatellite alleles are nonrandomly distributed among these five haplotypes in a pattern of gametic disequilibrium that is also shared among populations. Divergence between the winter run and other Central Valley stocks appears to be caused by a combination of surprisingly static evolution at Ots-2 within a context of more rapidly changing haplotype frequencies.

N2  - We introduce a new approach to estimate the evolutionary distance between two sequences. This approach uses a tree with three leaves: two of them correspond to the studied sequences, whereas the third is chosen to handle long-distance estimation. The branch lengths of this tree are obtained by likelihood maximization and are then used to deduce the desired distance. This approach, called TripleML, improves the precision of evolutionary distance estimates, and thus the topological accuracy of distance-based methods. TripleML can be used with neighbor-joining-like (NJ-like) methods not only to compute the initial distance matrix but also to estimate new distances encountered during the agglomeration process. Computer simulations indicate that using TripleML significantly improves the topological accuracy of NJ, BioNJ, and Weighbor, while conserving a reasonable computation time. With randomly generated 24-taxon trees and realistic parameter values, combining NJ with TripleML reduces the number of wrongly inferred branches by about 11% (against 2.6% and 5.5% for BioNJ and Weighbor, respectively). Moreover, this combination requires only about 1.5 min to infer a phylogeny of 96 sequences composed of 1,200 nucleotides, as compared with 6.5 h for FastDNAml on the same machine (PC 466 MHz).

N2  - We characterized two novel 7SL RNA-derived short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) families (Tu types I and II) and a novel tRNA-derived SINE family (Tu type III) from the tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri). Tu type I contains a monomer unit of a 7SL RNA-derived Alu-like sequence and a tRNA-derived region that includes internal RNA polymerase III promoters. Tu type II has a similar hybrid structure, although the monomer unit of the 7SL RNA-derived sequence is replaced by a dimer. Along with the primate Alu, the galago Alu type II, and the rodent B1, these two families represent the fourth and fifth 7SL RNA-derived SINE families to be identified. Furthermore, comparison of the Alu domains of Tu types I and II with those of other 7SL RNA-derived SINEs reveals that the nucleotides responsible for stabilization of the Alu domain have been conserved during evolution, providing the possibility that these conserved nucleotides play an indispensable role in retropositional activity. Evolutionary relationships among these 7SL RNA-derived SINE families, as well as phylogenetic relationships of their host species, are discussed.

N2  - A growing number of genes involved in sex and reproduction have been demonstrated to be rapidly evolving. Here, we show that genes expressed solely in spermatozoa represent a highly diverged subset among mouse and human tissue-specific orthologs. The average rate of nonsynonymous substitutions per site (Ka) is significantly higher in sperm proteins (mean Ka = 0.18; N = 35) than in proteins expressed specifically in all other tissues (mean Ka = 0.074; N = 473). No differences, however, are found in the synonymous substitution rate (Ks) between tissues, suggesting that selective forces, and not mutation rate, explain the high rate of replacement substitutions in sperm proteins. Four out of 19 sperm-specific genes with characterized function demonstrated evidence of strong positive Darwinian selection, including a protein involved in gene regulation, Protamine-1 (PRM1), a protein involved in glycolysis, GAPDS, and two egg-binding proteins, Adam-2 precursor (ADAM2) and sperm-adhesion molecule-1 (SAM1). These results demonstrate the rapid evolution of sperm-specific genes and highlight the molecular action of sexual selection on a variety of characters involved in mammalian sperm function.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to test for evidence that savannah baboons (Papio cynocephalus) underwent a population expansion in concert with a hypothesized expansion of African human and chimpanzee populations during the late Pleistocene. The rationale is that any type of environmental event sufficient to cause simultaneous population expansions in African humans and chimpanzees would also be expected to affect other codistributed mammals. To test for genetic evidence of population expansion or contraction, we performed a coalescent analysis of multilocus microsatellite data using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations were used to estimate the posterior probability density of demographic and genealogical parameters. The model was designed to allow interlocus variation in mutational and demographic parameters, which made it possible to detect aberrant patterns of variation at individual loci that could result from heterogeneity in mutational dynamics or from the effects of selection at linked sites. Results of the MCMC simulations were consistent with zero variance in demographic parameters among loci, but there was evidence for a 10- to 20-fold difference in mutation rate between the most slowly and most rapidly evolving loci. Results of the model provided strong evidence that savannah baboons have undergone a long-term historical decline in population size. The mode of the highest posterior density for the joint distribution of current and ancestral population size indicated a roughly eightfold contraction over the past 1,000 to 250,000 years. These results indicate that savannah baboons apparently did not share a common demographic history with other codistributed primate species.

N2  - Changes in gene expression and regulation--due in particular to the evolution of cis-regulatory DNA sequences--may underlie many evolutionary changes in phenotypes, yet little is known about the distribution of such variation in populations. We present in this study the first survey of experimentally validated functional cis-regulatory polymorphism. These data are derived from more than 140 polymorphisms involved in the regulation of 107 genes in Homo sapiens, the eukaryote species with the most available data. We find that functional cis-regulatory variation is widespread in the human genome and that the consequent variation in gene expression is twofold or greater for 63% of the genes surveyed. Transcription factor-DNA interactions are highly polymorphic, and regulatory interactions have been gained and lost within human populations. On average, humans are heterozygous at more functional cis-regulatory sites (>16,000) than at amino acid positions (<13,000), in part because of an overrepresentation among the former in multiallelic tandem repeat variation, especially (AC)n dinucleotide microsatellites. The role of microsatellites in gene expression variation may provide a larger store of heritable phenotypic variation, and a more rapid mutational input of such variation, than has been realized. Finally, we outline the distinctive consequences of cis-regulatory variation for the genotype-phenotype relationship, including ubiquitous epistasis and genotype-by-environment interactions, as well as underappreciated modes of pleiotropy and overdominance. Ordinary small-scale mutations contribute to pervasive variation in transcription rates and consequently to patterns of human phenotypic variation.

N2  - Calibration of nucleotide sequence divergence rates provides an important method by which to test many hypotheses of evolution. In the absence of an adequate fossil record, geological events, rather than the first appearances of sister taxa in the geological record, are often used to calibrate molecular clocks. The formation of the Isthmus of Panama, which isolated the tropical western Atlantic and eastern Pacific oceans, is one such event that is frequently used to infer rates of nucleotide sequence divergence. Isthmian calibrations assume that morphologically similar "geminate" species living now on either side of the isthmus were isolated geographically by the latest stages of seaway closure 3.1-3.5 MYA. Here, I have applied calibration dates from the fossil record to cytochrome c oxidase-1 (CO1) and nuclear histone-3 (H3) divergences among six pairs of geminates in the Arcidae to test this hypothesis. Analysis of CO1 first and third positions yield geminate divergences that predate final seaway closure, and on the basis of CO1 first positions, times for all six geminates are significantly greater than 3.5 Myr. H3 sequences produce much more recent geminate divergences, some that are younger than 3.1 Myr. But H3-derived estimates for all arcid geminates are not significantly different from both 0 and 15 Myr. According to CO1, one of the two most divergent pairs, Arca mutabilis and A. imbricata, split more than 30 MYA. This date is compatible with the fossil record, which indicates that these species were morphologically distinct at least 16-21 MYA. Across all CO1 nucleotide sites, divergence rates for arcids are slower than the rates reported for other taxa on the basis of isthmian calibrations, with the exception of rates determined from the least divergent species pair in larger surveys of multiple transisthmian pairs. Rate differences between arcids and some taxa may be real, but these data suggest that divergence rates can be greatly overestimated when dates corresponding to final closure of the Central American Seaway are used to calibrate the molecular clocks of marine organisms.

N2  - Genes of the RBR family are characterized by the RBR signature (two RING finger domains separated by an IBR/DRIL domain). The RBR family is widespread in eukaryotes, with numerous members in animals (mammals, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis) and plants (Arabidopsis). But yeasts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Schizosaccharomyces pombe, contain only two RBR genes. We determined the phylogenetic relationships and the most likely orthologs in different species of several family members for which functional data are available. These include: (1) parkin, whose mutations are involved in forms of familial Parkinson's disease; (2) the ariadne genes, recently characterized in Drosophila and mammals; (3) XYbp and Dorfin, two mammalian genes whose products interact with the centrosome; (4) XAP3, RBCK1, and UIP28, mammalian genes encoding Protein Kinase-C-binding proteins; and (5) ARA54, an androgen receptor coactivator. Because several of these genes are involved in ubiquitination, we used phylogenetic and structural analyses to explore the hypothesis that all RBR proteins might play a role in ubiquitination. We show that the involvement of RBR proteins in ubiquitination predates the animals-plants-fungi divergence. On the basis of the evidence provided by cases of gene fusion, we suggest that Ariadne proteins interact with cullin domain-containing proteins to form complexes with ubiquitin-ligase activity.

N2  - A method is described that allows the assessment of treelikeness of phylogenetic distance data before tree estimation. This method is related to statistical geometry as introduced by Eigen, Winkler-Oswatitsch, and Dress (1988 [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 85:5913-5917]), and in essence, displays a measure for treelikeness of quartets in terms of a histogram that we call a δ plot. This allows identification of nontreelike data and analysis of noisy data sets arising from processes such as, for example, parallel evolution, recombination, or lateral gene transfer. In addition to an overall assessment of treelikeness, individual taxa can be ranked by reference to the treelikeness of the quartets to which they belong. Removal of taxa on the basis of this ranking results in an increase in accuracy of tree estimation. Recombinant data sets are simulated, and the method is shown to be capable of identifying single recombinant taxa on the basis of distance information alone, provided the parents of the recombinant sequence are sufficiently divergent and the mixture of tree histories is not strongly skewed toward a single tree. δ Plots and taxon rankings are applied to three biological data sets using distances derived from sequence alignment, gene order, and fragment length polymorphism.

N2  - We have sequenced four new mitochondrial genomes to improve the stability of the tree for placental mammals; they are two insectivores (a gymnure, Echinosorex gymnurus and Formosan shrew Soriculus fumidus); a Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros); and the New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri). A revision to the hedgehog sequence (Erinaceus europaeus) is also reported. All five are from the Laurasiatheria grouping of eutherian mammals. On this new data set there is a strong tendency for the hedgehog and its relative, the gymnure, to join with the other Laurasiatherian insectivores (mole and shrews). To quantify the stability of trees from this data we define, based on nuclear sequences, a major four-way split in Laurasiatherians. This ([Xenarthra, Afrotheria], [Laurasiatheria, Supraprimates]) split is also found from mitochondrial genomes using either protein-coding or RNA (rRNA and tRNA) data sets. The high similarity of the mitochondrial and nuclear-derived trees allows a quantitative estimate of the stability of trees from independent data sets, as detected from a triplet Markov analysis. There are significant changes in the mutational processes within placental mammals that are ignored by current tree programs. On the basis of our quantitative results, we expect the evolutionary tree for mammals to be resolved quickly, and this will allow other problems to be solved.

N2  - Despite extensive phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSUrRNA) genes, the deep-level relationships among kinetoplastids remain poorly understood, limiting our grasp of their evolutionary history, especially the origins of their bizarre mitochondrial genome organizations. In this study we examine the SSUrRNA data in the light of a new marker--cytoplasmic heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) sequences. Our phylogenetic analyses divide kinetoplastids into four main clades. Clades 1-3 include the various bodonid kinetoplastids. Trypanosomatids comprise the fourth clade. SSUrRNA analyses give vastly different and poorly supported positions for the root of the kinetoplastid tree, depending on the out-group and analysis method. This is probably due to the extraordinary length of the branch between kinetoplastids and any out-group. In contrast, almost all hsp90 analyses place the root between clade 1 (including Dimastigella, Rhynchomonas, several Bodo spp., and probably Rhynchobodo) and all other kinetoplastids. Maximum likelihood and maximum likelihood distance analyses of hsp90 protein and second codon-position nucleotides place trypanosomatids adjacent to Bodo saltans and Bodo cf. uncinatus (clade 3), as (weakly) do SSUrRNA analyses. Hsp90 first codon- plus second codon-position nucleotide analyses return a slightly different topology. We show that this may be an artifact caused, in part, by the different evolutionary behavior of first- and second-codon positions. This study provides the most robust evidence to date that trypanosomatids are descended from within bodonids and that B. saltans is a close relative of trypanosomatids. A total reevaluation of the high-level systematics within kinetoplastids is needed. We confirm that the interlocking network organization of kinetoplast DNA seen in trypanosomatids is a derived condition within kinetoplastids but suggest that open-conformation minicircles may have arisen early in kinetoplastid evolution. Further understanding of the evolution of kinetoplast structure and RNA editing is hampered by a paucity of data from basal (i.e., clade 1) bodonids.

N2  - The fully sequenced chloroplast genomes of maize (subfamily Panicoideae), rice (subfamily Bambusoideae), and wheat (subfamily Pooideae) provide the unique opportunity to investigate the evolution of chloroplast genes and genomes in the grass family (Poaceae) by whole-genome comparison. Analyses of nucleotide sequence variations in 106 cereal chloroplast genes with tobacco sequences as the outgroup suggested that (1) most of the genic regions of the chloroplast genomes of maize, rice, and wheat have evolved at similar rates; (2) RNA genes have highly conservative evolutionary rates relative to the other genes; (3) photosynthetic genes have been under strong purifying selection; (4) between the three cereals, 14 genes which account for about 28% of the genic region have evolved with heterogeneous nucleotide substitution rates; and (5) rice genes tend to have evolved more slowly than the others at loci where rate heterogeneity exists. Although the mechanism that underlies chloroplast gene diversification is complex, our analyses identified variation in nonsynonymous substitution rates as a genetic force that generates heterogeneity, which is evidence of selection in chloroplast gene diversification at the intrafamilial level. Phylogenetic trees constructed with the variable nucleotide sites of the chloroplast genes place maize basal to the rice-wheat clade, revealing a close relationship between the Bambusoideae and Pooideae.

N2  - A number of statistical tests for detecting population growth are described. We compared the statistical power of these tests with that of others available in the literature. The tests evaluated fall into three categories: those tests based on the distribution of the mutation frequencies, on the haplotype distribution, and on the mismatch distribution. We found that, for an extensive variety of cases, the most powerful tests for detecting population growth are Fu's FS test and the newly developed R2 test. The behavior of the R2 test is superior for small sample sizes, whereas FS is better for large sample sizes. We also show that some popular statistics based on the mismatch distribution are very conservative.

N2  - A group of transposons, named maT, with characteristics intermediate between mariner and Tc1 transposons, is described. Two defective genomic copies of MdmaT from the housefly Musca domestica, with 85% identity, were found flanking and imbedded in the MdαE7 esterase gene involved in organophosphate insecticide resistance. Two cDNA clones, with 99% identity to each other and 72%-89% identity to the genomic copies were also obtained, but both represented truncated versions of the putative open reading frame. A third incomplete genomic copy of MdmaT was also identified upstream of the putative M. domestica period gene. The MdmaT sequences showed high identity to the transposable element Bmmar1 from the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, and to previously unidentified sequences in the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans. A total of 16 copies of full-length maT sequences were identified in the C. elegans genome, representing three variants of the transposon, with 34%-100% identity amongst them. Twelve of the copies, named CemaT1, were virtually identical, with eight of them encoding a putative full length, intact transposase. Secondary structure predictions and phylogenetic analyses confirm that maT elements belong to the mariner-Tc1 superfamily of transposons, but their intermediate sequence and predicted structural characteristics suggest that they belong to a unique clade, distinct from either mariner-like or Tc1-like elements.

N2  - ATP-dependent protease complexes are present in all three kingdoms of life, where they rid the cell of misfolded or damaged proteins and control the level of certain regulatory proteins. They include the proteasome in Eukaryotes, Archea, and Actinomycetales and the HslVU (ClpQY) complex in other eubacteria. We showed that genes homologous to eubacterial HslV (ClpQ) and HslU (ClpY) are present in the genome of trypanosomatid protozoa and are expressed. The features of the cDNAs indicated that bona fide trypanosomatid messengers had been cloned and ruled out bacterial contamination as the source of the material. The N-terminal microsequence of HslV from Leishmania infantum (Protozoa: Kinetoplastida) permitted the identification of the propeptide cleavage site and indicated that an active protease is present. High similarities (≥57.5%) with the prototypical HslV and HslU from Escherichia coli and conservation of residues essential for biochemical activity suggested that a functional HslVU complex is present in trypanosomatid protozoa. The structure of the N-termini of HslV and HslU further suggested mitochondrial localization. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HslV and HslU from trypanosomatids clustered with eubacterial homologs but did not point to any particular bacterial lineage. Because typical eukaryotic 20S proteasomes are present in trypanosomatids, we concluded that the eubacterial HslVU and the eukaryotic multicatalytic protease are simultaneously present in these organisms. To our knowledge this is the first report of a eubacterial HslVU complex in eukaryotes and, consequently, of the simultaneous occurrence of both a proteasome and HslVU in living cells.

N2  - Kruppel-related zinc finger proteins, with 564 members in the human genome, probably constitute the largest individual family of transcription factors in mammals. Approximately 30% of these proteins carry a potent repressor domain called the Kruppel associated box (KRAB). Depending on the structure of the KRAB domain, these proteins have been further divided into three subfamilies (A + B, A + b, and A only). In addition, some KRAB zinc finger proteins contain another conserved motif called SCAN. To study their molecular evolution, an extensive comparative analysis of a large panel of KRAB zinc finger genes was performed. The results show that both the KRAB A + b and the KRAB A subfamilies have their origin in a single member or a few closely related members of the KRAB A + B family. The KRAB A + B family is also the most prevalent among the KRAB zinc finger genes. Furthermore, we show that internal duplications of individual zinc finger motifs or blocks of several zinc finger motifs have occurred quite frequently within this gene family. However, zinc finger motifs are also frequently lost from the open reading frame, either by functional inactivation by point mutations or by the introduction of a stop codon. The introduction of a stop codon causes the exclusion of part of the zinc finger region from the coding region and the formation of graveyards of degenerate zinc finger motifs in the 3'-untranslated region of these genes. Earlier reports have shown that duplications of zinc finger genes commonly occur throughout evolution. We show that there is a relatively low degree of sequence conservation of the zinc finger motifs after these duplications. In many cases this may cause altered binding specificities of the transcription factors encoded by these genes. The repetitive nature of the zinc finger region and the structural flexibility within the zinc finger motif make these proteins highly adaptable. These factors may have been of major importance for their massive expansion in both number and complexity during metazoan evolution.

N2  - DNA sequence data from humans can provide insight into the history of modern humans and the genetic variability in human populations. We report here a study of human DNA sequence variation at an X-linked noncoding region of 10,346 bp. The sample consists of 62 X chromosomes from Africa, Europe, and Asia. Forty-four polymorphic sites were found among the 62 sequences, resulting in 23 different haplotypes. Statistical analyses of the data led to the following inferences. (1) There is strong evidence of human population expansion in the relatively recent past, and this population expansion has had a significant effect on the pattern of polymorphism at this locus. (2) Non-African populations were unlikely to have been derived from a very small number of African lineages. (3) There was considerable geographic subdivision in the ancient human population, which could be an important reason why many studies failed to detect population expansion. (4) The long-term effective population size of humans is between 12,000 and 15,000. And (5) a non-African specific variant was found at a frequency of 35% in non-Africans, an estimate supported by the genotyping of additional 80 non-African and 106 African X chromosomes. This variant could have arisen in Eurasia more than 140,000 years ago, predating the emergence of modern humans. Moreover, this haplotype and all other haplotypes coalesced to the most recent common ancestor of the sample, which was estimated to be older than 490,000 years. Therefore, this region may have a long history in Eurasia.

N2  - We have attempted to quantify the frequency and effects of slightly deleterious mutations (SDMs), those that have selective effects close to the reciprocal of the effective population size of a species, by comparing the level of selective constraint in protein-coding genes of related species that have different present-day effective population sizes. In our two comparisons, the species with the smaller effective population size showed lower constraint, implying that SDMs had become fixed. The fixation of SDMs was supported by the observation of a higher fraction of radical to conservative amino acid substitutions in species with smaller effective population sizes. The fraction of strongly deleterious mutations (which rarely become fixed) is >70% in most species. Only ~10% or fewer of mutations seem to behave as SDMs, but SDMs could comprise a substantial fraction of mutations in protein-coding genes that have a chance of becoming fixed between species.

N2  - The alpha 2B adrenergic receptor (A2AB) is a heptahelical G protein-coupled receptor for catecholamines. We compared the almost complete coding region (about 1,175 bp) of the A2AB gene from 48 mammalian species, including eight newly determined sequences, representing all the 18 eutherian and two marsupial orders. Comparison of the encoded proteins reveals that residues thought to be involved in agonist binding are highly conserved, as are the regions playing a role in G protein-coupling. The three extracellular loops are generally more variable than the transmembrane domains and two of the intracellular loops, indicating a lower functional constraint. However, the greatest variation is observed in the very long, third intracellular loop, where only a few residues and a polyglutamyl tract are preserved. Although this polyglutamyl domain displays a great variation in length, its presence in all described A2ABs confirms its proposed role in agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the third intracellular loop. Phylogenetic analyses of the A2AB data set, including Bayesian methods, recognized the superordinal clades Afrotheria, Laurasiatheria, and Euarchontoglires, in agreement with recent molecular evidence, albeit with lower support. Within Afrotheria, A2AB strongly supports the paenungulate clade and the association of the continental African otter shrew with Malagasy tenrecs. Among Laurasiatheria, A2AB confirms the nesting of whales within the artiodactyls, as a sister group to hippopotamus. Within the Euarchontoglires, there is constant support for rodent monophyly.

N2  - Variation in the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of rDNA was examined throughout the range of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) to analyze the usefulness of this molecular marker for phylogeographic analysis. The results were compared with those previously obtained with mtDNA, a region exhaustively analyzed along the brown trout distribution. ITS2 was essentially conserved at all populations sampled, no informative characters being detected across the main lineages described in this species. Conversely, ITS1 showed a greater homogenization than other genetic markers at a microgeographic scale, with variation partitioning into several major phylogenetic groups. Phylogeographic patterns were partially congruent between both ITS1 and mtDNA. The main discrepancies were the detection of intra-individual variation and putative recombinant ITS1 sequences in hybridization areas between genetically different, yet historically overlapping, assemblages. Also, the existence of an ancient ITS1 sequence in the Mediterranean-southeastern area (rMEDA), not revealed by mtDNA analysis, was evidenced after rDNA ITS1 analysis.

N2  - Recent adaptive radiations provide excellent model systems for understanding speciation, but rapid diversification can cause problems for phylogenetic inference. Here we use gene genealogies to investigate the phylogeny of recent speciation in the heliconiine butterflies. We sequenced three gene regions, intron 3 (≈550 bp) of sex-linked triose-phosphate isomerase (Tpi), intron 3 (≈450 bp) of autosomal mannose-phosphate isomerase (Mpi), and 1,603 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II (COI and COII), for 37 individuals from 25 species of Heliconius and related genera. The nuclear intron sequences evolved at rates similar to those of mitochondrial coding sequences, but the phylogenetic utility of introns was restricted to closely related geographic populations and species due to high levels of indel variation. For two sister species pairs, Heliconius erato-Heliconius himera and Heliconius melpomene-Heliconius cydno, there was highly significant discordance between the three genes. At mtDNA and Tpi, the hypotheses of reciprocal monophyly and paraphyly of at least one species with respect to its sister could not be distinguished. In contrast alleles sampled from the third locus, Mpi, showed polyphyletic relationships between both species pairs. In all cases, recent coalescence of mtDNA lineages within species suggests that polyphyly of nuclear genes is not unexpected. In addition, very similar alleles were shared between melpomene and cydno, implying recent gene flow. Our finding of discordant genealogies between genes is consistent with models of adaptive speciation with ongoing gene flow and highlights the need for multiple locus comparisons to resolve phylogeny among closely related species.

N2  - Two longstanding issues on the molecular clock hypothesis are studied in this article. First, is there a global molecular clock in mammals? Although many authors have observed unequal rates of nucleotide substitution among mammalian lineages, some authors have proposed a global clock for all eutherians, i.e., a single global rate of 2.2 x 10-9 substitutions per nucleotide site per year. We reexamine this issue using noncoding, nonrepetitive DNA from Old World monkeys (OWMs), chimpanzee, and human. First, using the minimal date of 6 MYA for the human-chimpanzee divergence and more than 2.5 million base pairs of genomic sequences from human and chimpanzee, we estimate a maximal rate of 0.99 x 10-9 for noncoding, nonrepetitive genomic regions for these two species. This estimate is less than half of the proposed global rate and much smaller than the commonly used rate (3.5 x 10-9) for eutherians. Further, using a minimal date of 23 MYA for the human-OWM divergence, we estimate a maximal rate of 1.5 x 10-9 for both introns and fourfold degenerate sites in humans and OWMs. In addition, with the New World monkey (NWM) lineage as an outgroup, we estimate that the rate of substitution in introns is 30% higher in the OWM lineage than in the human lineage. Clearly, there is no global molecular clock in eutherians. Second, although many studies have indicated considerable variation in the mutation rate among regions of the mammalian genome, a recent study proposed a uniform rate. Using new and existing intron sequence data from higher primates, we find significant rate variation among genomic regions and a positive correlation between the rate of substitution and the GC content, refuting the claim of a uniform rate.

N2  - Equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENTs) are integral membrane proteins which enable the movement of hydrophilic nucleosides and nucleoside analogs down their concentration gradients across cell membranes. ENTs were only recently characterized at the molecular level, and little is known about the tertiary structure or distribution of these proteins in nonmammalian organisms. To identify conserved regions, residues, and motifs of ENTs that may indicate functionally important parts of the protein and to better understand the evolutionary history of this protein family, we conducted an exhaustive analysis to characterize and compare ENTs in taxonomically diverse organisms. We have identified novel ENT family members in humans, mice, fish, tunicates, slime molds, and bacteria. This greatly extends our knowledge on the distribution of the ENTs in eukaryotes, and we have identified, for the first time, family members in bacteria. The prokaryote ENTs are attractive models for future studies on transporter tertiary structure and mechanism of substrate translocation. Using sequence similarities, we have identified regions, residues, and motifs that are conserved across all family members. These areas are presumably correlated with function and therefore are important targets for future analysis. Finally, we propose an evolutionary history for the ENT family which clarifies the origin(s) of multiple isoforms in different taxa.

N2  - Transposable elements (TEs) play a fundamental role in the evolution of genomes. In Drosophila they are disproportionately represented in regions of low recombination, such as in heterochromatin. This pattern has been attributed to selection against repeated elements in regions of normal recombination, owing to either (1) the slightly deleterious position effects of TE insertions near or into genes, or (2) strong selection against chromosomal abnormalities arising from ectopic exchange between TE repeats. We have used defective non-long-terminal repeat (LTR) TEs that are "dead-on-arrival" (DOA) and unable to transpose in order to estimate spontaneous deletion rates in different constituents of chromatin. These elements have previously provided evidence for an extremely high rate of spontaneous deletion in Drosophila as compared with mammals, potentially explaining at least part of the differences in the genome sizes in these organisms. However, rates of deletion could be overestimated due to positive selection for a smaller likelihood of ectopic exchange. In this article, we show that rates of spontaneous deletion in DOA repeats are as high in heterochromatin and regions of euchromatin with low recombination as they are in regions of euchromatin with normal recombination. We have also examined the age distribution of five non-LTR families throughout the genome. We show that there is substantial variation in the historical pattern of transposition of these TEs. The overrepresentation of TEs in the heterochromatin is primarily due to their longer retention time in heterochromatin, as evidenced by the average time since insertion. Fragments inserted recently are much more evenly distributed in the genome. This contrast demonstrates that the accumulation of TEs in heterochromatin and in euchromatic regions of low recombination is not due to biased transposition but by greater probabilities of fixation in these regions relative to regions of normal recombination.

N2  - Accumulating prokaryotic gene and genome sequences reveal that the exchange of genetic information through both homology-dependent recombination and horizontal (lateral) gene transfer (HGT) is far more important, in quantity and quality, than hitherto imagined. The traditional view, that prokaryotic evolution can be understood primarily in terms of clonal divergence and periodic selection, must be augmented to embrace gene exchange as a creative force, itself responsible for much of the pattern of similarities and differences we see between prokaryotic microbes. Rather than replacing periodic selection on genetic diversity, gene loss, and other chromosomal alterations as important players in adaptive evolution, gene exchange acts in concert with these processes to provide a rich explanatory paradigm--some of whose implications we explore here. In particular, we discuss (1) the role of recombination and HGT in giving phenotypic "coherence" to prokaryotic taxa at all levels of inclusiveness, (2) the implications of these processes for the reconstruction and meaning of "phylogeny," and (3) new views of prokaryotic adaptation and diversification based on gene acquisition and exchange.

N2  - The family of eukaryotic adenylyl cyclases consists of a very large group of 12 transmembrane adenylyl cyclases and a very small group of soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Orthologs of human sAC are present in rat Dictyostelium and bacteria but absent from the completely sequenced genomes of Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Saccharomyces cereviciae. sAC consists of two cyclase domains and a long ~1,000 amino acid C-terminal (sCKH) region. This sCKH region and one cyclase domain have been found in only four bacterial genes; the sCKH region was also detected in bacterial Lux-transcription factors and in complex bacterial and fungal kinases. The phylogenies of the kinase and cyclase domains are identical to the phylogeny of the corresponding sCKH domain, suggesting that the sCKH region fused with the other domains early during evolution in bacteria. The amino acid sequences of sAC proteins yield divergence times from the human lineage for rat and Dictyostelium that are close to the reported divergence times of many other proteins in these species. The combined results suggest that the sCKH region was fused with one cyclase domain in bacteria, and a second cyclase domain was added in bacteria or early eukaryotes. The sAC was retained in a few bacteria and throughout the entire evolution of the human lineage but lost independently from many bacteria and from the lineages of plants, yeast, worms, and flies. We conclude that within the family of adenylyl cyclases, soluble AC was poorly fixed during evolution, whereas membrane-bound AC has expanded to form the subgroups of prevailing adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases.

N2  - Considerable data exist on coding sequences of histones in a wide variety of organisms. Much more restricted information is available on total histone gene complement, gene organization, transcriptional regulation, and histone mRNA processing. In particular, there is a significant phylogenetic gap in information for the urochordates, a subphylum near the invertebrate-vertebrate transition. In this study, we show that the appendicularian Oikopleura dioica has a histone gene complement that is similar to that of humans, though its genome size is 40- to 50-fold smaller. At a total length of 3.5 kb, the H3, H4, H1, H2A, and H2B quintet cluster is the most compact described thus far, but despite very rapid early developmental cleavage cycles, no extensive tandem repeats of the cluster were present. The high degree of variation within each of the complements of O. dioica H2A and H2B subtypes resembled that found in plants as opposed to more closely related vertebrate and invertebrate species, and developmental stage-specific expression of different subtypes was observed. The linker histone H1 was present in relatively few copies per haploid genome and contained short N- and C-terminal tails, a feature similar to that of copepods but different from many standard model organisms. The 3'UTRs of the histone genes contained both the consensus stem-loop sequence and the polyadenylation signals but lacked the consensus histone downstream element that is involved in the processing of histone mRNAs in echinoderms and vertebrates. Two types of transcripts were found, i.e., those containing both the stem-loop and a polyA tail as well as those cleaved at the normal site just 3' of the stem-loop. The O. dioica data are an important addition to the limited number of eukaryotes for which sufficiently extensive information on histone gene complements is available. Increasingly, it appears that understanding the evolution of histone gene organization, transcriptional regulation, and mRNA processing will depend at least as much on comparative analysis of constraints imposed by certain life history features and cell biological characteristics as on projections based on simple phylogenetic relationships.

N2  - The general assumption that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) does not undergo recombination has been challenged recently in invertebrates. Here we present the first direct evidence for recombination in the mtDNA of a vertebrate, the flounder Platichthys flesus. The control region in the mtDNA of this flatfish is characterized by the presence of a variable number of tandem repeats and a high level of heteroplasmy. Two types of repeats were recognized, differing by two C-T point mutations. Most individuals carry a pure "C" or a pure "T" array, but one individual showed a compound "CT" array. Such a compound array is evidence for recombination in the mtDNA control region from the flounder.

N2  - We present models describing the acquisition and deletion of novel sequences in populations of microorganisms. We infer that most novel sequences are neutral. Thus, sequence duplications and gene transfer between organisms sharing the same environment are rarely expected to generate adaptive functions. Two classes of models are considered: (1) a homogeneous population with constant size, and (2) an island model in which the population is subdivided into patches that are in contact through slow migration. Distributions of gene frequencies are derived in a Moran model with overlapping generations. We find that novel, neutral or near-neutral coding sequences in microorganisms will not be fixed globally because they offer large target sizes for mutations and because the populations are so large. At most, such genes may have a transient presence in only a small fraction of the population. Consequently, a microbial population is expected to have a very large diversity of transient neutral gene content. Only sequences that are under strong selection, globally or in individual patches, can be expected to persist. We suggest that genome size is maintained in microorganisms by a quasi-steady state mechanism in which random fluctuations in the effective acquisition and deletion rates result in genome sizes that vary from patch to patch. We assign the genomic identity of a global population to those genes that are required for the participation of patches in the genetic sweeps that maintain the genomic coherence of the population. In contrast, we stress the influence of sequence loss on the isolation and the divergence (speciation) of novel patches from a global population.

N2  - To find out whether the polymorphism of TPE repeats of the hobo transposable element observed in some populations results from polymorphism within flies or from variability between flies, or both, we carried out isofemale line analyses of 25 populations. We found that polymorphic populations result from the presence of polymorphic flies combined with interfly variability within these populations. The fact that populations display different levels of polymorphism, i.e., different types of element and different frequencies of polymorphic flies, can be used to differentiate between qualitatively identical populations. This showed that the geographical structuring previously observed is reinforced and, in particular, that the western European populations, which have 3TPE and 5TPE elements, display a centrifugal decrease in the frequency of 5TPE hobo elements which start in western France. This gradient supports the hypothesis of a dynamic invasion by this type of elements: a total invasion by 3TPE elements, followed by further invasions involving other types of hobo elements. Moreover, the analysis of numerous sequences in current populations revealed the existence of seven types of never-previously described hobo elements with regard to TPE repeats. This diversity, which contrasts with the conservation of other parts of the element, highlights the high mutation rate of the S region.

N2  - Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are structurally similar to defective class II elements, but their high copy number and the size and sequence conservation of most MITE families suggest that they can be amplified by a replicative mechanism. Here we present a genome-wide analysis of the Emigrant family of MITEs from Arabidopsis thaliana. In order to be able to detect divergent ancient copies, and low copy number subfamilies with a different internal sequence we have developed a computer program to look for Emigrant elements based solely on the terminal inverted-repeat sequence. We have detected 151 Emigrant elements of different subfamilies. Our results show that different bursts of amplification, probably of few active, or master, elements, have occurred at different times during Arabidopsis evolution. The analysis of the insertion sites of the Emigrant elements shows that recently inserted Emigrant elements tend to be located far from open reading frames, whereas more ancient Emigrant subfamilies are preferentially found associated to genes.

N2  - Until recently, phylogenetic analyses have been routinely based on homologous sequences of a single gene. Given the vast number of gene sequences now available, phylogenetic studies are now based on the analysis of multiple genes. Thus, it has become necessary to devise statistical methods to combine multiple molecular data sets. Here, we compare several models for combining different genes for the purpose of evaluating the likelihood of tree topologies. Three methods of branch length estimation were studied: assuming all genes have the same branch lengths (concatenate model), assuming that branch lengths are proportional among genes (proportional model), or assuming that each gene has a separate set of branch lengths (separate model). We also compared three models of among-site rate variation: the homogenous model, a model that assumes one gamma parameter for all genes, and a model that assumes one gamma parameter for each gene. On the basis of two nuclear and one mitochondrial amino acid data sets, our results suggest that, depending on the data set chosen, either the separate model or the proportional model represents the most appropriate method for branch length analysis. For all the data sets examined, one gamma parameter for each gene represents the best model for among-site rate variation. Using these models we analyzed alternative mammalian tree topologies, and we describe the effect of the assumed model on the maximum likelihood tree. We show that the choice of the model has an impact on the best phylogeny obtained.

N2  - Although a general agreement on the major groups of eutherian orders and their phylogenetic affiliations is emerging, the evolutionary affiliations among the members constituting these groups are still subject to debate. A prominent example is the recently published molecular evidence that challenges the long assumed monophyly of primates, displaying the colugo or flying lemur (Cynocephalus, Dermoptera) as a sister to anthropoid primates (Arnason et al. 2002 ) and positioning them after the prosimian primates (tarsiers and strepsirhines) split off.  The phylogenetic analysis of the complete mitochondrial (mt) genome sequence of Cynocephalus variegatus presented in this study first appears to corroborate interpretations of primates as a paraphyletic group. However, more detailed analyses disclosed that mt nucleotide composition and consequently amino acid (AA) composition varied considerably among the species analyzed. This led us to assume that the flying lemur may be incorrectly grouped with anthropoids on the basis of similar mt nucleotide and AA compositions, rather than reflecting the true evolutionary relationship.  To reanalyze the flying lemur's evolutionary association with other eutherian orders from a completely different molecular perspective, a molecular cladistic approach was applied. To this end, we determined the presence/absence pattern of transposable elements that provide a nearly homoplasy-free and copious source of molecular evolutionary markers, with well-defined character polarity. We could identify transposable elements, both on a multilocus and single-locus level, being present in all extant primate infraorders but absent in the flying lemur, thus clearly supporting the monophyly of primates by retropositional evidence.
