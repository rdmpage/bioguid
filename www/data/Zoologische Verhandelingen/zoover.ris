N2  - The history and taxonomic status of the species-group names Lophochroa goffini Finsch, 1863, and Cacatua tanimberensis Roselaar & Prins, 2000, both used to name the Tanimbar Corella, are reviewed nomenclaturally. It is confirmed that Lophochroa goffini (sensu Finsch, 1863) is not applicable to the Tanimbar Corella, but represents a junior synonym of Cacatua ducorpsii Pucheran, 1853, as shown by Roselaar & Prins (2000). The substitute name Cacatua tanimberensis they proposed is an objective junior synonym of L. goffini and subjective junior synonym of C. ducorpsii. From the nomenclatural point of view, the Tanimbar Corella remains undescribed and is here named.

N2  - Blyth’s Catalogue is sometimes cited from 1849 and sometimes from 1852. Both dates can be found in Peters’s Check-list, each, in different volumes, appearing to be accepted. Consequently and inconsistently both are found in other works. The cover is dated 1849. The evidence, however, shows that while much was printed in 1849 publication was not before September 1852. Meanwhile Blyth’s ’Supplemental Note’ appeared in 1849. Most of the new taxa described in that were described then to ensure that Blyth’s names, already in his proof sheets for his Catalogue, obtained priority. In Peters’s Check-list most of these names have been cited correctly, i.e. from his Supplemental Note. However, a few exceptions need attention and their dates need to be corrected in works of reference. In two instances the source cited should be changed. These cases and a few others are discussed. Blyth’s honest intent to give credit to his correspondents for their new names that he gave to new taxa is explained.

N2  - Ornithological literature has been extremely inconsistent in assigning authorship for the new names proposed in ‘A Catalogue of the Birds in The Museum of the Hon. East-India Company’ by Horsfield & Moore, or by Moore in parallel to it. The corrected dates of separate publications by Moore and the ICZN Code allow all assignments to be resolved. Hodgson should never be cited for a new name in this work. All but six taxa are attributable to Moore alone, five to Horsfield & Moore and one taxon, Acanthis flavirostris brevirostris although described by Moore, was described by Bonaparte a few months earlier. The contents are set out to show which families were covered by this unfinished work. Evidence is also presented to show that volume 2 appeared as a single part in 1858, not in two parts (in 1856 and 1858) as suggested by the title page and some recent writers.

N2  - The Large-tailed Nightjar Caprimulgus macrurus Horsfield, 1821, complex, as currently recognized, comprises 12 taxa which are grouped into four species based on their territorial songs. However, species limits are based on very small samples of a limited number of taxa in the complex. To further document species limits in the complex, we analysed 109 sound recordings representing all recognized taxa. Principal components analysis suggests the existence of six vocally distinct groups within the complex. Discriminant function analysis assigned 98-100% of individuals correctly to their group. Each of these groups differs diagnosably from all other groups by up to eight vocal characters, and each group is recognizable by ear. We propose to treat these six groups as species based on multiple differences in territorial songs, the lack of intermediate vocal types, the concordance of the geographic distribution of vocal types and morphology-based taxonomic boundaries and the sympatry of two groups in northeastern peninsular India without signs of intergradation. Three groups correspond to the currently recognized species C. atripennis Jerdon, 1845, C. celebensis Ogilvie-Grant, 1894, and C. manillensis Walden, 1875. ’C. macrurus’ comprises three vocally distinct species: (i) C. macrurus (s.s.), with a territorial song that is remarkably constant throughout its extensive range, (ii) C. andamanicus Hume, 1873, a population endemic to the Andaman Islands, and (iii) a previously unrecognized species from the east Indonesian islands of Flores and Sumba, which we describe in this paper. Known specimens of this new species were previously assigned to C. macrurus schlegelii A.B. Meyer, 1874, but the species differs from all other taxa in the complex by its vocalizations. Preliminary playback experiments support the recognition of these populations as a species. Finally, our acoustic data corroborate the allocation of the taxon aequabilis Ripley, 1945 to C. atripennis, of jungei Neumann, 1939 to C. celebensis, and of johnsoni Deignan, 1955 and salvadorii Sharpe, 1875 to C. macrurus.

N2  - After a short characterization of the political and economical developments in 17th-18th century Netherlands and some general remarks on the Houttuyn family and its social status, the ancestry of Martinus Houttuyn is thoroughly established. In the medical thesis he presented at Leiden University in 1749 many interesting facts about his early life and scientific development, hitherto overlooked, were found. The six principal zoological publications of Houttuyn are reviewed and are listed together with many others on a wide diversity of subjects. The esteem he received during his lifetime from compatriots as well as foreign scientists, in contrast to the near oblivion in the 19th-20th century, is demonstrated. We tried to entangle the vicissitudes of his cabinet of natural history. A copy of the catalogue of the 1787 auction of the zoological specimens is added.

The importance of new characters such as the morphology of the first uropod is stressed. The following species are fully redescribed and illustrated: B. elegans Watkin, 1938, B. gracilis G.O. Sars, 1891, B. guilliamsoniana (Bate, 1857), B. nana Toulmond, 1966, B. pelagica (Bate, 1857), B. pilosa Lindström, 1855, B. sarsi Watkin, 1938, and B. tenuipes Meinert, 1877. B. elegans exhibits unusual variation, of which the taxonomical significance is still unclear. It has been observed for the first time that all species of the genus exhibit an unusual sexual dimorphism on the mandibular palp: in the adult males, the ventral border of the terminal article has a comb of stiff setae which is lacking in females and immature males. Furthermore, a locking system holding together the inner plates of the maxilliped is described and illustrated. A previously overlooked vestigial dactylus on the second and the fifth pereiopod is described.

N2  - Since the study of the genus Corallimorphus was started, the main taxonomic character used to separate species has been the ratio of the number of marginal tentacles to that of the discal ones. Polyps with a marginal:discal (m:d) tentacle ratio of 2:1 and 4:1 collected by the “Challenger” expedition were described as two distinct species, Corallimorphus rigidus and Corallimorphus profundus respectively (Moseley, 1877a, 1877b; Hertwig, 1882, 1888). This feature remained important in the taxonomy of the genus. For example, Fautin et al. (2002) subdivided the genus Corallimorphus into two groups of species: Corallimorphus rigidus, C. ingens, C. atlanticus, C. denhartogi (ratio of marginal: discal tentacles 2:1) were referred to the «rigidus» group. C. profundus and C. pilatus (ratio of marginal: discal tentacles comes to 4:1) to the «profundus» group. Here we discuss whether this character is of a high taxonomic value or not.

While describing Epitonium hartogi spec. nov., special attention is given to the ontogenetic development within the eggcapsules, the structure and microsculpture of the opercula, the radulae, and the microsculpture on the radular jaws. These characters proved to be at least partly diagnostic in the epitoniid species Epitonium albidum, E. billeeanum, E. costulatum, E. hoeksemai, E. ingridae, E. lochi, E. millecostatum, E. pyramidalis, E. twilae, E. ulu and Nitidiscala tincta.

N2  - South Chilean fjords contain an astonishing diverse benthic macrofauna of which anthozoans form a major portion. Azooxanthellate solitary scleractinians, which were hitherto known from major depths, were found as shallow as 8 m during several expeditions to the south Chilean fjord region. At some sites, stony corals dominate the macrofauna and form dense aggregations, which may cover several 10’s of square meters in depths below 25 m. The discovery of these communities in shallow water for the first time allows for in situ observations and structural analysis of these populations by means of SCUBA diving. For further studies, living and dead corals were sampled, photographed, and dried for preservation. Several specimens and tissue samples were preserved in 96% ethanol. The sampled specimens were identified as Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper, 1794) and Caryophyllia Lamarck, 1801 spec. nov. Specimens of D. dianthus found on a shipwreck allowed for growth rate estimations. Minimum growth rates were estimated as 2.3 mm longitudinal growth per year and 1.6 mm diameter growth. Due to increasing human impact on benthic communities in Chilean fjords, especially through salmon farming, it cannot be excluded that these coral communities are in danger before they are even studied.

As well as the geographic range, the depth range of this species has been extended to 110-700 m. The species had been distinguished primarily on whether the oral disc had four lobes (I. quadrilobatus) or eight (Synactinernus flavus) – we conclude their number is largely related to size of the animal. Other features that Carlgren had used to differentiate the genera (and species) are inconsistently present and do not correlate with lobe number.

N2  - The morphology of the column margin is an especially important feature in the taxonomy and biology of members of the sea anemone family Actiniidae. Despite the importance of marginal structures, their anatomy and the terminology describing them is poorly delimited. Consequently, homologies of the components of the marginal structures are poorly understood and taxonomies that depend on the presence, absence, or particular manifestation of marginal structures are confused. I review and synthesize anatomical descriptions of the marginal structures and find that they consist of two parts: a projection of the column and a holotrich-dense pad (= acrorhagus) that is histologically differentiated from the surrounding tissues. Although acrorhagi are functionally similar to the catch tentacles of some Actiniaria and to the capitate tentacles of Corallimorpharia and Scleractinia, as structures of the column, acrorhagi are not homologous to them.

N2  - ‘Marconia’ hamiltoni s.l. is known from two discrete mountainous areas in Malawi, i.e. the (southern) Mt. Mulanje complex, and the (more northern) Zomba Plateau s.l. These uplands are separated by about 65 km of lower lying land with different types of vegetation and climate. Material from these two regions may be distinguished as separate species, the southern populations having comparatively small and broad shells with some apertural dentition (‘M’. hamiltoni, lectotype designated), while the northern populations have noticeably larger and more slender shells with a more reduced apertural dentition (‘M’. malavensis). Discussion of the type localities for both taxa shows that these are either localized in an unlikely place (‘M’. hamiltoni) or unclear (‘M’. malavensis). Radula and genital anatomy of ‘M’. hamiltoni are described and depicted for the first time. Both species are ovoviviparous, a rarely reported phenomenon in the Streptaxidae. The genitalia are markedly different from what is known in various streptaxid genera with which these species may be or have been classified. In spite of the confused streptaxid taxonomy, a new genus, Austromarconia, is introduced with Ennea hamiltoni as type species.

N2  - A list of 46 species of Alcyonacea is presented for the coral reefs of the Segundas Archipelago and northwards in Mozambique, as well as a zoogeographical record for the Bazaruto Archipelago in southern Mozambique. Among the 12 genera listed, Rhytisma, Lemnalia and Briareum were recorded on Mozambican reefs for the first time and the study yielded 27 new zoogeographical records. The survey brings the number of soft coral species listed for Mozambique to a total of 53. A latitudinal pattern in soft coral diversity along the south equatorial East African coast is presented, with 46 species recorded in Tanzania, 46 along the northern coast of Mozambique, dropping to 29 in the Bazaruto Archipelago in southern Mozambique and rising again to 38 along the KwaZulu-Natal coast in South Africa. Only Indo-Pacific genera occur in Mozambique with no intrusion of any endemic South African soft coral fauna. Species of the family Alcyoniidae have a wider latitudinal distribution on south equatorial reefs than zooxanthellate members of the families Nephtheidae and Xeniidae, both of which are confined to lower latitudes.

N2  - The oral disc of an actinodendronid sea anemone is drawn out into a variable number of highly branched tentacular structures that make the anemone resemble a tree. These tentacular structures have been considered either lobes or branched tentacles. The term lobe has been applied to various structures of the oral disc in sea anemones; I distinguish between temporary lobes, permanent marginal lobes, and permanent tentacular lobes. I use the number of mesenterial pairs involved in a tentacular structure as evidence that tentacular structures in Actinodendronidae should be considered tentacles, not lobes. According to this interpretation, actinodendronids have only one tentacle communicating with each intermesenterial space, both endocoels and exocoels. The similarity between tentacular structures in members of Actinodendronidae and Thalassianthidae is only superficial; the tentacular structures in these families are not homologues as they have been previously considered.

The new taxon has dimorphic polyps and a similar morphology to some of the flat, lobe-less nominal species of Lobophytum. The new taxon is clearly distinguished, however, by the possession of large, heavily armed autozooids, polypary surface sclerites in the form of large spindles that protrude through the surface, extremely large interior sclerites and base surface sclerites in the form of rods, spindles and ovals.

N2  - Jacobus Cornelis den Hartog was born on 17 April 1942 in Broek op Langedijk. He read biology at Leiden University from 1963 to 1970. He worked at the Caribbean Marine Biological Station on Curaçao from 1971 to 1973, where he studied Caribbean sea anemones. From 1973 he worked in the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden, where he became curator of Coelenterata in 1975. For 25 years he was an active member of the marine research group of the museum and as such he participated in 15 expeditions and was involved in several smaller fieldwork projects, in the Atlantic Ocean as well as in the Indo-W Pacific region. The taxonomy of sea anemones, Actiniaria as well as Ceriantharia and Corallimorpharia, were the main subject of his studies. However, he was a real naturalist and took an interest in several other subjects and groups. As such he published, e.g., on different types of associations, the food of sea turtles and birds, sea birds in particular. He produced several lavishly illustrated papers for the general public. In recent years Den Hartog became a devoted editor of the (serial) publications of the museum. A list of his scientific papers is attached to this paper. He passed away on 7 October 2000.

N2  - When Lady Sophia Raffles published her biography of her late husband, Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, in 1830, she included a catalogue of zoological specimens based on the collections brought back by Raffles from Java and Sumatra. However, the catalogue was included without indication of its authorship. In the case of the birds, it has been attributed to either Vigors alone or Vigors & Horsfield. For about a century names were credited to Vigors alone but this was changed to Vigors & Horsfield. Here reasons are given to revert to Vigors alone. Nine new names were introduced in the catalogue; four are in current use.

N2  - McClelland brought back specimens and drawings from a survey in 1835-36 (and perhaps 1836-37). New birds were described in a paper read by Horsfield (1840). A comparison of the McClelland drawings of birds, held at the British Library, with the type specimens of birds newly named in 1840 and with other material has shown that McClelland’s collection was not fully reported. McClelland actually recorded about 170 species not just 96 as then listed. Some birds listed in 1840 were misidentified, of these some have been corrected earlier but at least one is here newly considered and looks as if it needs further correction. Taxonomic and nomenclatural notes are included when necessary. The correct name to apply to the one species in the genus Melanochlora, the Sultan Tit, is not safely established but as dating is not proven the name in present usage is maintained for the sake of stability. In Appendix 3 a neotype is designated for Tesia olivea (McClelland, 1840).

Revision of species-limits within C. cochinchinensis (Gmelin, 1789) and C. aurifrons (Temminck, 1829) as defined in Delacour (1960) restores three ultra-taxa to species rank, boosting the global list of leafbird species to 11. Certain range and nomenclatural issues are resolved, including re-designation of the type locality of Turdus cochinchinensis, type species of Chloropsis. A new subspecies name is introduced as an outcome.

D. aeruginosum Bourns & Worcester, 1894 is merged into D. agile (Tickell, 1833). The genus Chalcoparia Cabanis, 1851, is re-established for (Motacilla) singalensis Gmelin, 1788. The taxon Leptocoma sperata marinduquensis (duPont, 1971), is shown to be based on a specimen of Aethopyga siparaja magnifica Sharpe, 1876. Aethopyga vigorsii (Sykes, 1832) is split from A. siparaja (Raffles, 1822). Cheke & Mann (op. cit.) mistakenly omitted two forms, Anthreptes malacensis erixanthus Oberholser, 1932 and Arachnothera longirostra zarhina Oberholser, 1912. Five subspecies are removed from Aethopyga shelleyi Sharpe, 1876 to create the polytypic A. bella, Tweeddale, 1877. The Arachnothera affinis (Horsfield, 1822)/modesta (Eyton, 1839)/everetti (Sharpe, 1893) complex is re-evaluated in the light of the revision by Davison in Smythies (1999).

N2  - John Gould’s “A Century of Birds from the Himalaya Mountains” (1830-1833), one of the first works to illustrate birds from the Indian subcontinent, has had a confused publication history. New information in Gould’s correspondence and contemporary reviews has enabled the timing of publication of the separate parts to be determined. Gould’s work was intended to illustrate new birds described in a series of six papers by Nicholas Vigors in the “Proceedings of the Committee of Science and Correspondence of the Zoological Society of London” (1831-1832). Although Vigors’s papers are usually accepted as the source of the 73 new names, 26 were first published in Gould’s work.

N2  - We conclude that the reasons hitherto given for non-recognition of the generic name Ixos in the family Pycnonotidae were erroneous. The broad genus employed by the proponents of that view is now considered too broad, and we concur with Sibley & Monroe (1990) that several generic names must be used, including Ixos. No genus can be constructed except around the name of its type species, and no other species within such a genus may be the type species of a generic name that is older. The arrangement offered by Sibley & Monroe (1990) was flawed because this rule was not observed. We therefore offer a complete revision. We believe it to be desirable to recognise several more genera than those recognised by Sibley & Monroe (1990), at least until we have the molecular evidence available to make firmer judgements.

N2  - The genera of the family Stephanidae Leach, 1815 (Hymenoptera: Stephanoidea), are redefined and keyed. Three new genera and two subgenera are described and illustrated. Profoenatus gen. nov. (type species: Stephanus elliotti Ceballos, 1926, from Madagascar), with subgenus Comnatopus nov. (type species: Stephanus comma Morley, 1917, from the African continent), Afromegischus gen. nov. (type species: Stephanus pachylomerus Schletterer, 1889, from the African continent) and Pseudomegischus gen. nov. (type species: Stephanus sulcifrons Schletterer, 1889), with the nominate subgenus in the Indo-Australian region and subgenus Callomegischus nov. (type species: Stephanus tibiator Schletterer, 1889) in the Afrotropical region with an extension to the Arabian Peninsula.   The Indo-Australian and Palaearctic species of the genus Megischus Brullé, 1846, are revised, 25 described species are recognised as valid, 22 new synonyms are established (plus 5 likely ones) and 17 new species are added. In addition the species of the genera Pseudomegischus gen. nov. and Stephanus Jurine (in Panzer), 1801, are keyed, including two new species: Pseudomegischus celebensis spec. nov. from Central Sulawesi, and Stephanus soror spec. nov. from West Malaysia.   The following new synonyms are established: Stephanus brevicoxis Elliott, 1926, and S. linearis Elliott, 1927 with Megischus curtus (Elliott, 1926); Stephanus tinctipennis Kieffer, 1916, S. pilosus Elliott, 1921, S. rugosus Elliott, 1921, S. impressus Elliott, 1926, S. sulcatus Elliott, 1926, S. philippinensis Ceballos, 1926, S. similis Elliott, 1927, S. ruber Elliott, 1927, S. samaris Elliott, 1927, and S. glabricoxis Elliott, 1927, with Megischus insularis Smith, 1857; Stephanus aequalis Elliott, 1927, S. aequalis var. ruficauda Elliott, 1927, and S. petiolatus Elliott, 1927, with Megischus rubripes (Kieffer, 1916) comb. nov.; Stephanus ceylonicus Cameron, 1903, with Megischus nigricans Sichel, 1866; Stephanus hirsutus Elliott, 1927, and S. punctatus Elliott, 1927 with Megischus nigripes (Elliott, 1927); Stephanus panayanus Elliott, 1927, with Megischus reticulatus (Elliott, 1926); Megischus froggattii Cameron, 1911, and Stephanus rubripes Morley, 1917, with Megischus rufofemoratus (Szépligeti, 1902) comb. nov.; Stephanus hornianus Enderlein, 1912, with Megischus tortus (Morley, 1917); Stephanus quadraticollis Elliott, 1927, and Stephanus elegans Elliott, 1927, with Stephanus sulcifrons Schletterer, 1889. The following are new combinations: Megischus curtus (Elliott, 1926); M. lucidus (Szépligeti, 1902); M. rufofemoratus (Szépligeti, 1902); M. rufus (Elliott, 1927); M. tortus (Morley, 1917), M. rubripes (Kieffer, 1916), Parastephanellus spoliator (Smith, 1863), Pseudomegischus insidiator (Smith, 1863) and P. rugipleurae (Elliott, 1928). Megischus lucidus (Szépligeti, 1902), M. rubripes (Kieffer, 1916) and M. nigripes (Elliott, 1927) are re-instated names.   Lectotypes are designated to enhance the future stability of the taxonomy of the following taxa: Stephanus aequalis Elliott, 1927; Stephanus tinctipennis var. atriceps Kieffer, 1916; Stephanus curtus Elliott, 1926; Megischus froggattii Cameron, 1911; Megischus insularis Smith, 1857; Megischus longicaudatus Costa, 1866; Stephanus lucidus Szépligeti, 1902; Stephanus petiolatus Elliott, 1927; Stephanus reticulatus Elliott, 1926; Stephanus ruber Elliott, 1927; Stephanus tinctipennis var. rubripes Kieffer, 1916; Megischus ruficeps de Saussure, 1901; Stephanus samaris Elliott, 1927; Stephanus similis Elliott, 1927; Stephanus sulcatus Elliott, 1926 and Stephanus variantius Elliott, 1926. Stenophasmidae Benoit, 1949, is a new junior synonym of the tribe Sphathiini Foerster, 1862, of the subfamily Doryctinae Foerster, 1862 (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). The genus Stenophasmus Smith, 1859, is re-instated as a valid genus near the genus Spathius Nees, 1818.

N2  - Species of the genus Pontonia Latreille, 1829, are distributed in tropical and subtropical waters around the world, living in association with either molluscan or ascidian hosts. In the present taxonomic revision, Pontonia sensu lato is divided into six genera: Pontonia sensu stricto; Ascidonia gen. nov., Rostronia gen. nov., Dactylonia gen. nov., Odontonia gen. nov., and Bruceonia gen. nov. A total of 29 species is described and figured, four of which are new to science: Pontonia pilosa spec. nov., Dactylonia holthuisi spec. nov., Odontonia rufopunctata spec. nov., and O. seychellensis spec. nov. The division in six genera is based on a stepwise phylogenetic analysis using morphological characters, performed using PAUP and McClade software. The hypothesized phylogeny is used to analyse the historical biogeography of the shrimps. A deductive method using Brooks Parsimony Analysis (BPA) is performed with regards to the Atlantic and East Pacific areas. The distribution patterns in the Indo-West Pacific are tested against the three scenario’s explaining the ‘East Indies Triangle of maximum diversity’. The historical ecology of the shrimps is analysed using their hypothesized phylogeny. In analogy with the historical biogeographical analyais, a deductive BPA method was applied, measuring the fit of the shrimp phylogeny on the hypothesized host phylogeny at different taxonomical levels of the hosts.

N2  - The taxonomy of the jungle babblers, Delacour’s tribe Pellorneini, has long been subject to reversals of opinion, suggestive of a still-poor understanding of natural relationships. At the unstable boundary of genera Trichastoma and Pellorneum, groups of taxa usually taken to comprise a continental species tickelli and an insular species pyrrogenys have shifted from positions in separate genera to being neighbours in first one and then the other of these two. A fresh morphological analysis and newly described vocalizations show them to be one another’s probable closest relative, potentially conspecific but due to limitations on the allowable use of vocalization evidence among allopatric populations, for the time being at least, kept as separate entities. The Sumatran taxon buettikoferi, long held to be a subspecies of one or other of these two, has unique songs and a sufficient array of other peculiarities to be treated unequivocally as a full species, perhaps not more closely related than as sister species to the whole of the rest of the cluster.

In most cases selected types, which are not necessarily lectotypes, have been listed by Warren (1966) or Warren & Harrison (1971), but we provide here information that has come to light during preparatory work on a list of types of all Japanese taxa. We have located types for a number of taxa for which they had not been identified or segregated, and lectotypes are here designated for three taxa to safeguard current nomenclatural practice.

N2  - Further research into the type of Pitta baudii Müller & Schlegel, 1839, showed that Dickinson et al. (2000) erred in referring to the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden as the collection where a type specimen of this taxon is kept. The correction of the date of description to 1839 has revealed that the four selected specimens cannot be types. The museum received them too late. The confusion has been traced to one of the four being labelled “type”. This we find refers to the illustration by J. Wolf published in June 1845. The 1839 plate was suppressed and the original type relative to this taxon as illustrated therein has not been traced; a depiction of this is therefore of considerable importance. The suppressed plate has been located and is reproduced here.

N2  - A copy of the reported 1850 impression of the “Nouveau recueil de planches coloriées” that has recently come to light suggests that bound copies would be virtually indistinguishable from the first edition (1820-1839) despite the different publisher. In spite of clear statements by the publisher, we believe there must be doubts whether any part of such an edition, other than the wrappers, was specially reprinted. The wrappers found with this copy confirm that during the appearance of the first edition generic wrappers were created, which did not have details of the contents on the back.

N2  - The “Nouveau recueil de planches coloriées” of Temminck & Laugier (1820-1839) contains many descriptions of new birds and is of fundamental importance to the history of ornithology. A new detailed review of the evidence presented by the book itself has brought clarity to the relationships between the plates and the livraisons2 of which they were a part. The opportunity has been taken to provide a fresh list of dates for the livraisons, this contains minor changes to that of Zimmer (1926) and the earlier, more widely known one of Sherborn (1898). After this study reached its conclusions important new information has come to light, which confirms the main findings. The second part of this paper reviews specific cases investigated. These relate to Asian taxa. There is every probability that similar cases will be found in the context of some names given to birds from other regions. Various appendices provide details to assist future workers, who will now want to assess the dates used in their regions, and one appendix summarises changes needed based on this work.

Sampling of the slopes of 14 seamounts was undertaken in 1997 by the Australian Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). The collection yielded 14 species of hydroids, six of which are new, including two species of a new genus. Only Halecium fragile Hodgson, 1950, and Tripoma arboreum Hirohito, 1995, have previously been recorded from Tasmania. Other species are known from deep water off New Zealand, Japan and the south-western Atlantic.

Around 13 islands transects at the exposed and leeward slope were sampled. Apart from parameters like substrate type, hydrodynamic energy and light intensity (directly related to depth) also nutrient availability and environmental stabiltity determine the distribution over the shelf. Some of the species, and especially the calcarinids, are less specialised to some of these parameters than in other areas. Elphidium craticulatum, showing chloroplast husbandry, is an important fauna component.

N2  - Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world (1.8 million km2 of land, 3.1 million km2 of sea, plus a 200 miles Exclusive Economic Zone covering some 2.7 million km2). Its population, ranking number four on the world list, amounts to more than 216 million people. Marine related programmes are given a high priority in Indonesia. During the last two decades the government has carried out a concerted effort in marine capacity building through bilateral, regional and international co-operation. This effort included increasing man-power development, expanding and improving research facilities, establishing a national marine data centre, improving co-operation within the Indonesian marine science community, and international co-operation. The bilateral agreement with The Netherlands for the implementation of the Snellius II Programme (1982-1987) laid the intellectual basis for the Indonesian marine science capability. The necessary research vessels were obtained through bilateral cooperation with France and Norway. At present Indonesia operates: (1) a network of tide gauges and current meter stations, (2) two satellite ground stations, (3) tropical radar wind profiling stations, (4) a network of marine pollution stations, (5) eight ocean-going, coastal and fisheries research vessels, and (6) twelve Seawatch monitoring buoys. The present commitment to maritime affairs is reflected in the establishment of a new Ministry for Maritime Exploration and Fisheries in which are brought together at a policy making and co-ordinating level, most aspects of sustainable use of Indonesia’s ocean space. It is expected that, in the near future, Indonesia will play a major role in marine affairs in the western Pacific region. This paper provides a review of Indonesian experience in developing a national marine capability and the catalysing role of the Snellius II Programme in this.

N2  - This contribution is an attempt to sketch the life and works of Dr Jacob van der Land, curator of worms and chief marine biologist of the National Museum of Natural History, on the occasion of his official retirement. Born in 1935, Jacob van der Land read biology at Leiden University (1958-1964), where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1970 on a treatise on the Priapulida under the supervision of Prof. Dr L.D. Brongersma. In 1964 he was appointed curator of worms in the museum. Later on he took over leadership of the invertebrate section (excluding insects) of the museum and was also placed in charge of all marine research. Initially, Van der Land organized field trips for biology students of Leiden University to Scandinavia, who were able to sample seagoing studies from a research vessel. From the early seventies on he conducted a number of smaller and larger marine expeditions mainly in the tropics (particularly in SE. Asia). His talent for organisation, management and leadership in the field was outstanding and led to the complete success of these undertakings. In an interim period in the museum’s history he also participated in the general management. Subsequently his talents were severely tested when in 1996-1998 he was asked to supervise the almost traumatic move of the museum from the old premises in the Raamsteeg to the purpose- built new complex in the Darwinweg elsewhere in Leiden. Apart from having made a significant impact on the study of various groups of worms and worm-like animals (Turbellaria, Priapulida, Oligochaeta, Tardigrada, Vestimentifera), Van der Land also greatly influenced marine research in the Netherlands by participating in scientific management on a national scale. A list of his publications until early 2000 is attached.

In addition to the descriptions, synonymy, variability and geographical distribution are discussed; autoecological data and measurements are also presented. The new species described here are: Aglaophenia svobodai spec. nov., Streptocaulus caboverdensis spec. nov., S. chonae spec. nov., Antennella confusa spec. nov. and Nemertesia anonyma spec. nov. All species are figured. The general classification used follows Bouillon (1985, 1995); nomenclature on the species level is as used by Svoboda & Cornelius (1991), Ramil & Vervoort (1992a, 1992b), Calder (1997) and Schuchert (1997). The material originates from the seas and coasts around the Azores, Madeira, Selvagens, Canary Islands and Cape Verde Islands, as well as the Atlantic off Morocco and Mauritania, at depths varying between 0 and 4000 m. All species discussed have a wider, usually Atlantic distribution, with the exception of Streptocaulus pulcherrimus Allman, 1883, endemic in the Cape Verde area and Nemertesia belini Bedot, 1916, known only from the Azores and Cape Verde Islands.

N2  - Any exploration of the development of our knowledge of the distribution and nomenclature of the black-naped oriole produces a bewildering complex of names. It is the more complex because the origin of the specimen named Oriolus chinensis Linnaeus, 1766, was disputed. When it was proposed that the origin might be the Philippines this at first seemed to affect the nomenclature in India but not China. A new name then introduced proved to be preoccupied by one that rested on a description that seemed too flawed to be applicable. When it was finally determined that the Chinese breeding population needed a new name, and that this was the form that reached eastern parts of India as a migrant, the name changes proposed met such resistance that for nearly 60 years the names in use, in one or more parts of the range of the species, awaited correction. Today, correctly, the name chinensis is applied as the trinomial of the resident Philippine population and the name diffusus Sharpe, 1877, to breeding Chinese birds which are migratory and just include easternmost India in their winter range.

N2  - There has been some confusion over whether the name Oriolus steerii Sharpe, 1877, should be attached to the population of Basilan or the population of Negros of the Philippine oriole. Two separate descriptions appeared (Sharpe, 1877 a, b) and differed. A decision on which was the prior description was taken by Dickinson et al. (1991) and a fresh review of the facts shows that they were incorrect in selecting Basilan as the type locality of the nominate form. That decision was in contradiction to the approach taken by Greenway in Mayr & Greenway (1962). As there, the name must be assigned to the population of Negros. As a result, the population of Basilan must be called O. s. basilanicus Ogilvie- Grant, 1896, or if a broader species-concept is preferred O. xanthonotus basilanicus Ogilvie-Grant, 1896. The name nigrostriatus Bourns & Worcester, 1894, returns to the synonymy of nominate steerii. The specimen in Tring is designated as the lectotype of steerii Sharpe, 1877, because the Michigan specimen, from Isabela de Basilan, is not representative of the nominate population of steerii.

N2  - The bush-warbler Bradypterus mandelli (Brooks, 1875) was described from Sikkim, and numerous specimens from India were identified with it, but it was synonymised with the brown bush-warbler Bradypterus luteoventris (Hodgson, 1845) in 1881. In 1952, east Asian populations were grouped under the name of the Luzon form of the russet bush-warbler, Bradypterus seebohmi (Ogilvie-Grant, 1895). This taxonomy, however, failed to associate the Indian form and its available name mandelli, which received limited usage until 1919, with seebohmi, a matter reviewed and corrected herein. Specimens prove that mandelli has long been known from India, Bhutan, and Myanmar (Burma). The Thai population, previously placed in idoneus (Riley, 1940), belongs instead with the nominate race mandelli. The eastern Chinese race melanorhynchus (Rickett, 1898) is valid but not very distinctive. The nominate race probably occurs in Laos and northern Vietnam. Vocalisations are stereotyped, being extremely similar across Asia from north-eastern India to eastern China. The name idoneus is herein restricted to the southern Vietnamese population, as this race is evidently somewhat distinct vocally and morphologically. The common name ‘russet bush-warbler’ should continue to be used only for Bradypterus mandelli of mainland Asia. The Luzon form seebohmi was known only from the type specimen, other 20th century reports having been erroneous, until it was rediscovered in February 2000 near the type locality. Its song, while recognisably similar to that of mandelli, has several consistent structural differences, and we tentatively reallocate to it species rank as the ‘Benguet bush-warbler’ B. seebohmi. Both Javan and Timorese forms are morphologically distinct, and are provisionally treated as separate species, the ‘Javan bush-warbler’ B. montis (Hartert, 1896) and the ‘Timor bush-warbler’ B. timorensis (Mayr, 1944). A form on Bali for which no specimen material is available is evidently somewhat different vocally from B. montis. We address the issues of the synonymy of all potentially relevant names older than mandelli; the priority of the name Horornis flaviventris, Hodgson, 1845 over B. t. thoracicus (Blyth, 1845), of which the latter nevertheless takes precedence; and the designation of a lectotype for Cettia russula Slater, 1897, because the type series includes one mandelli. Reassessment of the range and taxonomy of luteoventris showed that its occurrence in Nepal, Laos, and Thailand is unproven, and that it is probably monotypic.

All 18 species are restricted to the northern, granitic islands. This paper describes 15 species, including two new genera (Silhouettia and Careoradula), and four new subspecies (Edentulina dussumieri reservae, E. d. silhouettae, E. d. praslina, Stereostele nevilli parvidentata). The nominal taxon Streptaxis (Imperturbatia) constans var. silhouettae is raised to species level to become the type species of the new genus Silhouettia. The type species of Careoradula is Streptaxis (Imperturbatia) perelegans. Anatomical descriptions and figures are provided for 13 species; the new genus Careoradula is distinct from all other streptaxids by the complete absence of a radula and associated structures. Distribution is featured on individual maps for each species. The paper concludes with a key to the shells of all species, those of Priodiscus included, and some preliminary considerations on the distribution of this group in the Seychelles archipelago.

Thus, the ten projects proposed here are not directly conservation-orientated. Rather, they are aimed at elucidating aspects and issues that are needed for a more complete understanding of these remarkable birds. In particular, a plea is made for high quality natural history and for cultural sensitivity and awareness.

N2  - Together with land clearance, grazing by stock and inappropriate fire regimes, predation by the introduced European red fox Vulpes vulpes (Linnaeus, 1758) has decimated populations of malleefowl Leipoa ocellata Gould, 1840. The decline of the malleefowl has been most pronounced in New South Wales, where foxes prey so heavily on malleefowl that adult mortality exceeds recruitment of young into the breeding population. Although young malleefowl are particularly vulnerable to foxes, subadults and adults are also taken. Within New South Wales, heavy predation by foxes occurs both in the remnants of native vegetation within agricultural lands and in the large tracts of mallee that lie further inland. Foxes appear to be the prime cause of malleefowl mortality throughout much of the malleefowl’s geographic range. Both fire and grazing by domestic stock reduce the carrying capacity of the habitat for malleefowl. In reserves where stock are excluded, there is no evidence that food resources are limiting malleefowl populations. Exotic herbivores, such as goats and rabbits, probably contribute to the demise of the malleefowl by reducing vegetative cover. Malleefowl are particularly vulnerable to predation by raptors in habitats where vegetative cover is sparse. Greater canopy cover, together with greater stocks of seeds within the soil seed-bank, can explain why old-growth mallee is optimal habitat for malleefowl. Malleefowl survival can be enhanced substantially by fox control. Fox baiting, however, needs to be frequent, intensive and widespread to reduce fox density to levels where predation no longer threatens the survival or recovery of malleefowl populations. Poisoning of foxes on surrounding properties, together with effective rabbit and goat control, is needed to maximise the effectiveness of any fox-control program. Without conservation action, the steady decline and loss of extant populations will continue unabated. Improved survival of malleefowl in habitat that has been intensively managed for their benefit is encouraging, but as yet there has been no definitive evidence of population recovery. In New South Wales, conservation efforts will need to focus on the expansive reserves of mallee in the west of the state. Conservation of malleefowl throughout its range is likely to be achieved only by the use of exclusion fencing to protect isolated populations in small remnants of native vegetation.

N2  - The malleefowl Leipoa ocellata Gould, 1840, has declined substantially since European settlement of Australia just over 200 years ago. The species is now vulnerable and is threatened by the loss and degradation of suitable habitat by grazing, fire, and clearing, by the insidious effects of fragmentation of their populations that has resulted from clearing, and by predation by introduced foxes. Accordingly, a National Malleefowl Recovery Plan is being prepared to outline actions that are needed to both secure the species and provide the information necessary for effective management. Conserving malleefowl will require improved management throughout its range and on a diversity of land tenures. Improving habitat quality is crucial and may be achieved by reducing grazing pressure from commercial stock and feral goats, by preventing the catastrophic effects of large wildfire, and by reducing the size and frequency of intentional fires. Reducing the abundance of foxes may also assist malleefowl recovery, particularly where the birds’ populations are small and isolated or declining. Remaining malleefowl populations are highly fragmented, and there is a need in many areas for habitat links to facilitate dispersal of the species between nearby habitat patches. The retention and revegetation of habitat links would also slow the degradation of remnant habitats due to increasing soil salinity.   Considering the vulnerability of the species, it is especially important to monitor the distribution and abundance of malleefowl across Australia and over a number of years. Effective conservation will also require a better understanding of the species’ population dynamics, habitat preferences and genetic variability.   Local communities have made a major contribution to protecting and understanding the malleefowl and interest in this popular species is growing rapidly. Many of the projects outlined in the Recovery Plan are suitable for community involvement, and the time is ripe to further encourage and promote this interest in malleefowl conservation.

N2  - Parks Victoria and the Department of Natural Resources & Environment (NRE) are collaborating with agencies from the other States and the Commonwealth of Australia in a national program of detailed monitoring and surveillance of the effects of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD). A component of the Victorian study involves an investigation of possible changes in fox predation upon malleefowl Leipoa ocellata Gould, 1840, in the wake of reduced rabbit abundance caused by RCD. The study entails measurement of overall fox activity post-RCD, measurement of egg loss from malleefowl nests, and an assessment of any observable changes in fox diet. Measures of fox abundance/activity pre- and post- RCD suggest that the level of fox activity has not declined significantly in the 18 months since the spread of RCD in the Victorian Mallee. This contrasts with a dramatic decline in rabbit abundance giving rise to concerns about the possibility of “prey switching”. Preliminary findings by Benshemesh & Burton (1997) are that there was a high level of egg loss due to foxes in the first breeding season post-RCD (1996/97). The only similar finding was by Frith (1959) in a study conducted from 1953/54 to 1957/58 at the time when myxomatosis first affected rabbit populations in Australia. Initial sampling indicates that rabbits formed a relatively small proportion of the fox diet (approximately 15% of stomach contents) at the time of the initial RCD epizootic. It is too early to draw conclusions regarding any changes in fox diet post-RCD.

Microbial decomposition of organic matter in mounds is likely to be the major source of heat production within incubation mounds of the Nicobar megapode, though a direct relation between the rate of organic activity and the temperature could not be shown. The size of a mound was found to be the most important factor in the stabilization of incubation temperatures at optimal levels. Data on the social organization of the Nicobar megapode are presented. The use of mounds by multiple pairs, territorial behaviour, extrapair copulations and the break-up of pairs are highlighted. The mating system in the Nicobar megapode is briefly discussed.

N2  - The megapode hatchling receives no care or guidance from its parents and so must be able to survive by itself. This raises some basic questions about the innate abilities of megapode hatchlings, including the possibility of predator recognition. Experiments were conducted to investigate the visual predator recognition abilities of the hatchlings of the Australian brush-turkey Alectura lathami J.E. Gray, 1831. Two separate methods involving video images and actual stimuli were used. There were no significant differences between the behaviours observed before compared to after the presentation of each stimulus, whether it was predator or non-predator, moving or non-moving. The hatchlings did not respond with any escape or avoidance behaviours when presented with predator stimuli. Although there are a number of potential explanations for these results, it is most likely that the responses observed were genuine, indicating that brush-turkey hatchlings do not instinctively flee in response to the visual presence or movement of a predator. In the wild, they may adopt the strategy of freezing, as do hatchlings of the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata Gould, 1840. However, high mortality rates indicate this strategy is not very successful and their survival to sub-adult stage may be largely dependent on chance.

The majority of the world’s Moluccan megapode population rely on only two nesting grounds on the islands of Halmahera and Haruku, Indonesia. An understanding of the ecological characteristics of these breeding sites is thus important in terms of conservation. Studies of the largest of the two nesting grounds in Halmahera have shown specific temporal and spatial patterns of egg laying. In this paper I discuss the adaptive significance and conservation implications of these laying patterns.

N2  - The acoustic communication of the Polynesian megapode Megapodius pritchardii G.R. Gray, 1864, was studied and analysed for the first time. Adults pair up monogamously and the male produces so called whistles while guarding its mate. The three-element song of the male together with the females`s “coo” call are combined to produce a duet. Depending on the social context, either sex may initiate the duet. Both male song and duet serve mainly in territorial defence. Neighbouring pairs often answer by producing the same sound in response to any one of three vocalizations (song, duet, whistle). “Clucks” are additional sounds with a social function uttered by both sexes. When handled, adults and chicks utter “distress calls”; in chicks, these are the only sounds recorded. Other Megapodius species seem to have a similar sound-repertoire as the Polynesian megapode.

N2  - Inter- and intrafamilial relationships among the Megapodiidae are presented and discussed based on their host-specific chewing louse fauna, in particular the Goniodidae (Ischnocera). Use is made of both empirical evidence and statistical methods. So far, 53 species of chewing lice have been described which are found only on megapodes, a number which is still growing. The relationships among the Goniodidae genera on megapodes have been analysed using Wagner parsimony analysis rooted by character polarity (51 morphological features). Based on their chewing lice, the Megapodiidae seem to be more closely related to the Phasianidae than to the Cracidae. Megapodes share no Ischnocera with the cracids, while they share a single genus Goniocotes Burmeister, 1838 (one species only, on Macrocephalon maleo S. Müller, 1846) with the Phasianidae. The distribution of 18 Ischnocera genera support the following intrafamilial division: Alectura Latham, 1824, and Aepypodius Oustalet, 1880, on the one hand and Megapodius Gaimard, 1823, and Eulipoa Ogilvie-Grant, 1893, on the other form respective sister groups. The relationships between Leipoa Gould, 1840, Talegalla Lesson, 1828, and Macrocephalon S. Müller, 1846, remain unclear.

N2  - The arrival of prehistoric peoples in Oceania over the past several millennia resulted in the extinction of many species and populations of megapodes. Before these anthropogenic losses, species of megapodes ranged across Melanesia, Western Polynesia, and much of Micronesia. Island groups that lack megapodes today but were inhabited by them in the past include New Caledonia, Fiji, the Ha`apai Group and `Eua (Tonga), Samoa, Niue, and Pohnpei. The extinct megapodes varied in size from a tiny, quail-like species of Megapodius in Tonga to the large, flightless Sylviornis of New Caledonia. Remote Tongan islands as small as 13 km2 were able to sustain three species of Megapodius before human impact, thus calling into question the validity of using modern species assemblages to understand the function of natural communities.

N2  - Two species of sea anemones with a conspicuous marginal ruff of frond-like structures encompassing the tentacular crown occur on the Chilean coast. Oulactis concinnata (= Isoulactis chilensis) (Drayton in Dana, 1846) is re-described in detail and further information is provided for Oulactis coliumensis (Riemann- Zürneck & Gallardo, 1990) (= Saccactis coliumensis) (both Actiniidae). The distribution of O. concinnata from Playa Las Salinas, Perú (9°19’10’’S, 78°26’30’’W), to the region of Valdivia, Chile (39°47’S, 73°21’W), lies within a zoogeographical unit known as the Peruvian Province. Re-description of O. concinnata is based on examination of 10 specimens collected between 1975 and 2003, and on observations of about 50 living anemones in their habitat and in aquaria. Specimens of this species occur in the intertidal zone and to depths of 15 m in crevices filled with sand, broken shells or pebbles. The most distinctive and conspicuous features of O. concinnata are its large size, the lobed and often colourful oral disc and the column with adhesive verrucae. Towards the margin these become smaller and compound and, on the upper margin, form the ruff of frond-like papillae. The structure of the marginal ruff is described in detail and its possible function is considered. The hypothesis is presented that the frond-like structures of the ruff are derived from verrucae. Oulactis concinnata is unusual in possessing special fighting tentacles with batteries of large basitrichs but lacking holotrichs. The genera Isoulactis Carlgren, 1959, Isocradactis Carlgren, 1924, and Saccactis Lager, 1911, are synonymized with the genus Oulactis Milne Edwards & Haime, 1851. The diagnoses of two other genera with a marginal ruff, Actinostella Duchassaing, 1850, and Onubactis López-González, den Hartog & García-Gómez, 1995, are provided. The diagnoses of the genera Oulactis and Actinostella are amended, their distinguishing features and cnidae compared and the described species listed.     A lo largo de la costa chilena se distribuyen dos especies de anémonas de mar con un collar vistoso de estructuras papilosas que rodean a la corona de tentáculos. Oulactis concinnata (= Isoulactis chilensis) (Drayton in Dana, 1846) (Actiniidae) es re-descrita en detalle. Además se aporta información adicional sobre la especie Oulactis coliumensis (Riemann-Zürneck & Gallardo, 1990) (= Saccactis coliumensis). Oulactis concinnata se distribuye desde Playa Las Salinas, Perú (9°19’10’’S, 78°26’30’’W) hasta la región de Valdivia, Chile (39°47’S, 73°21’W), y se encuentra integrada a la región zoogeográfica conocida como la provincia peruana. La re-descripción de O. concinnata está basada en el examen de 10 especimenes recolectados entre 1975 y 2003, y en observaciones de unas 50 anémonas vivas en su hábitat y en acuario. Los ejemplares de esta especie se distribuyen desde la zona intermareal hasta una profundidad de 15 m, y generalmente se encuentran en grietas llenadas de arena, conchas quebradas y cascajo. Los caracteres más distintivos y vistosos de O. concinnata son: su gran tamaño; su disco oral lobado, el cuál presenta frecuentemente un color intenso; y por último su columna con verrucas adhesivas. Hacia el margen del disco las verrucas se hacen más pequeñas y compuestas y, en el margen superior, forman un collar de papilas llamativas. La estructura del collar marginal esta descrito en detalle y su posible función es discutida. Asimismo también se discute la relación de parentesco evolutivo entre las papilas y las verrugas. Oulactis concinnata se diferencia de otras especies del mismo género por presentar “catch tentacles” que poseen grandes basitricos pero no holotricos. Los géneros Isoulactis Carlgren, 1959, Isocradactis Carlgren, 1924 y Saccactis Lager, 1911 son sinonimizadas con el género Oulactis Milne Edwards & Haime, 1851. Se presenta la diagnosis de dos otros géneros con collar, Actinostella Duchassaing, 1850 y Onubactis López- González, den Hartog & García-Gómez. Se rectifica las diagnosis de los géneros Oulactis y Actinostella y se comparan sus caracteres distintivos ofreciendo además una lista de las especies descritas.

N2  - Names of groups of organisms in the higher categories are being changed rather often, even when there is no need for it. This is allowed because the codes of nomenclature do not apply to group names above the family level. Regrettably this may lead to long periods of confusion. Examples are Coelenterata for which the new name Cnidaria was proposed in 1888 and Madreporaria for which the new name Scleractinia was proposed in 1900. The gradual replacement of the old names by the new names in scientific papers during the last 50 years was analyzed. The name Madreporaria virtually disappeared during this period and the name Coelenterata is now being used in only about 10% of scientific papers and had better be abandoned as well.

N2  - During several cruises carried out by the Ifremer (Institut français de recherche pour l’exploitation de la mer) with the submersile “Nautile” at different hydrothermal sites and cold seeps, an important collection of anthozoans - mainly actiniarians - was sampled. Additional material was collected by an American cruise with the submersile “Alvin”. The goal of the present contribution is to describe part of this actiniarian fauna inhabiting three chemoautotrophic sites, one of them in the Mid-Atlantic Rise and the other two in the Eastern Pacific. A new genus and species of actinostolids is proposed after the study of specimens collected at hydrothermal vents in the Guaymas Basin (East Pacific Rise, Gulf of California, 27º00’N-111º24’W, 2020 m). Furthermore, some specimens collected in cold seeps along the MAT (Middle America Trench, off Mexico, 18º21’-20°01’N 104º21’-106º17’W, 3354-3795 m) are reported as Hadalanthus aff. knudseni. This material is discussed and compared with the existing type material of H. knudseni Carlgren, 1956, and Tealidium jungerseni Carlgren, 1921. In addition, some specimens of Maractis rimicarivora Fautin & Barber, 1999, were collected at hydrothermal vents of the Mid Atlantic Ridge Snake Pit (23º22.9’N-44º55.8’W, 3490 m) site. This species is collected for the first time after its original description at Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG, 26º08’N 44º49.6’W, 3650 m). Some ecological remarks are given from in situ and video observations.

N2  - Pelagic species are widely distributed in a horizontal plane and have three-dimensional distributions, since the sea covers about 70% of the surface of the earth, and on average 4 km deep. For most macrozooplankton and micronekton groups there seems to be no great expectations of finding new taxa with the exception of gelatinous groups and of the deep sea, which is a relatively unknown especially in the benthopelagic zone close to the sea-bed. However, we do not know very much about variation, either morphological or genetical, within socalled species in different parts of their range. We think we are dealing with single very broadly distributed species, which, in reality, are species complexes consisting of several more or less cryptic species or infraspecific categories. Examples are given in different animal phyla of the same phenomena e.g. that we find variation in consistent geographic patterns. The recognition of the true dimensions of the species diversity and variation in the ocean may give us a new view about the so-called speciespoor pelagic system. Much more research is needed before we can have real confidence in our estimates of the numbers of species existing in the pelagic realm.

N2  - The larger benthic foraminifera fauna from four regions at or near Bali are described. In 132 samples in total 19 species were found. This is a similar to species richness in areas like the Spermonde and Cebu, but the fauna composition differed markedly. For each species the occurrence at Bali and environmental parameters affecting this distribution are discussed. It is argued that the very low abundance of imperforate species is not due to the absence of their microhabitat, but due to climatic or oceanographic parameters. The most likely is the presence of periodic upwelling, which causes the seawater temperature to drop to low levels seasonally.

Based on the use of pore characters and overall skeleton growth forms, which are normally used for the classification of Millepora, the present study concludes that six of seven Indo-Pacific species appear to occur in Indonesia, viz., M. dichotoma Forskål, 1775, M. exaesa Forskål, 1775, M. platyphylla Hemprich & Ehrenberg, 1834, M. intricata Milne-Edwards, 1857 (including M. intricata forma murrayi Quelch, 1884), M. tenera Boschma, 1949, and M. boschmai de Weerdt & Glynn, 1991, which so far was considered an East Pacific endemic. Of the 13 species previously reported from the Indo-Pacific, six were synonymized. M. murrayi Quelch, 1884, has been synonymized with M. intricata, which may show two distinct branching patterns, that may occur in separate corals or in a single one. M. latifolia Boschma, 1948, M. tuberosa Boschma, 1966, M. cruzi Nemenzo, 1975, M. xishaensis Zou, 1978, and M. nodulosa Nemenzo, 1984, are also considered synonyms. M. foveolata Crossland, 1952, is a distinct species but it has not been found in Indonesia.

N2  - In March 2000 and November/December 2001 thirteen specimens of Corallimorphus profundus Moseley, 1877, a conspicuous, anemone-like cnidarian, were hand-sampled by SCUBA diving in 30 to 40 m depth off US Palmer Station, Antarctic Peninsula. Corallimorphus species were formerly recorded only from deep water habitats from where they had been brought up more or less damaged, with most of their epithelia lost or macerated. The present well preserved specimens offer the opportunity to study various aspects of the species’ morphology and biology, particularly as one mature female contained a full cycle of oogenesis besides two batches of brooded developmental stages. Most of the results obtained demonstrate that the genus Corallimorphus shows features and bionomics that are typical of the Scleractinia. Thus, Moseley’s early assumption (1877) that this genus is distinguished from certain deep-sea corals such as Stephanophyllia only by the absence of the calcareous skeleton is largely confirmed, although direct comparison with Moseley’s material was not possible here. Similar relationships exist for another corallimorpharian, Nectactis singularis Gravier, 1918. This small, discoidal, soft-bodied deep-sea species resembles the poorly skeletalized deep-sea Scleractinia Leptopenus antarcticus Cairns, 1980, in cnidom data and histological sections.

N2  - Southern African coral communities form a continuum from the more typical, accretive reefs in the tropics of Mozambique to the marginal, southernmost African distribution of this fauna in KwaZulu- Natal. While the latter are limited in size, they are gaining increasing attention as they provide a model for the study of many of the stresses to which these valuable systems are globally being subjected. Soft coral cover, comprising relatively few species, exceeds that of scleractinians over much of the southern reefs, and the coral communities attain a high biodiversity at this latitude on the East African coast. A long-term monitoring programme has revealed small yet significant changes in community structure on the reefs in recent years, concurrent with consistent increases in mean and maximum temperature. Insignificant bleaching was encountered during the 1998 ENSO event, unlike elsewhere in East Africa, but quantifiable bleaching occurred during an extended period of warming in 2000. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) have caused longer-term changes in isolated areas. A study of coral larval dispersal and recruitment has been initiated to establish the capacity of the reefs to recover from the latter form of disturbance. The marginal nature of the reefs is further manifested by corals that generate aseasonal and atypical natural products and have a reproductive pattern that conforms with the pattern found on marginal reefs in western Australia. Calcium deposition on the reefs is also low due to physico-chemical factors that are related to latitude. Published projections on the long-term effects of climate change indicate that more reefs will become marginal as a result of global warming. Current monitoring on the South African reefs is being expanded to investigate the extent to which they will elucidate the future of more typical reefs.

N2  - The common NE Atlantic sponge species hitherto known under the name Prosuberites epiphytum (Lamarck, 1814), is differentiated from the South Australian type and other regional specimens. Spicule size and form, although generally similar, are subtly different. Australian P. epiphytum apparently persistently overgrow the thallus of algae, possibly as part of a symbiotic association, and this is not known for European specimens. In view of these facts and taking into account the disjunct distribution, it is proposed to assign the NE Atlantic populations to a new species. The genus Prosuberites has been restricted recently to species with single long tylostyles with heads embedded in a basal spongin plate, and both P. epiphytum and the new species do not conform to this definition. They are here assigned to Protosuberites Schwartschewsky, 1905. The new species is named Protosuberites denhartogi spec. nov. in honour of J.C. den Hartog.

N2  - A revised classification of the Holarctic genera of Nepticulidae is provided. Eight genera belonging to the nominal subfamily are recognised and redefined. They are Enteucha Meyrick ( = Johanssonia Borkowski, Artaversala Davis, Oligoneura Davis), Stigmella Schrank (including Astigrnella Puplesis), Simplimorpha Scoble in the Nepticulini and Acalyptris Meyrick (= Microcalyptris Braun, Niepeltia Strand), Trifurcula Zeller, Parafomoria Van Nieukerken, Bohemannia Stainton and Ectoedemia Busck in the Trifurculini. Trifurcula is divided into the subgenera Glaucolepis Braun ( = Fedalmia Beirne), Levarchama Beirne and Trifurcula s.str. Ectoedemia is divided into the subgenera Etainia Beirne, Fomoria Beirne, Laqueus Scoble, Zirnmermannia Hering and Ectoedemia s.str. The genera and subgenera are (re)described and data on biology and distribution are given. The species Simplimorpha promissa (Staudinger) and Acalyptris psammophricta Meyrick are redescribed. A phylogeny of the family in cladistic sense is presented and discussed. The monophyly of Ectoedernia is uncertain, and monophyly of the subgenus Fomoria could not be demonstrated. Current opinions about the phylogenetic position of the Nepticulidae and the division of the Heteroneura are reviewed and discussed. The biogeography and hostplant relationships of the family are review

N2  - A revised key to the subfamilies, tribes and subtribes of the Cetoniidae (Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea) is presented. Comments are given on the classification implied by the key, which includes several redefinitions. All the known genera (ca. 510) are listed under their tribe or subtribe, the position of several being different from that in Schenkling's catalogues (1921, 1922). References to recent synoptic literature are given. Eighteen new subtribes are proposed, the majority in the tribe Cremastocheilini. One new tribe is proposed, the Platygeniini. Attention is drawn to various new and neglected synonymies, original spellings, and other nomenclatural matters regarding family-group and genus-group names. The position of many genera is briefly discussed. Some striking features of the biogeography of the Cetoniidae are discussed, such as the high generic endemicity for the major biogeographical regions (for the Madagascan, Afrotropical and Australasian regions ca. 90% or more).
