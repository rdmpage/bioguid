N2  - Because of their economic importance as biological control agents, the basic biology of phytoseiid mites has been studied extensively. Diapause induction has been investigated in a number of species, with consistent results; however, very few studies have addressed cold hardiness of these mites. Recent studies of cold hardiness and cold storage of Phytoseiulus persimilis Athias-Henriot and Amblyseius cucumeris (Oudemans) indicate that cold exposure had greater adverse effects on nondiapausing A. cucumeris, which normally overwinter in diapause, than on P. persimilis, which do not diapause. This might be explained in terms of adaptations for winter survival in their native environments. Phytoseiid mites are easily mass-reared and enter diapause in a facultative manner, and thus may be ideal subjects for investigation of the relationship between cold hardiness and diapause.

N2  - The pharmacological effects of proctolin, [L-Dopa2]-proctolin, [Phe(OMe)2]-proctolin and [Cha(4-OMe)2]-proctolin were studied on pupae of the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor. The results were obtained by prolonged monitoring of extracardiac pulsations in haemocoelic pressure. These pulsations revealed the functions of the autonomic nervous system (coelopulse). The administration of proctolin in 100 nM to 5 µM concentrations increased the amplitude of haemocoelic pressure pulsations up to six-fold, within a few minutes. With dosages corresponding to 1 µM concentrations, the effects of proctolin culminated between the 2nd and 3rd hour post-treatment, with a successive decline to the original level within the next 15–20 hrs. The frequency of pulsations and duration of resting periods were unaffected. The [L-Dopa2]-proctolin analogue was slightly-more effective than proctolin itself, although its action was retarded for 20–30 min. The remaining two proctolin derivatives were completely inactive. Large doses of proctolin or [L-Dopa2]-proctolin (more than 5 µM concentrations in the body) produced pathophysiological symptoms of \'\'hyperproctolinism\'\', manifested by paralysis of all haemocoelic pulsations for several hours. The findings of considerable in vivo persistence of proctolin are in conflict with some general views upon the rapid inactivation of proctolin by enzymes present in the haemolymph or tissues. It is possible that proctolin may be a valid neurohormone, involved in the regulation of homeostatic physiological functions, and this is discussed.

N2  - The levels of progesterone radioimmunoassay-positive material in the gonads, intestine and haemolymph of the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea during adult ontogenetic development were studied. The animals were divided into two groups: group 1 – control males and females reared for a period of 36 days after adult ecdysis at temperature 29 ± 1°C; group 2 – experimental males and females reared from day 8 to day 18 at 15°C and then at the same temperature as cockroaches of group 1. The immunoreactive progesterone concentration in gonads and intestine of females from group 1 reached the highest value on day 24 and 27. In females from group 2, the progesterone peak shifted to days 35–38. Females from group 1 gave birth to nymphs on day 36, females of group 2 on days 42–45. In males of group 2, a similar shift of the progesterone peak was observed.

N2  - Adult female two spot ladybirds Adalia bipunctata (L.) were reluctant to eat their own eggs. Similarly, second instar larvae avoided eating sibling eggs. However, adult males did not appear to avoid eating eggs they had sired and hungry third instar larvae showed no reluctance to consume younger sibling larvae. These results indicate that female beetles and young larvae are capable of kin recognition. The adaptive significance of this is discussed.

N2  - A four-parameter nonlinear regression model was fitted to development data of six stored-product moth species (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) reared at various constant temperatures, and at 60–80% relative humidity on wheat or wheat-based diets. The model provided new information and quantitative description for predicting egg, larval, pupal, and egg-to-adult (total) development times, and also was useful in comparing the influence of relative humidity and diet on development times. Averaged across the six moth species, about 8%, 77%, and 15% of total development time was spent in egg, larval, and pupal stages, respectively. Temperature had the greatest influence on egg-to-adult development time, followed by relative humidity and diet. The temperatures for maximum and minimum development rates (1/development time), and degree-days required for egg-to-adult development, varied with the species. Independently derived egg-to-adult development times (n = 39) for the moth species reared at fewer than five temperatures, and at 50–90% relative humidity on different diets, were compared with those predicted by the four-parameter model for the same species. Across all six species, in 64% of the cases, development times predicted by the model were within 3 days of the actual data. In 23% and 13% of the cases, model predictions were within 4–10 and >10 days, respectively, of the actual data.

N2  - Laboratory and field experiments were performed to test the ability of steinernematid nematodes to control larvae of the black vine weevil, Otiorrhynchus sulcatus, which infests rhododendrons and azaleas in Czech Republic. Of five strains tested in the laboratory the best results were achieved with the Steinernema feltiae strain Hyl isolated in Czech Republic, which provided a 100% elimination of the weevil larvae on azaleas in laboratory tests. Field tests were made in a nursery of ornamentals at Plzen-Krimice where an outbreak of the pest had lasted a long time. Preventative treatment, three releases of the nematode, was performed in three beds in successive seasons 1989–90, resulting in a 72% to 88% protection of plants in the beds, including a 52% to 77% protection in adjacent plots due to migration of nematodes from the treated areas. Only 30% of plants survived on more distant control plots. This system of control of O. sulcatus with steinernematids is a promising method of biological protection in ornamental nurseries and gardens.

This infraorder of the hemipteran suborder Heteroptera comprises five superfamilies, under either of two arrangements. Under the first: Aradoidea, Pentatomoidea, Coreoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, and Lygaeoidea; under the second: Aradoidea, Pentatomoidea, Coreoidea (including Coreoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea, and part of Lygaeoidea of the first arrangement), Idiostoloidea, and Piesmatoidea (these two removed from the Lygaeoidea of the first arrangement). The infraorder Cimicomorpha is probably the sister group of Pentatomomorpha, and Leptopodomorpha may be the sister group of both those two infraorders. The ancestor of the Coreoidea, Pyrrhocoroidea (first arrangement), and perhaps Pentatomoidea may have been lygaeoid-like. The taxonomic and phylogenetic position of the Aradoidea is obscure. The classification (to family level) of the Pentatomomorpha is tabulated.

N2  - The storage protein of the cabbage moth (M. brassicae L.) was purified from larval haemolymph by anion exchange chromatography, followed by preparative electrophoresis and elution. Histochemical staining revealed that the storage protein is a glyco-lipoprotein. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis suggested that this protein is composed of two dominant – Mr 81.9 and 74.6 kD – and five minor – Mr 64.1, 58.3, 50.1, 40.8 and 38.2 kD – subunits. Electrofocusing separation showed the presence of these subunits at pH 5.4–6.3. The conformation of the storage protein was equally stable at pH ranging from 4 to 9. The M. brassicae storage protein is immunologically related to Lymantria dispar arylphorin.

N2  - The oogenesis, oviposition and longevity of individually-held cabbage root fly, Delia radicum (L.), females that were deprived of mating opportunities, host plants or adult foods were compared with those of flies that were not deprived. The rate of formation of the first batch of mature eggs was not influenced by this deprivation. The lack of proteins or carbohydrates in the diet reduced total fecundity and also, in the case of carbohydrates, longevity. The absence of a host plant resulted in a blocked oviposition and a retarded development of the second and subsequent follicles. After some period of host deprivation (highly variable among individuals), egg development in the second follicles recommenced, and females oviposited even though host plant cues were lacking. Virgin females also showed a delayed onset of oviposition, had a lower total fecundity and a shorter life span and retained two or even three eggs in each ovariole at the time of death. Variability within treatment groups was great, ranging in females that were deprived of host plant or mating opportunities from almost complete inhibition of eg

N2  - In this study we analyze the successional strategies for belowground space occupation and partitioning in Mediterranean ant communities on fallow land. Three successional sequences were established, by means of a number of plots representing disturbance patches with different surrounding matrices (forests, uncultivated and cultivated land). The belowground extension of the colonies was mapped on a grid of squares. The amount of space occupied by the ant colonies increased during the three successional sequences. The colonies increased significantly in number but not in size in areas surrounded by uncultivated or cultivated land. The contrary occurred when the surrounding matrix was composed of forest (significant increase in size but not in number). Finally, those study areas with an expectedly higher propagule flux (founding queens) from the surrounding matrix (mosaic of uncultivated fields and forest) showed a significant increase in overlapping on the space of neighbouring colonies. The analysis of the colony size of the most abundant species showed that each maintains a certain colony size, which did not vary among the areas studied. The proportion of mature species (characteristic of later successional stages) is greater in areas with a more mature surrounding matrix. Species composition is suggested to be a key factor in explaining the different strategies developed by ant communities in their colonization of disturbance patches.

The relation proves as the literature predicts, to be a power function. When the species are grouped according to size and body shape, however, it seems that a linear relation may also provide good biomass predictions on the basis of length.

The rate of feeding deterrency measured after treatment with oils of I. racemosa and S. lappa at these concentrations ranged from 20 to 72% and 18 to 62%, respectively. The rate of mortality during larval and prepupal stages was greater than 50% at the 5% concentration. Pupation was adversely affected only at the highest concentration of both oils. Pupal weight was normal, while adult emergence was marginally affected by both oil treatments.

N2  - The red firebug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.), has been a convenient model for biological research for a long time. The interest in P. apterus increased especially with the discovery in the mid-1960\'s of the so-called \'\'paper factor\'\', i.e., a substance with juvenile hormone activity. Considerable research has been done on this model insect in research topics such as biogeography, embryology, developmental and reproductive biology, theoretical and applied endocrinology, biochemistry, cytogenetics and formal genetics, bionomics, ethology, pathology, voltinism, diapause, wing polymorphism, migration, pathogens, symbiotes and predators. Some of the newest studies are directed toward the problems of determination of metameric pattern, cold hardiness and biorhythms. Present review provides the first selective summary of data published in almost 300 papers.

N2  - Aggregation pheromones of the nitidulids, Carpophilus hemipterus (L.), C. freemani Dobson, C. mutilatus Erichson, and C. lugubris Murray were field tested at two sites (one in Crawford County and the other in Knox County) in Ohio. At both sites traps baited with pheromone plus bread dough caught at least five times more adult beetles than bread dough by itself. Trap design and height influenced trap catch. In most cases the nitidulid inventory technique trap yielded more nitidulids than did the wind-oriented pipe trap or the Japanese beetle trap. Trap performance in the field was dependent upon the nitidulid species responding. Aerial traps were preferred by C. lugubris and C. hemipterus, while C. freemani indicated no clear preference between aerial or ground traps. Two additional nitidulid species were captured in relatively large numbers by the coattractant: Stelidota geminata (Say), and Glischrochilus quadrisignatus (Say).

N2  - Results from field samples indicate that the percentage of eggs laid by the monophagous leaf beetle, Zygogramma suturalis directly on the host plant (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) changes during the course of the season. These changes in oviposition were not associated with changes in the host specificity of larvae or adult beetles. In June–August the percentage of eggs laid on A. artemisiifolia was inversely correlated with Z. suturalis larval population density. It is speculated that high larval density deterred ovipositing females.

N2  - Allozyme variation was investigated in winter moth adults from four isolated localities in South Bohemia. Ten gene loci, five of which were polymorphic, were studied. Significant deviations of genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed at most of polymorphic loci within the populations. The average heterozygosities for winter moth populations from four ecologically distinct localities ranged from 0. 146 to 0.279. The winter moth FST mean value of 0. 171 was relatively higher than that found in most other Lepidoptera, indicating fragmented population structure. The Červené Blato population had the greatest genetic distance (D = 0.265) from the other three populations. The genetic distance and FST values reflect geographic distance of the studied populations.

At all of the sites, metal concentrations conformed to the order Zn> Fe> Cu> Mn> Ni> Pb> Co> Cd> Cr> Hg. The highest concentration of toxic metals (lead and cadmium) was found in moths associated with trees along the main road in Plástovice (3.1 and 1.1 ppm, respectively), while it was lowest in the Èervené Blato peat bog (1.1 and 0.1 ppm, respectively). The main parasitoids were two tachinid flies, Cyzenis albicans Fall. and Phorocera obscura Fall., and one ichneumonid wasp, Agrypon flaveolatum Grav. Overall parasitism was low (2.8 and 5.9% in 1991 and 1992, respectively). The highest percentage of parasitism was on larvae in the unpolluted Èervené Blato bog (4.8 and 28.3% in 1991 and in 1992, respectively), and the lowest on apple trees along the main road in Plastovice, which was the most polluted site of the four localities.

A list of the Lepidoptera (569 species) recorded from this peat bog is given along with notes on the relict species (tyrphobionts) and their food plants. All of the stenotopic tyrphobiontic and most of the tyrphophilous species are associated with boreal and subarctic ecosystems. All the tyrphobionts feed on peat bog plants, e.g., Ledum palustre L. and Vaccinium uliginosum L. The tyrphobionts are cold-adapted boreal and subarctic species, which are associated weakly with bogs near the subarctic tree line. The \'\'boreal\'\' like habitat island of the Èervené Blato bog is unique in the temperate zone of Central Europe. The entomological uniqueness of the locality is documented and the need for habitat conservation stressed.

N2  - I present the thesis that the most effective means of developing a unified theory of host exploitation by aphidophagous insects would be through a rational, first-principles approach. This approach entails the use of life history theory wherein host acceptance \'\'decisions\'\' are evaluated on the basis of contribution to current and future lifetime reproductive success wherein future success is discounted by life expectancy. A simple example involving egg load and host discrimination demonstrates the value of dynamic life history theory as a means of structuring experimental and empirically based research programs. Finally, I argue that a unified theory of host acceptance for aphidophagous insects must consider: (1) spatial distribution of hosts (2) hyperparasitoids and (3) population dynamics of telescoping generations of hosts.

N2  - Coccinellids, particularly their larvae are very voracious. Their foraging behaviour has been extensively studied in an attempt to determine their potential for controlling pest aphids, which occur in patches that are relatively short lived and within which the aphids are not uniformly distributed but clumped. In seeking aphid prey ladybirds like other insect predators forage both extensively and intensively, and use visual and olfactory cues for orientation. Intensive search follows an encounter with an aphid and serves to keep the predator in the vicinity of a cluster of prey. The success of larvae in capturing prey is dependent on abiotic and biotic factors such as plant structure, species of aphid attacked, the predator, in particular its age, level of hunger and genetic characteristics, and intra- and interspecific competition. It is suggested that the poor progress in developing a foraging theory for insect predators, and ladybirds in particular, is a consequence of having mainly concentrated on the foraging behaviour of the most voracious stage, the larva. The behaviour of larvae serves to keep them within the patch selected by the adult. Thus for a better understanding we need information on the cues used by ladybird adults to assess the quality of patches of prey.

N2  - In the period of reproductive activity and foraging for prey coccinellids undertake trivial (appetitive) flights. The irregular long-distance flights of \'\'swarms\'\' of ladybirds originate in hypermobility of starving beetles of the new generation. Two types of regular long-distance flights are related to dormancy: diapausing coccinellids migrate to dormancy sites by directional flight and after dormancy they disperse gradually to breeding sites. There is abundant evidence that most long-distance migrants are hypsotactically attracted to prominent landmarks, at least in the closing part of their migratory flight. None of the methods used to quantify the tendency to migratory flight (duration of tethered flight, incidence of take-offs, wing-spreading response) gave a completely satisfactory result; the first-mentioned technique is the most promising. When migrating to dormancy sites coccinellids usually have immature ovaries (primary or regressed), and thus conform to Johnson\'s \'\'oogenesis - flight syndrome\'\'. In contrast, during the dispersal flight their ovaries are partly matured. Although there is a general consent about the importance of juvenile hormone for the flight, it is still not clear how the regulation of flight is coordinated with the well established stimulatory role of JH in reproduction. There are indications that an intermediate titre of JH might stimulate both the flight and the early phases of ovarial maturation.

The most attractive odour sources were PHC and HDP, which both stimulated a similar high number of oriented straight flights. In contrast, H and P were much less attractive and did not seem to be important in the long range attraction of the parasitoids.

The parasitoid response has been assessed in a Petri dish choice test by presenting an aphid dummy consisting of a glass bead coated with cornicle secretion along with an untreated bead, which acted as a control. Naive females responded similarly to the treated glass beads and aphids, while experienced females responded less to the treated beads than to aphids. The kairomonal activity of the cornicle secretion decreased as the wax dried. The behavioural response registered seems to be innate and not induced by associative learning.

N2  - Foraging theory has largely concentrated on oviposition rate as the currency parasitoids use to maximize reproductive success. Female parasitoids foraging in a patchy environment face a variety of mortality risks that influence the survival of both themselves and their offspring. A foraging model is developed to suggest that patch residence times in parasitoids should be based on the trade-off between female and offspring mortality risks. The fitness gain of parasitoids that include all mortality risks in their calculation of optimal patch residence time is then compared to the fitness gain of rate-maximizing females, and to the fitness gain of females that ignore offspring, mortality. It is shown that rate-maximizing foragers and foragers ignoring offspring mortality may suffer from substantial losses in fitness. The long-term average rate of eclosing adults produced and the lifetime number of eggs laid are therefore fitness currencies that are likely not to be selected for in insect parasitoids.

N2  - Females of the aphid parasitoid Praon volucre were attracted to lures containing synthetic aphid sex pheromone components, particularly (+)-(4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone, when these were placed on water traps in cereal fields in autumn. Trap catches were greatest at a site in S.W.England and fewest at sites in northern England \'and northern Germany, presumably due to climatic differences. Responses to the pheromones were not detected for any other cereal aphid parasitoids in the field trials, although Aphidius rhopalosiphi appears to possess olfactory receptors for (+)-(4aS,7S,7aR)-nepetalactone. A potential strategy for the use of aphid sex pheromone lures to manipulate aphid parasitoids in the field, in order to enhance their impact on aphid populations, is outlined.

N2  - Hyperparasitoids are, considered to reduce the effectiveness of primary parasitoids as biological control agents of aphids in a variety of crops. Recently it was shown that volatiles produced by the hyperparasitoid Alloxysta victrix (Westwood) elicit a dispersal in female primary parasitoids thereby potentially reducing primary parasitoid activity in the field at certain times. The active chemical was identified as 6-methyl-5-heptene-2-one (MHO) which is produced by both male and female A. victrix. The function of this chemical in the intraspecific communication of A. victrix was studied. Y-tube olfactometer experiments revealed corresponding effects of MHO and natural odour sources. Males were attracted to females especially when not mated. Females were repelled by females. These effects could partly be mimicked with pure MHO in the olfactometer. In Petri dish experiments the behaviour of A. victrix in the presence of MHO odour was video-analysed. As in the olfactometer, males were attracted to the odour and females repelled. We conclude that MHO is a sex pheromone which attracts A. victrix males and as spacing pheromone enables an even distribution of females in the field.

N2  - A model optimizing the number of eggs laid in an aphid colony by an adult ladybird reveals that there exists an optimum number, which maximizes the resulting offspring biomass. This remains true even if the model is expanded to include more than one adult ladybird and several aphid colonies. Adult ladybirds should not continue to aggregate in areas of aphid abundance (Kareiva & Odell, 1987), but should leave an aphid aggregate, even though the aphids are still increasing in abundance, as soon as a certain number of eggs are laid and/or larvae are present. If the ladybirds lay the optimal number of eggs, then their offspring have only a slight effect on the peak number of aphids.

N2  - Coccinellids and syrphids that feed on aphids and coccids face the same problem: an unstable food supply. Their eggs and larvae face cannibalism and/or starvation if the aphid colony they attack declines in abundance before they mature. Optimal foraging theory predicts that such predators should lay a few eggs early in the development of an aphid colony. Studies on two species of coccinellid and one species of syrphid revealed that they do respond to the quality as well as the abundance of their prey. By refraining from laying eggs in aphid colonies already exploited by predators and those that are shortly to decline in abundance when the aphids disperse, these predators are able to forage in a way that is consistent with the predictions of optimal foraging theory.

N2  - Food stress experienced during larval and adult life in Coccinella septempunctata L. results in variation in the rate of production of eggs per unit time and in the size of egg clusters but not in egg size. This lends support to the suggestion that egg size is constrained by the minimum size at which first instar larvae can capture active prey and/or complete their development before prey become scarce. When supplied with an excess of food large beetles produce larger clusters of eggs than small beetles. This is associated with the large females having more ovarioles in their gonads than small females. As the proportion of eggs that give rise to larvae remains the same for clusters of from 6 to 60 eggs there appear to be no costs, in terms of increased predispersal sibling cannibalism, to laying larger clusters of eggs.

N2  - The cold hardiness of two ladybird species from the Czech Republic, Coccinella septempunctata and Semiadalia undecimnotata, was measured in terms of their supercooling point (SCP) and survival at subzero temperatures. The SCP was lower in diapausing beetles in late summer than in active beetles, and the SCP of diapausing beetles decreased slowly until mid-winter. The SCP of S. undecimnotata, which overwinters exposed to air, was lower (to –19°C), that of C. septempunctata, which overwinters at ground level insulated in plant material, was higher (to –15°C). The SCP of C. septempunctata, exposed to extreme fluctuations of temperature in an outdoor insectary, decreased to –21°C. After the termination of diapause, the SCP of C. septempunctata from natural hibernacula increased in the later part of the cold period. In contrast, the SCP of S. undecimnotata and C. septempunctata in an outdoor insectary remained low until spring. The cost of being more cold-hardy is possibly compensated for by a low mortality from fungal disease.

N2  - Feeding behaviour of the wolf spider Pardosa hortensis Thorell (Araneae: Lycosidae) was studied in the laboratory under different prey densities. Feeding characteristics were monitored by a behaviour registering computer program. The amount of prey eaten in the different prey density treatments indicated a Holling type II functional response. Handling time was negatively correlated with prey density. At higher prey densities spiders sometimes attacked and fed on more than one prey item at the same time. Consumption rate during such multiple feeding events was higher than during single feeding. However, multiple feeding was much less frequent than single feeding. Killing without feeding and the partial consumption of the prey was also observed in high prey densities. The degree of this behaviour was positively correlated with prey density. The observed feeding strategy of this wolf spider suggests that spiders can have a positive role in controlling agricultural pests in a density sensitive way.

N2  - Clonal samples of aphids were used as the groups in canonical variate (CV) analysis, in order to compare the temperature responses of single genotypes, and thus to distinguish genotypic and environmental contributions to the phenotypic response pattern. The analysis was based on a large data set obtained by measuring 19 linear variables on adult apterae reared at four temperatures (10, 15, 20 and 26.5°C). The species used were Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and its close relative, M. antirrhinii (Macchiati). Two vectors - the scores on the first two CV\'s - were invariably needed to describe the temperature response. In each of three M. persicae clones, the first CV had a close linear correlation with temperature, partly corresponding to the decrease in body size at higher temperature, whereas the temperature relationship of the second CV fitted a quadratic function, being less at both high and low temperatures, and reflecting a change of \'\'shape\'\', partly comprising a relative decrease in lengths of appendages at low temperature. In M. antirrhinii the temperature relations of these two CV\'s was reversed, that of CV1 being quadratic and that of CV2 linear. When different genotypes of a species were combined in the same analysis, the first and second CV\'s still described the \'\'two-way\'\' response to temperature as for clones analysed separately, but the third and fourth CV\'s were totally independent of rearing temperature and separated samples according to their genotype. The consistency with which temperature effects are allocated to the first two variates seems to indicate the presence of two different aspects of the phenotypic response to temperature, perhaps reflecting different metabolic pathways by which temperature affects the pattern of growth.

Both between morph and within morph differences were found for a range of morphometric features and ratios. When aphids of both morphs and from a range of conditions were considered together any morph differences were obscured by phenotypic variability. SimilarIy canonical variate analysis indicated that differences due to environmental variability were greater than those due to morph.

N2  - In this paper we use the concept of the evolutionary individual as the basis for an attempt to characterise sex-allocation patterns in aphids. We then examine the various selection pressures involved in the evolution of aphids\' sex ratios, and propose a novel explanation for biased sex allocation in host-alternating aphidines, in which inbreeding is impossible. Their production of gynoparae (females that migrate from secondary to primary hosts to produce the sexual females) before males is the clonal equivalent of sex reversal - sequential hermaphroditism. Selection on the timing of the reversal, and thus the overall sex-allocation ratio, should depend largely on the rate of decline of the populations on the secondary hosts in autumn and on how long it takes oviparae (sexual females) to reach maturity. The longer the nymphal period of the oviparae, the sooner investment in gynoparae becomes futile, since both gynoparae and oviparae must mature and oviparae must oviposit before leaf-fall. It is the combination of a deadline - leaf-fall - and a delay - the two generations that must be completed between allocation to gynoparae and oviposition - that determines the selection on the allocation ratios of host-alternating aphidines. Data on Rhopalosiphum padi in Scotland and Sweden show a strong female bias, as the model predicts.

N2  - Consequences of birth weight for development, survival and fecundity were studied in the offspring of the alate morph Aphis craccivora (Koch), with the aim of testing the hypothesis that birth weight is near optimal. Aphids large at birth were found to mature sooner and achieve higher total reproduction than those born smaller. A bootstrapping procedure was used to estimate the correlation between birth weight and two measures of fitness (rm): one calculated from unadjusted life-table data, the other from life tables adjusted to correct for the trade-off between offspring weight and offspring number. The unadjusted data yield a highly significant positive correlation - large neonates are fitter than small ones. The correlation estimated from the adjusted life table is no longer significant - mothers producing large offspring are no fitter than those producing small ones.

N2  - Aphis fabae took 3 to 4 hours, after access to a plant, to show the first puncture of a sieve element. A further hour was needed before sustained ingestion started. Early probes did not show sieve element punctures, in general. Within later probes, showing these punctures, the average time needed to reach them was 30 min. Early sieve element punctures were mainly accompanied by the secretion of a watery saliva. The composition of this saliva and the function of its secretion is unknown. It is speculated that this saliva secretion makes the phloem sap more readily available and/or improves its quality for aphids. Further research is needed to test this hypothesis.

N2  - It is generally considered that many specialist insects, such as aphids, have overcome chemical barriers to successful feeding and turned them to their own advantage as host recognition cues and phagostimulants. It is suggested that plants may counter-respond to the presence of specialised insect herbivores by manipulating recognition cues and phagostimulants to the detriment of the insect. One might expect this to involve the plant depriving the insect of access to these chemicals at critical periods in the insect\'s life cycle. Evidence in support of the \'resource deprival\' hypothesis is presented from work carried out on the large pine aphid, Cinara pinea. Here, taxifolin, a possible phagostimulant, is withdrawn from the phloem to the outer shoot tissues in midsummer, with a subsequent decline in aphid growth and survival.

Using 14C labelling we compared the sink strength of the gall of each species for its ability to manipulate the normal phloem transport from different sources. The results indicated that none of the galls had net photosynthetic ability and all of them imported assimilates according to their specific sink strength. The data also demonstrated a correspondence between the ability of galls to draw assimilates from wider sources (sink strength) and aphid reproductive performance. Furthermore, preliminary observations indicated that species which are stronger sinks have a negative impact over other galling aphids on the same leaf or shoot through withdrawal of assimilates and nutrients.

N2  - This paper reviews the evidence for the fundatrix specialization hypothesis and attempts to quantify the relative advantage of host alternation and define the conditions favouring the evolution of this way of life. Contrary to the predictions of the fundatrix specialization hypothesis there does not appear to be a barrier to some host alternating Aphidinae transferring their whole life cycle over to a secondary host plant. The coexistence of plants with asynchronous phenologies supplied the potential and the ability of aphids to produce a number of highly prolific generations in quick succession, which amplify the differences in performance on the two hosts and more than offsets the costs of transfer between hosts, supplies the means of exploiting this potential. That is, host alternation is not maladaptive and maintained by constraint but adaptive, at least in the Aphidinae.

N2  - In holocylic aphid species many different morphs are produced during the phase of parthenogenetic reproduction. Because these morphs differ in their life-histories, research has been focused on how individual life-histories can be explained in the framework of maximizing the Malthusian parameter rm. All these different morphs are produced by the same genotype. Since it is the genotype that selection acts on it is questionable whether the intrinsic rates of increase of individual morphs can be used to make inferences about the fitness of the genotype. A simple model is developed to investigate the relationship between individual rm and clonal fitness in the case of wing dimorphism of aphids in summer. In the model, survival and fecundity of winged and unwinged morphs depend on the quality of their host plants, and unwinged aphids have to decide which morph to produce in the next generation to maximize the number of eggs produced at the end of the season. The model shows that clonal fitness depends on the sequence of morphs produced and that the relationship between individual and clonal rate of increase is not straightforward. The decision as to which morph to produce is influenced by the quality and distribution of the host plants and depends also on the time of the year. It is suggested that rm-values of individual morphs should be treated with care when aphid life-history is to be explained.

N2  - The suborder Sternorrhyncba (Insecta: Homoptera) includes aphids, whiteflies, psyllids and scale insects; these are all large diverse groups of herbivorous insects that feed on plant sap and that include many of the most damaging agricultural pests. All of these insects are dependent on obligately intracellular procaryotic symbionts for their survival. In this collaborative project between Nancy Moran and Carol von Dohlen, both insect biologists, and Paul Baumann, a bacteriologist, molecular phylogenetic methods have been used to explore the evolutionary history of these mutualistic interactions. Using PCR amplification with procaryote-specific primers, DNA sequences have been obtained for the 16S ribosomal gene of the endosymbionts from approximately 20 species of Sternorrhyncha, including 13 aphids. On the basis of these sequences as well as published 16S sequences from representative procaryotes, a phylogenetic tree has been constructed, using parsimony methods. Results indicate that the primary endosymbionts of aphids belong to a single distinctive clade that has descended from a single infection of a common ancestor of aphids; this conclusion is based on complete congruence between the phylogenetic tree for the endosymbionts and that for the aphid hosts. Based on fossils that give minimal ages for certain of the aphid lineages, the association is at least 80 million years old. The rate of change of the 16S sequence is roughly constant among lineages within the aphid primary endosymbiont clade. Again using fossil dating, we have estimated absolute rates of substitution, and estimates are consistent for three different aphid clades. These rates have been used to test the hypothesis based on a biogeographic argument that the divergence between the Asian and American members of the Melaphidina dates to the Eocene (approximately 50 MY ago): the molecular data are highly supportive of the hypothesis. The 16S genes of secondary endosymbionts of aphids and of endosymbionts of mealybugs and whiteflies have also been sequenced, and results indicate that, for each insect group, endosymbiotic bacteria are descendants of independent infections by other members of the gamma-subdivision of the Proteobacteria for each insect group.

N2  - Some aphid species of the tribe Macrosiphini possess a row of peg-like hairs on the hind tibiae, which resemble the plectrum of the sound producing apparatus in Toxoptera (tribe Aphidini). In addition to the three earlier recorded cases in the genus Macrosiphoniella (M. jaroslavi Szelegiewicz, M. myohyangsani Szelegiewicz, M. spinipes Basu) and Macrosiphum (Sitobion) gravelii van der Goot, these hind tibial pegs were found in Macrosiphoniella millefolii (DeGeer) and 10 species of the genus Uroleucon. In the Aphidini the plectrum is a transformed posterior row of hairs (rastral setae), whereas in Macrosiphini it is a posteroventral row of hairs. If in the latter it forms part of a sound producing apparatus, then the only available structure which might function as the file (strigil) is the reticulate zone at the apices of the siphunculi.

N2  - Migratory flight of sexuparae of gall forming Fordinae to 3 species of Pistacia hosts was monitored using sticky traps. Sexuparae arrived from late March to July. Species arrival time distributions overlapped but modes did not coincide. Although the Fordinae are strictly host-specific, sexuparae landed and reproduced not infrequently on the wrong Pistacia host, a reproductive dead end. These results show that their host-selection ability is imperfect.

N2  - The behaviour of Aphis fabae during maiden flight in an automated flight chamber was assessed by their response to the intermittent presentation of a plant-like visual target. As shown previously, alate virginoparae were much more responsive to the target, i.e. indicating foraging flight, during the initial part of maiden flight than were gynoparae. Virginoparae initiated foraging flight after a short behavioural migratory period, i.e. the initial period of flight when the aphid remains unresponsive to the target, (on average 8 ± 5 min) while gynoparae undertook a longer migratory flight (on average 102 ± 19 min). However, if starved for 24 h, under conditions that did not allow flight, both aphid forms initiated foraging flights more readily and the period of behavioural migration was reduced (0.7 ± 0.3 vs 36 ± 11 min, virginoparae vs gynoparae). This observation indicates that the initiation of foraging flight, and thus the duration of migratory flight, can be influenced by factors other than flight per se.

N2  - The rates of spatial expansion of range following the introduction of animals to new areas are extremely variable between species. Data on a selection of species from a range of taxa show that these rates vary over about five orders of magnitude. The range expansion of a limited number of pest species of aphids have been mapped following colonisation. Studies on rates of colonisation are important as they are central to pest risk analysis. In addition, the observed variation in rates have significant implications for the development of realistic models of metapopulations.

N2  - An answer to this question is proposed on the basis of the assumed evolutionary history of aphids based on palaeontological studies, zoogeographical data and estimated origin of each aphid genus in the world. An adaptive radiation of Aphididae and Lachnidae occurred rather late in the Tertiary on the northern hemisphere, and the tropics acted as a barrier. Most aphid genera endemic to the temperate regions of the southern hemisphere belong to other groups. The life cycles of aphids are discussed, and it is concluded, that the life cycles characteristic to most aphids in the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere are developed as an adaptation to the climatic conditions there.

N2  - Using time series of estimates of population abundances of moths from a light-trap in Brno, Czech Republic, the usefulness of a number of variability measures was examined. There are two problems that may occur. One is that time series data of population counts usually do not constitute a series of independent data, another is the occurrence of zeros when logarithms need to be taken. It is assumed here that the observed zeros no not represent extinction. All but one of the measures used suffered from the problem with interdependent abundances, making these measures difficult to use in statistical testing. The exception, ln{var(ln[Ri])}, on the other hand, generally, though not always, deals with mutually independent Ri (= yi/y(i-1)) and can then be used in statistical tests. This measure, however, measures variability of change rather than overall variability as the other statistics do. Moreover, when series with zeros are included, the arbitrariness of dealing with these zeros detracts also from the usefulness of this measure. Avoiding one of the problems usually forces one to accept the other, except when there are no zeros in the data. It being impossible for us to properly deal with this dilemma, we explored its consequences, especially those of dealing with zeros in one way or another. Any conclusions are purely ad hoc. When, in the literature, zeros presented a problem, they were either replaced by some positive number, the zero replacement value (ZRV), or one used the ln(yi + z) transformation, with various values of z. We tried both in the present paper. Time series with a mean abundance smaller than 5 were found unreliable and should be omitted from analyses. The ln(yi + z) transformation should be avoided for series without zeros and does not perform better than the ln(yi) transformation for series with zeros. No statistically robust solution for the problem with zero values seems to exist, but for both mean and variability of abundance, a ZRV of 0.5 provided the most acceptable log transformation. For correlation between abundance and time the value of ZRV used was unimportant. One can avoid having to take the logarithms of zero by selecting only time series without zeros, but this implies a strong selection against the more variable species. Alternatively one can use ln[CV], or Lloyd\'s index, although one still has to deal with the interdependence of the data.

N2  - In both vertebrates and insects, steroid hormones are known to control diverse physiological events from reproduction to growth and development, primarily by affecting the expression of specific genes. Despite the vast evolutionary distance between arthropods and vertebrates, the molecular mechanisms by which steroids act to regulate genes appear to be conserved. Our understanding of these principles has been advanced significantly during the past few years, owing to the molecular characterisation of genes which encode steroid hormone receptors. This article provides a general survey of the superfamily of nuclear hormone receptors and their mode of action and summarizes the recent knowledge on members of this superfamily discovered in Drosophila and other insects.

N2  - A monoclonal antibody to Bombyx mori eclosion hormone (EH) reacted in whole mounts of the nervous system from pharate and freshly hatched larvae of this species with 4 ventromedial brain neurons and a pair of nerve fibers runing down the ventral nerve cord. Weak immunoreactivity was occasionally detected in similar whole preparations of the nervous system from Antheraea yamamai. In paraffin sections of the nervous system of A. yamamai, an EH-like antigen was found in 4 ventromedial brain neurons, in 2 or 3 pairs of neurons in each of the ventral ganglia, and in a pair of nerve fibers extending through the nerve cord. The intensity of immunostaining in diapausing and post-diapausing pre-hatched larvae, and in the newly hatched first-instar larvae, was similar. Midgut endocrine cells were also examined but no reaction with the anti-EH antibody was detected.

N2  - Lepidoptera populations were monitored during 29 years by a light-trap in urban Brno. Compared with other sites in the Czech Republic (Prague-Ruzynì, Èeské Budĕjovice, Černiš) urban Brno was extraordinarily rich in species, richer than the other Czech sites studied and richer than many British sites in an urban to natural gradient. Variability of the more common species at Brno was as high as that at the ruderal/deteriorated agricultural setting at Ceske Budejovice, and generally higher than that in the wet forest environment at Cernis and much higher than in the park-like/suburban/agricultural setting of Prague. Voltinism had no effect on variability from year to year. Most of the more common species in Brno clearly increased in abundance over the years, unlike those at the other sites. Much of the large diversity at Brno, however, was because of a large number of accidental species, vagrants from elsewhere. When considering only the more common species (>= 5 individuals per year), however, Brno is among the most species-poor sites. The common species at Brno were mostly tramp species that could take advantage of whatever food and habitat the city had to offer. Because of strong correlations in abundance between species at one site with conspecifics at other sites over distances of 150–200 km, the abundances in these populations are apparently strongly affected by large-scale processes such as weather, overriding in part large differences between the habitats or by large-scale dispersal of individuals between sites. Significant correlations also existed between conspecifics in these sites in variability as well as in trends in time, with the curious exception of Cernis, the only reasonably natural habitat, suggesting that these parameters are strongly affected by local habitat characteristics.

N2  - In 1989–1991, populations of Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) on maize in western Czechoslovakia were investigated. Aphid abundance was followed on plants subject to water stress and weed competition and of different ages, sown between late March–late June. Shoot size, growth rate and leaf nitrogen content of the plants affected the performance of aphid populations. Aphids colonized maize stands in early June, after 400 to 500 day degrees (dd), above a 5°C threshold, had accumulated since January 1. Initial abundance varied annually and with host plant size, between 0.1 and 9.9 aphids per plant. Population peak was attained in late June–early July (700–750 dd), after 190–300 dd of exponential population growth. The growth rate of aphid populations was significantly correlated with the growth rate and leaf nitrogen content of maize. Maximum aphid numbers varied annually and were greater on vigorous than on stunted plants. The differences in aphid abundance persisted when recalculated per unit host plant weight. Aphids colonized the lower leaves of maize. The main difference with the population development of M. dirhodum on winter wheat was the greater initial numbers per plant. Rate of population growth varied more and its duration was shorter on maize than on wheat. Maximum numbers per unit plant weight were similar on both crops.

N2  - In this mini-review, data on the circadian rhythmicity in ecdysteroid synthesis by the prothoracic glands of final instar larvae of the wax moth (Galleria mellonella), as well as ecdysteroid titers in their hemolymph are summarized. It was found that at the low temperature of 18°C and in continuous darkness (DD), the last instar of the wax moth larvae did not pupate. When these larvae were transferred to 30°C and kept in DD, they immediately initiated development and pupated in a circadian manner. They exhibited the circadian rhythmicity of ecdysteroid titers in their hemolymph, with a period of approximately 24 hours. The mechanism underlying circadian rhythmicity of ecdysteroid titers in the hemolymph of Galleria mellonella larvae was investigated. It was found that brain removal or head-ligating of larvae in which developmental processes had been synchronized by transfer from 18°C to 30°C, did not abolish daily rhythms of ecdysteroid titers in the hemolymph. The observed rhythms persisted in continuous darkness for 5 days after treatment, which suggests that the circadian clock driving these rhythms is not located within the brain.In further experiments, it was shown that the prothoracic glands, taken from temperature-synchronized last instar larvae of Galleria, exhibited a daily rhythm of ecdysteroid synthesis, with a maximum coinciding with the peak of ecdysteroid titers found in controls. Therefore, it is suggested that the circadian rhythm of ecdysteroid titers in the hemolymph of these larvae is regulated by a clock, located probably within the prothoracic glands.

N2  - Selection for resistance to fenpropathrin (a pyrethroid insecticide) was performed by exposing adults of two field-collected populations of the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, to increasing doses of fenpropathrin for four generations. Concurrently, samples of adults were used for colorimetric measurements of esterase (EST) activity. The two populations differed in their response to selection. EST activity increased as a correlated response to pyrethroid selection in one population but not in the. other. No changes in either resistance or esterase activity were detected in the unselected control lines. The data suggest that both resistance and EST activity have a genetic basis, and that the frequency of high EST-activity alleles may have been different in the two populations.

After larval-pupal apolysis characteristic and consecutive metabolic phases were observed: declining, plateau, ascending and pre-ecdysal steep-falling phases. At the moment of breaking the old integument, a sharp peak of the cooling effect. caused by exuvial fluid, was recorded on the thermogram; thus, the exact time of ecdysis and the length of the interecdysal period were determined. By using thermography, also regular periods of muscular activity in metamorphosis stages were monitored and midgut purging after feeding period was timed.

N2  - Traits of the diapause syndrome in the tropical beetle Stenotarsus rotundus were studied by measuring the supercooling point (SCP), and water and fat contents of the beetles in the period from deep diapause through to their activation. Diapausing beetles utilized. body fat and accumulated water, the utilization rate being very low in untreated beetles and high in those treated with juvenile hormone analogue. Physiological and behavioural mechanisms were found to be involved in adaptation against drought. SCP remained almost unchanged from December through February, at a level normal in diapausing insects from the temperate regions (–13°C). In April, after the termination of diapause, SCP rose to –7°C. Thus a decrease in the SCP seems to be a widespread trait of diapause syndrome, not restricted to temperate insects, and not necessarily connected with true cold tolerance.

N2  - Conidia of Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana were evaluated for activity against adults of the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica, under laboratory conditions. The LC50 values 7 days after exposure to M. anisopliae and B. bassiana were 0.7 and 0.026 mg of conidia/100 adults, respectively at 22–24°C. A sharp increase in mortality was observed 3 and 4 days after treatment with either 10 mg of B. bassiana/100 adults or 10 mg of M. anisopliae/100 adults, respectively. The LT50 values at 10 mg/100 beetles for M. anisopliae and B. bassiana were 4.2 and 3.1 days. respectively. Onset of mortality was further delayed at lower dosages of both fungi. Mortality of adults that were exposed to beetles treated with 10 mg of conidia of M. anisopliae/100 adults immediately following application of conidia or 24 hrs posttreatment was an average of 60 and 43% cumulative mortality. respectively, within 9 days of exposure. Similar exposures of healthy adults to beetles that had been treated with 10 mg of B. bassiana conidia/100 adults resulted in an average of 79 and 43% cumulative mortality, respectively. Beetles killed either by M. anisopliae or B. bassiana and subsequently placed on damp soil manifested signs of patent infection with the fungi, with subsequent production of conidia. The infectivity of M. anisopliae and B. bassiana for adult Japanese beetles and the delay in mortality following treatment provide potential for dispersal of these entomopathogens within populations of P. japonica.

N2  - The intention of this study was to falsify a hypothesis of interspecific avoidance of semiochemicals from egges by ovipositing tortricid females. The oviposition responses of Cydia pomonella (L.) females to apples baited with blends of semiochemicals identified in another tortricid species, Lobesia botrana (Den. et Schiff.) were investigated. Experiments were conducted in binary choice tests using natural oviposition substrates (apples). In each experimental arena, 4 mated females were offered 16 apples (8 treated and 8 untreated) and the number of egges was compared. Females avoid ovipositing on apples treated with a blend of nine components characteristic of methanolic extracts of L. botrana eggs (fatty acids and esters) (complete blend), as well as a binary blend of palmitic acid and methyl palmitate (binary blend). Oviposition avoidance was already observed with these two blends at a dose of 72 eggs equivalent of L. botrana per apple and this effect increased with the dose. The blend of three major esters from complete blend (ternary blend) did not provoke significant avoidance. In the control, only 8.3% of apples bore no egges, this percentage was increased with complete blend and binary blend (720 Lobesia eggs) respectively up to 37.5% and 26.4%, but only to 18.1% of apples with ternary blend. Complete blend and binary blend used at high dose strongly reduced the mean number of eggs/apple on treated fruits (1.6 ± 1.8; 9 compounds) (1.8 ± 2.2; 2 compounds) against 4.6 ± 4.0 in the control. This reduction was not observed with the blend of 3 esters. It is concluded that, from the present results, apples treated with compounds associated with L. botrana eggs are avoided by C. pomonella ovipositing females. Esters alone cannot explain such an avoidance, and palmitic acid may partly cause the avoidance response.

N2  - Larvae of Chrysopa oculata Say mark, chemically, the substrate with a substance secreted from the tip of their abdomen. The effect of paper substrates contaminated with this secretion on the oviposition of C. oculata females was assessed in laboratory choice experiments. The active substance(s) were soluble in chloroform and in water but not in methanol, ethylether or petroleum ether. Paper substrates treated with extracts of the substance remained activeat room temperature for up to three weeks. The effectiveness, in terms of the amount of active secretion produced per unit of larval body weight, was greater for first rather than for third instar larvae. These results indicate the presence of a chemical factor or pheromone that serves to deter females of C. oculata from ovipositing near where larvae of this species are already present.

N2  - The feeding behaviour of five cereal aphid species in wheat seedlings (measured by the time taken by an aphid to penetrate the phloem and the time spent in committed pholem ingestion) and their performance (measured as mean relative growth rates) were determined as a function of hydroxamic acid concentrations in the seedlings. Lower mean relative growth rates and higher times to attain a committed phloem ingestion were associated with higher hydroxamic acid values. Duration of committed phloem ingestion was not influenced by hydroxamic acid values.

N2  - Cellulose acetate electrophoresis was used to investigate genetic variation at 15 enzyme loci in aestivating populations of the sycamore aphid, Drepanosiphum platanoidis (Schrank) (Hemiptera: Drepanosiphidae). The level of polymorphism P (over all loci) was 20%. Of the polymorphic loci, only phosphoglucomutase (PGM), with four alleles, provided consistent, interpretable banding patterns and was subsequently used to investigate population structure and gene flow at various spatial levels in southern Britain. Of 13 aphid aggregations (from single leaves) collected from the lower canopy of a selected tree, only one deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. Genotypic diversity for the PGM locus was generally high and genetic identity measures showed homogeneity between leaf aggregations. Aphid samples collected from eight trees in close proximity, five sites in Hertfordshire and four other sites in southern Britain, also showed homogeneity for alele and genotype frequencies and, in almost all cases, conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations. It was concluded that gene flow, facilitated by trivial and migratory flight, was responsible for the genetic homogeneity observed, both within and between host trees.

N2  - The adult feeding preferences of Hylobius abietis were tested at three temperatures, 10, 15 and 20°C, with three different host plants, Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Fraxinus excelsior, in simple paired choice tests. At all temperatures adult weevils showed a marked and significant preference for P. sylvestris over the other two host plants. F. excelsior was not a preferred host plant and there was some evidence to suggest that at higher temperatures, the presence of F. excelsior inhibited feeding.Adult weevils consumed up to five times as much food at 20°C than they did at 10°C, 252.9 mm2 of bark of P. sylvestris at 20°C compared to 47.8 mm2 at 10°C , 137.2 mm2 of P. abies bark at 20°C compared to 27.3 mm2 at 10°C and 24.6 mm2 of F. excelsior bark at 20°C compared 4.0 mm2 at 10°C.

N2  - In previous papers, the presence of patches of specialized cuticle on the sternites of true bugs of the family Pentatomidae has been reported. The patches, it is thought, are an aid to thermoregulation by aiding heat loss at high temperatures. In this paper, additional descriptions given of patch patterns in Pentatominae and for the first time in Phyllocephalinae extend the range of variation previously recorded in Pentatomidae.More than thirty species of Pentatominae in four tribes (Pentatomini, Antestiini, Halyini, Carpocorini) were examined. Patches were extensively developed in African and Asian Halyini. They were absent, however, in all Australian halyines examined, suggesting the existence of different mechanisms of resistance to heat.Patches were well developed in all 11 species of Phyllocephalinae examined. The most extensive area development of patch cuticle now in Pentatomidae was observed in two phyllocephalines from deserts, Phyllocephala negus and Schyzops aegyptiaca. In Phyllocephalinae, the anatomical distribution of patch cuticle extends to areas of sternite lateral to the spiracles as well as to the laterotergites. Patch areas surfaces in some phyllocephalines are fragmented by bristle-bearing discs.Concerning the pentatomines examined, possible seasonal area variation and variation correlated with geographical isolation was detected in Nezara viridula, a tendency to ventral mid-line fusion of patches on sternites III observed in Carpocorini, and a possible east-west gradient detected in Asian Plautia fimbriata. A high degree of individual variability was recorded in a sample of Carpocoris pudicus from Turkey.Epidermal glands, abundant in males, are generally but not invariably absent in areas occupied by patch cuticle. The absence of glands as an additional tissue element might be explained if thier presence retarded heat loss from the patches.

N2  - The effect of temperature on development of populations of the rice stem borer from Hsilo (23.8°N), Tounan (23.7°N) and Pingtong (22.7°N), Taiwan, was investigated. The development rates of these populations increased with increasing temperature from 20 to 30°C. The mean developmental periods of eggs, larvae, and male and female pupae in the Hsilo population were 7.7, 33.0, 7.6 and 7.1 days at 25°C under 14L : 10D photoperiod and the theoretical threshold temperatures for development were 8.9, 9.2, 10.4 and 10.5°C, respectively. Effective temperature sums for development were 124, 521, 111 and 103 day-degrees, respectively. These results suggest in Hsilo population that 4 or 5 generations occur annually in central and southern Taiwan. In the Tounan and Pingtong populations, which require lower effective temperature sums for larval development than the Hsilo population, 5 or 6 generations may occur in a year.

Direct sulfation of ecdysone afforded a mixture of various sulfates. Regioselective sulfation of ecdysone was achieved by utilizing temporary protection of hydroxy groups. The chromatographic behaviour of synthetic sulfates was compared with that of various other polar conjugates of ecdysone and 20-hydroxyecdysone. General rules to characterise ecdysteroid conjugates are proposed.

N2  - Fourth-instar gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar; Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) larvae, infected with the gypsy moth baculovirus (LdNPV), show an elevated and prolonged extension of the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer peak associated with molting. The ecdysteroid immunoreactivity associated with this peak elutes as two peaks following HPLC on a C18  reverse-phase column. Both peaks elute in a region more polar than 20-hydroxyecdysone, but less polar than the highly polar ecdysteroid immunoreactivity associated with the apolysis peak of control animals. Glycosylated ecdysteroid standards, produced by in vitro incubation of UDP-glucose with ecdysone or 20-hydroxyecdysone and culture medium from LdNPV-infected gypsy moth cells, show elution times identical to the two immunoreactive peaks. Enzymatic hydrolysis studies verified this identity. The data suggest that the hemolymph of LdNPV-infected L. dispar larvae contains both glucose-conjugated ecdysone and glucose-conjugated 20-hydroxyecdysone which, by analogy with the literature, are presumably 22-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 20-hydroxyecdysone 22-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside.

N2  - 3-Dehydroecdysone (3DE) is the major secretory product of crayfish moulting glands. The metabolic fate of 3DE in the crayfish Orconectes limosus was investigated after in vivo injection of [3H]3DE and after incubation of various tissues with [3H]3DE in vitro. Metabolites in whole body and tissue extracts were analysed by HPLC. In vivo [3H]3DE is efficiently reduced and hydroxylated to [3H]20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), which is one of the major metabolites observed in our study and also the major circulating ecdysteroid. 3 beta-reduction and 20-hydroxylation were the predominant enzymatic activities obtained after in vitro incubation of [3H]3DE with various tissues. Under the conditions utilised here, antennal glands and CNS (abdominal ganglia) exhibited highest reductase activity per mg wet weight; epidermis, gonads, midgut gland and hindgut had moderate activities; muscle had the least and hemolymph was inactive. 3DE conversion by Y-organs differed moulting stage dependently. 20-hydroxylation activities were similarly distributed in all organs except for ovaries, in which 20-hydroxylation exceeded the 3 beta-reduction. Ovaries were also the only tissue containing a significant 3 alpha-reductase activity.

N2  - Three new antisera have been produced in rabbits immunized with E-2/3-hemisuccinate conjugates. In a competitive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with 20-ecdysone-peroxidase as a tracer, the antisera exhibit high specificity towards the side chain of the ecdysone (E) molecule. Modifications of the A-ring do result in no or small changes of sensitivity. One antiserum (RUD-2) allows the direct quantification of total ecdysteroids in samples containing E and 3-dehydroecdysone in varying ratios, without further sophisticated sample treatment. At least one of the other antisera allows the direct quantification of mixtures of E and 25-deoxyecdysone (RUD-1). Thus, these antisera may be a useful tool in studying molting control in arthropods.

N2  - Female penultimate instar larvae of Gryllus bimaculatus show a maximum in haemolymph ecdysteroid titer as well as in hormone release in vitro by prothoracic glands on day 4, two days before final larval moult. Ovary and abdominal integument of the larvae contain considerable amounts of ecdysteroids, but no significant hormone release is detectable during a 16 h in vitro incubation of these tissues. In last instar larvae, the prothoracic glands reach their maximal ecdysteroid release on day 5. This peak is followed by a maximal release of hormones by the ovary as well as by the abdominal integument on day 6. The highest titer of ecdysteroids in haemolymph is found on day 7, two days before imaginal moult. The haemolymph titer is governed only by free ecdysteroids. The prothoracic glands and the abdominal integument release free ecdysteroids, whereas from the ovary considerable quantities of apolar conjugates appear. The abdominal integument of day 6 last instar larvae converts [3H]5 beta-ketodiol into [3H]ecdysone in vitro.From these results it can be concluded that in last instar larvae of G. bimaculatus the prothoracic gland as well as the ovary and the abdominal integument are involved in the changes of haemolymph ecdysteroid titer in relation to imaginal moulting. The data indicate an ecdysteroid synthesis outside the prothoracic gland in G. bimaculatus last instar larvae.

N2  - The developmental fluctuations in immunoreactive ecdysteroids in the haemolymph of adult female Blattella germanica (L.) are reported. There is a relatively low titre in freshly ecdysed females, an increase during vitellogenesis to a peak at choriogenesis, and a decrease after ovulation. These fluctuations parallel those of ecdysteroid content in the ovary. In addition, haemolymph ecdysteroid levels are reduced following ovariectomy, and single ovarioles incubated in vitro effectively release ecdysteroids into the medium. The data strongly suggest that the ovaries are a major source of circulating ecdysteroids in adult females of this species. Since the prothoracic gland degenerates shortly after the imaginal moult, the presence of ecdysteroids in the haemolymph of ovariectomized females suggests that there are other tissues that also serve as a source of these circulating hormones during the reproductive cycle of B. germanica.

N2  - Pycnogonum litorale (Ström) is a primitive marine chelicerate. When mechanically irritated, it discharges a mixture of eight ecdysteroids (ES) that acts as a chemical defense against predatory decapod crustaceans. Injection of [3H]-20-hydroxyecdysone into the hemolymph or into the gut and subsequent autoradiography of frozen sections revealed that the majority of the ES in the pycnogonids is concentrated in epidermal glands. A novel autoradiographic technique for the localization of water soluble radioactive substances at uneven surfaces visualized the ES secretion through cuticular pores. Scanning electron microscopy shows that each pore is associated with a forked seta, which is suspected to have mechanoreceptory functions. The epidermal glands, numbering 10,000 to 20,000 in adults, are distributed on all parts of the body, except the arthrodial membranes. Thus, this system provides an effective allround defense against predators. Similar pores occur in many pycnogonid species, and it is suggested that chemical defense might be a common feature within the entire class of pycnogonids.

N2  - The head is traditionally considered to be the site of production and release of the egg development neurosecretory hormone (EDNH), involved in ovarian maturation in dipterans. We find, however, that the thorax and abdomen of the mosquito Aedes aegypti each possess factors which resemble EDNH in both physiological and biochemical properties. Extracts of thoraces or abdomens each stimulated the dose-dependent appearance of ecdysteroid in incubations of A. aegypti ovaries in vitro. In addition, each extract is capable of stimulating ovarian maturation in vivo in decapitated Aedes atropalpus. The head contains higher levels of activity, absolute and specific, than either the thorax or abdomen, but extracts of all three body portions yield similar chromatographic patterns of activity. Gonadotropic activity in all three extracts elutes in two molecular weight ranges, large (approx. 6,600–7,700 MW) and small (approx. 4,150–4,250 MW). In each tissue, the small molecular weight component is more active than the large component. The roles of these non-cerebral ecdysiotropins and gonadotropins are not clear, but their similarities to cerebral EDNH suggest a function in ovarian maturation.

N2  - Using an in vitro prothoracic gland assay (PTG) to assess production of ecdysteroids, a low molecular weight ecdysiotropin(s) (500–1,500 daltons) was detected in proctodaea (hindguts) of unparasitized and parasitized Manduca sexta 5th instars. Dose-response curves for the three groups of insects tested were similar with maximum stimulation being observed in PTGs incubated with 0.00125–0.005 organ equivalent. However, when results were adjusted for differences in wet weight of the proctodaea, extracts from hosts which initially were parasitized in the first instar, possessed 2.6 times more ecdysiotropic activity than extracts from day-3 unparasitized 5th instars and 1.8 times more activity than extracts from day-1 unparasitized 5th instars. These results suggest that the parasite may be able to regulate the synthesis and/or release of its host\'s proctodaeal ecdysiotropin(s) possibly as a strategy of host regulation to facilitate meeting its own developmental requirements.

N2  - Fluctuations of low molecular weight (500–1,500 daltons) ecdysiotropin titers in the hemolymph of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, and of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, were measured. For hemolymph from nondiapause-bound European corn borer 5th instars, dose/response curves suggest that there exist at least two ecdysiotropins capable of stimulating prothoracic glands to produce ecdysteroid, one (ECTR I) with maximum activity at 0.5 µl hemolymph/25 µl drop of incubation medium and one (ECTR II) with maximum activity at 4 µl hemolymph/25 µl drop of incubation medium. ECTR I was detected on days 2, 3 and 4 of the 5th instar while ECTR II was detected throughout the 5th instar and also in the hemolymph of pharate pupae and day-1 pupae. Hemolymph of diapause-bound 5th instars also possessed ecdysiotropic activity. Considerably more ecdysiotropin was detected on days 1 through 5 of these diapause-bound 5th instars than on days 7 through 24. Dose/response curves for hemolymph from fifth instar L. dispar also suggest that there are at least two ecdysiotropins present. Extracts of hindguts (proctodaea) of O. nubilalis and of L. dispar have been reported to contain low molecular weight ecdysiotropins that stimulate the in vitro production of ecdysteroid by prothoracic glands. It is possible that the source of one or both of the newly discovered hemolymph ecdysiotropins is the proctodaeum.

N2  - Trypsin Modulating Oostatic Factor (TMOF) of the grey fleshfly Neobellieria bullata is a hexapeptide that has been isolated from vitellogenic ovaries. Its precursor is a 75 kDa protein that is abundantly present in oocytes but absent from hemolymph. TMOF inhibits trypsin biosynthesis in the gut, it lowers yolk polypeptide concentration in the hemolymph and strongly inhibits ecdysone biosynthesis by larval ring glands. Evidence is presented that a molecule with identical chromatographic behaviour and physiological effects is also present in the larvae of Neobellieria at the time when they stop feeding, Ecdysone inhibition does not suppress trypsin modulating activity of the hexapeptide. This, in combination with results that were obtained with four slightly different TMOF analogs, suggests that the inhibitory activity of trypsin biosynthesis is independent from that of ecdysone regulation. Several compounds that were tested for initiation or increase in trypsin biosynthesis in the gut were not active.

N2  - The silkworm, Bombyx mori was reared on artificial diets supplemented with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) during the 4th instar and on diets supplemented with various concentrations of either 20E or ecdysone (E) in the 5th (last) instar. The larvae transferred to diet containing E molted to the 6th instar earlier than the control larvae and their mortality was within norm. On the other hand, most of the larvae that were transferred to the diet supplemented with 300 ppm 20E continued to feed until they died without apolysis. The amount of 20E in their hemolymph was higher than in the larvae fed 200 ppm E. Larvae transferred to a diet containing both E and 20E did enter apolysis and their ecdysteroid level was similar as in the non-molting larvae receiving 300 ppm 20E. These results suggest that ingested ecdysone might change the sensitivity of epidermis to 20E.

N2  - The synthesis of dopamine melanin in the wing scales of Precis coenia depends on pattern specific activity of dopa decarboxylase (DDC) at the end of pupal development when hemolymph ecdysteroids decrease. DDC activity in forewings increased in 6 days old pupae and is maximal on day 6 at midnight. DDC activity increased also in isolated wings incubated in Grace\'s medium on day 5 at midnight, following the same time profile as in vivo. The wings developed their typical colour pattern. However, at most time points DDC activity in vitro was lower than in vivo. Wings incubated in medium containing 10 µg/ml 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) did not melanize. 20E inhibited the DDC activity in a dose dependent manner. A new technique was used to continuously supply 20E to an almost intact pupa. The pupal cuticle covering the left forewing was removed and the wing was hung in medium containing different concentrations of 20E. 20E was distributed in the pupa and inhibited melanization in the intact right pupal wing. In control incubations with pure Grace\'s medium different coloured portions of the wing pattern showed different DDC activities being high in the black eyespot and medium and low in grey and white wing pieces, respectively. A high concentration of 10 µg/ml 20E supplied to the left wing totally inhibited DDC in all differently coloured wing pieces. With decreasing ecdysteroid concentrations, DDC activity increased earlier and to higher levels in black than in grey wing pieces and was almost constant in white pieces. Therefore, melanin synthesis started earlier and was at a higher level in black than in grey scales, which caused their different pigmentation. This result suggests that the time point of initial melanin synthesis in differently melanized scales is triggered by the decreasing ecdysteroid titer causing differential activation of the DDC.

N2  - We are interested in identifying members of the generic pathway through which 20-hydroxyecdysone (20HE) mediates reorganization of the central nervous system (CNS) during metamorphosis. Our entry point is the Drosophila Broad-Complex (BR-C), an early 20HE-inducible locus with three genetic subfunctions, each represented by a lethal complementation group. Our previous analysis of mutants demonstrated that all three BR-C subfunctions are necessary for CNS morphogenesis and one is essential for visual system organization. We believe the mutant phenotypes result from faulty expression of genes normally regulated by the BRC family of zinc-finger proteins. BRC target genes are predicted to have expression patterns and/or mutant phenotypes that partially overlap with those of the BR-C. We have examined two candidate genes, IMP-E1 and Deformed (Dfd), to determine their positions relative to BR-C in the hormone-regulated pathway of CNS metamorphosis. Identified by Natzle and colleagues on the basis of 20HE-inducibility in imaginal discs, IMP-EI transcripts were also found in a subset of CNS glial cells. Our recent experiments show that BR-C expression is spatially and temporally poised to regulate IMP-E1 induction by 20HE. We examined IMP-E1 transcript accumulation in larval and prepupal CNS of BR-C lethal mutants representing each of the three complementation groups. In all three cases, IMP-E1 induction in the CNS of BR-C mutants was comparable to that of wildtype and of genetic controls. Thus, activity of any individual BR-C subfunction is not essential for IMP-E1 induction. Dfd is a homeotic selector gene in the Antennapedia complex whose larval CNS expression has been shown by others to be restricted to a subset of subesophageal ganglion cells. We have demonstrated that Dfd mutants manifest a defect in subesophageal ganglion metamorphosis, namely separation from the thoracic ganglion, indistinguishable from that of BR-C mutants. However, Dfd transcript accumulation in the CNS appears to be indifferent to 20HE levels in vivo or in vitro. Alternative models for the genetic pathways controlling CNS metamorphosis are discussed.

N2  - Radiotracer experiments were performed to analyze the interaction of metabolites of ecdysone with proteins in adult Drosophila melanogaster females. [3H]Ecdysone was injected into the abdomen and after 4 h of incubation the flies were dissected. PBS-soluble material of the ovaries, haemolymph, gut and abdominal carcass were separated by gel-filtration. In all samples, two peaks containing radioactivity eluted with macromolecules (probably proteins) of an apparent molecular mass of more than 1,000 kDa (peak I) and about 500 kDa (peak II). In the extracts of the ovaries an additional peak in the molecular weight range of about 50 kDa (peak III) was detected. In all samples free ecdysone metabolites, which did not interact with macromolecules were detected. The radioactivity in the ovary-specific peak III was mainly due to ecdysone 22-phosphate. The high molecular weight peak I contained radioactive 22-fatty acyl esters of ecdysone and the radioactive material of peak II consisted of a highly complex mixture of ecdysteroids.

N2  - The influence of ovary and ecdysteroids on pheromone biosynthesis was investigated in D. melanogaster. Strains mutant for ovo produced enhanced amounts of cuticular hydrocarbons in both sexes. Female sex pheromone production was not affected by the mutation, except homozygous females for ovoDlrsl which exhibited a higher proportion of the pheromone, 7,11 heptacosadiene. The amount of hydrocarbons in wild-type (CS) flies was stable at 21 and 25°C but dramatically increased at 29°C whereas the cuticular hydrocarbon pattern was unchanged. In contrast, ecdysone-less 1ls (ecd-1) flies showed an increase in overall hydrocarbon production at both permissive and restrictive temperatures. At restrictive temperature they showed also a decrease in pheromonal dienes production for females with an increase in monoenes and an inversion of the 7 tricosene-7 pentacosene ratio for males. These effects were partially reversible since a switch from 29 to 21°C restored an intermediary hydrocarbon pattern.It is suggested that the regulation of female sex pheromone might be under the control of the ecd-1 gene.

Similarly, a downregulation of the inducibility of a diptericin reporter transgene is observed in the pupae of transgenic Drosophila, indicating existence of a negative correlation between inducibility and ecdysteroid titre. In the present paper we show that the level of antibacterial activity induced by the injection of bacteria into the diapausing larvae of Calliphora is reduced if the insects simultaneously receive 20-hydroxyecdysone. The same effect is observed in ligated Calliphora larvae deprived of their brain-retrocerebral complex. The data suggest that at certain developmental stages ecdysteroids downregulate the induced antibacterial defense.

N2  - We have previously isolated from the beetle Tenebrio molitor, cDNAs coding for two glycine-rich cuticular proteins named ACP-20, ACP-22 and ACP-17 and an alanin-rich cuticular protein named LPCP-22. The ACP-20, ACP-22, ACP-17 mRNAs are detected by Northern blot and in situ hybridization analysis only in epidermal regions secreting heavily sclerotized cuticle during the pharate adult stage. The LPCP-22 mRNA is detected in most epidermal regions during the secretion of larval and pupal cuticles. Then, its presence is restricted to the epidermal zones secreting intersegmental soft cuticle in the newly ecdysed pupa. This stage- and tissue-specific gene system seems to be a convenient model for studying the regulation of sequential gene expression by ecdysteroids and juvenile hormone.

N2  - During the final larval instar of the blowfly Calliphora vicina the storage protein arylphorin is stage-specifically produced and re-absorbed by the fat body cells. In this study the hormonal regulation of arylphorin biosynthesis and endocytosis has been investigated in vitro and in vivo. Application of 10 to 50 ng 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in vivo or of 10–7 to 10–6 M 20E in vitro specifically inhibits arylphorin translation without altering the arylphorin mRNA level. After termination of arylphorin synthesis in vivo, it can be artificially re-induced by neck-ligation, an effect which can be reversed by application of 50 ng 20E. This suggests that the small rise in titre of 20E at the end of feeding stage is responsible for the inhibition of arylphorin-mRNA translation in vivo. 20E stage-specifically stimulates arylphorin uptake by the larval fat body in vitro, as well as in vivo (Burmester & Scheller, in prep.). We assume two defined but different post-translational effects of 20E on arylphorin metabolism.

N2  - Developmental profiles of total RNA and four silk protein mRNAs exhibit different correlations with ecdysteroid titre changes in course of the 180 hr-long last larval instar. Total RNA and heavy-chain fibroin mRNA increase gradually until 168 hr and 156 hr, respectively, dropping sharply afterwards. The content of sericin1 mRNA rises for 120 hr, remains high until 168 hr and then drops. The amounts of ligh-chain fibroin mRNA and sericin2 mRNA increase sharply at the start of the instar; the former rises until 168 hr, whereas the latter begins to decline already at 120 hr. The pupation-inducing ecdysteroid surge at 144–168 hr causes a drop in all examined RNA classes. Similar drop is induced precociously with exogenous ecdysterone, while a slow decrease of RNA contents to similar bottom levels occurs when the larvae are ligated behind prothorax.

N2  - In response to a blood meal, the fat body of the female mosquito produces several yolk proteins (YP) which are accumulated by the developing oocytes. 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) stimulates high levels of YP gene expression in fat bodies cultured in vitro, but initiation of this expression was eliminated with cycloheximide. In the 1.5 kb upstream region of the gene encoding vitellogenic carboxypeptidase, a mosquito YP, there are several putative regulatory sequences that resemble steroid response elements (SRE), but they do not match the ecdysteroid response element (EcRE) consensus. A cDNA encoding a mosquito ecdysteroid receptor (AaEcR) has recently been cloned and found to possess P-Box and D-Box domains nearly identical to those found in the Drosophila and Chironomus EcRs, indicating that its DNA binding sequence will likely match the EcRE consensus. Taken together, these results indicate that the control of YP genes in the vitellogenic mosquito fat body by 20E is indirect. It may involve several factors in a hierarchy, with a factor other than the AaEcR directly controlling the YP genes. In the mosquito fat body, lysosomal enzymes are involved in termination of YP secretion. The mRNA of a mosquito lysosomal aspartic protease (LAP) reaches its peak 12 hr before the peak of LAP protein and enzymatic activity. The level of LAP protein rises as the titer of 20E declines. This suggests a translational inhibition of LAP mRNA by a high titer of 20E. We obtained direct experimental confirmation of this novel function of 20E. In addition, the 5\'-untranslated region of the LAP mRNA shares similarity with elements conferring negative translational control by steroids. The LAP gene is controlled by dual promoters, one of which is dominant during enhanced expression. The identification of putative regulatory elements should help in determining the regulation of the gene during both housekeeping and enhanced expression.

N2  - Chromatography of nuclear extracts from Calliphora vicina on heparin-agarose separates two fractions binding ponasterone A. One does not bind calf-thymus (ct) DNA, has a molecular mass of 100 kDa, and may represent an ecdysteroid receptor monomer. The other binds to ctDNA and is 180 kDa, indicating this to be a receptor complex of two or more heteromeric partners. The formation of this DNA-binding complex is promoted by the presence of high-affinity ligand and of DNA itself.

N2  - An ecdysteroid receptor protein has been identified and characterized from whole body extracts of Chironomus thummi larvae. The kinetic and physical characteristics of this binding are consistent with the criteria established for steroid hormone receptors and are similar to those exhibited by the Drosophila ecdysteroid receptor. The binding data of cytosols obtained from different developmental stages (third and fourth stage larvae, pupae and adults) indicate only a single type of binding site which exists throughout the life cycle of the insect with an average Kd value of 5 × 10–9 mol/g of protein. Furthermore, single point determinations of the receptor concentration at these stages revealed that the receptor level fluctuates. This fluctuation in the receptor level corresponds well to the fluctuation in the ecdysteroid titer indicating that the number of receptors at any particular stage of development may be regulated by the presence of the moulting hormone.

N2  - Intermoult puffs constitute the first set of ecdysone-responsive puffs detected on salivary gland chromosomes of D. melanogaster third instar larave. In order to analyse the hormonal regulation of this puff set we have investigated the genetic regulatory hierarchy governing the expression of three genes mapping at the 3C polytene region, from which one of the most prominent intermoult puff originates. The results obtained reveal that the expression of the genes studied, named ng-1, ng-2 and ng-3, is coordinate and specifically restricted to the Puffing Stage 1 (PS 1). The repression of these genes appears to be related to the PS1/PS2 transition and is dependent on the activity of the ecdysone induced BR-C locus. While the ng-gene repression results to be a secondary response to ecdysone, the recent identification of functional EcREs within the ng-1,2 coding region suggests that the induction of ng-genes might be part of the early ecdysone primary response at the beginning of the third larval instar.

N2  - We review data on the structure and expression of the Broad Complex, a key gene in the response to ecdysterone (20E) in Drosophila cells. The 2B3-7 X chromosome region, containing an early (20E) inducible puff, was saturated with mutations in the genes dor, hfw (swi) and BR-C that cause disturbances in the normal ecdysterone-inducible puffing sequence. By analysis of chromosome rearrangements localized on the genetic, cytological and physical maps, the BR-C locus has been mapped exactly within the 2B3-5 puff. Homozygous mutations for BR-C result in the multiple distortions of metamorphosis and female fertility due to loss of sensitivity of the genes in this chromosomal region to ecdysteroids.Using interstrain larval ovary transplantation, the causes of female sterility were studied in females mutant for the BR-C. Transplantation of BR-C ovaries into females heterozygous for a dominant sterility mutation followed by genetic analysis of the progeny demonstrated that the transplanted ovaries were capable of normal function. The sterility of the BR-C mutant females is therefore associated with a somatic extra-ovarial defect rather than a germ line malfunction.According to cytogenetic and molecular analysis, the BR-C occupies more than 115 kb and contains at least three regulatory elements. One of these elements (in position 146.5–161 kb) may respond to 20E and this results in puff activation in the salivary gland cells. The second element (at 99–120 kb) is located upstream in the first exon and is necessary for transcription activation, while the third element (to the left of 99 kb) is necessary for normal fertility.The strongest BR-C mutations result in underdevelopment of almost all ecdysterone-inducible puffs. In animals homozygous for the weaker BR-C mutations (rbp group) which survive until organ formation in the pupa, the larval salivary glands do not histolyse until at least 72 hour after pupariation (Restifo & White, 1992). Analysis of polytene chromosomes has shown that in the rbp4 mutant all ecdysterone-inducible puffs are extremely reduced in 0, 3, and 10 h prepupae. Some of the puffs including the 2B3-5 are active until 24 h pupae.

N2  - A strategy is described for receptor-based phytochemical screening of plant extracts for ecdysteroid agonists and antagonists. Milligram amounts of seed are methanol extracted. Lipids and pigments are removed by hexane partioning. Agonist and antagonist activities are detected with a microplate-based specific bioassay using the Drosophila melanogaster ecdysteroid-responsive BII cell line. Extracts are also screened with ecdysteroid-specific RIAs to identify extracts containing phytoecdysteroids. Over 1,700 species of plant have been screened in this way so far. Extracts are being sought which (i) contain large amounts of phytoecdysteroid, (ii) which contain novel phytoecdysteroids, (iii) which contain non-steroidal agonists and (iv) which contain antagonists. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale behind the strategy, to describe its operation and to present, as an example, the results obtained with members of the Poaceae and of one genus, Briza, in particular. It is hoped that this approach will result in the identification of new sources of phytoecdysteroids, provide new phytoecdysteroid structures for structure/activity relationship studies, throw light on the phylogenetic distribution of phytoecdysteroids in the plant kingdom and provide useful agonists and antagonists for the investigation of ecdysteroid receptor function and as potential lead compounds for new classes of insect control agents.

N2  - Radioimmunoassay was used to quantify the levels of ecdysteroids in extracts of portions of single plants of several members of the Chenopodiaceae. Species were chosen because previous studies had shown that seeds of these species were ecdysteroid-containing and because they represent several tribes within the Chenopodiaceae. Total ecdysteroid levels varied considerably between species and between different parts of the same plant. Phytoecdysteroid-containing members of the genus Chenopodium appear to possess the same distribution as previously found for C. album, as does Spinacia oleracea. Rhagodia candolleana is characterized by very high levels of ecdysteroids, with the highest levels being associated with newly developing side-shoots. Preliminary data for Beta patellaris reveal high levels associated with the lower portions of the plant and rapidly increasing levels associated with the reproductive tissues during flowering and fruiting, to give the high levels previously found to be associated with the seed. Taken together these data tend to support a role for phytoecdysteroids in insect deterrence, but the situation is complex, probably reflecting the subtle interplay between the plant and detrimental/beneficial insects which has occurred during evolution.

N2  - After the transformation of stems with Agrobacterium rhizogenes, hairy root cultures have been obtained from Serratula tinctoria (Asteraceae), a plant containing very high amounts of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and numerous other phytoecdysteroids. These cultures were found to grow regularly in vitro, either in liquid or solid media, and to maintain a high ecdysteroid production (c.a. 0.1–0.2% dry weight). 20E was the predominant ecdysteroid, together with the corresponding 3-acetate (20E3Ac). Ecdysteroids were not secreted in the medium but remained in root tissues. Moreover, a concentration gradient was observed in transformed hairy roots, as in plant roots, characterized by a higher ecdysteroid content in the meristematic zone. In vitro incubations with two radiolabelled precursors, [3H]-cholesterol and [14C]-mevalonic acid, have been performed, showing an efficient incorporation of these molecules into ecdysteroids: with labelled cholesterol, 20E indeed reached 0.25 to 0.67% of the radioactivity recovered in hairy roots after several days of culture and, with labelled mevalonate, 0.4 to 2.7%. Thus, hairy roots of S. tinctoria undoubtedly constitute a very promising tool for the analysis of ecdysteroid biosynthesis and functions in plants.

N2  - Insect moulting hormone, 20-hydroxyecdysone or ecdysterone (E), was tested in a series of bioassays that are commonly used for evaluation of the activity of phytohormones. The assays included: auxin coleoptile bioassay in wheat, gibberellin bioassays in dwarf maize and dwarf rice; cytokinin bioassay on tobacco callus; brassinolide related ethylene formation assay in dwarf maize, alfalfa and Chenopodium, flowering assay on Chenopodium and special assay on somatic embryogenesis in cell cultures of alfalfa. The 20-hydroxyecdysone has no biological activity in tests used for detecting phytohormone activity, excepting for slight gibberellin-like activity in rice. Moreover, E does not have any synergistic or antagonistic activity. In tissue cultures of alfalfa, E affected differentiation of the embryos. It is concluded that, in spite of its widespread occurrence in plants, E has no direct action on growth and proliferation of plant tissues (which is the main action of E in arthropods). However, E and other ecdysteroids could provide a source of easily available, slightly polar, polyhydroxylated sterol, required for growth and cell proliferation in plants.

N2  - Effects of the synthetic ecdysone agonists RH-5849 and RH-5992 have been compared with the action of 20-hydroxyecdysone in several standard bioassays that are currently used for determination of the moulting hormone activity. In the assay on ligated larvae of Galleria, these synthetic hormone mimics, ecdysoids according to the endocrinological terminology, stimulated the extra-larval moult cycles with all developmental consequences similar to the action of 20-hydroxyecdysone. The ED-50 dosages were 1.3 µg for 20-hydroxyecdysone, 1.75 µg for RH-5849 and 0.9 µg/specimen for RH-5992. In the assays on diapausing pupae of Manduca and Pieris, RH-5849 also duplicated the developmental stimulation of 20-hydroxyecdysone at lower concentrations (in Manduca, ED-50 1.2 µg/spec. for RH-5849, 1.9 µg for 20-hydroxyecdysone; in Pieris, ED-50 0.013 µg for RH-5849, 0.1 µg for 20-hydroxyecdysone). When compared with 20-hydroxyecdysone, the ecdysoids caused pathophysiological symptoms of hyper-ecdysonismm or neurotoxic action at much lower concentrations, corresponding to the bottom of the dose-response curves. Both the ecdysoids were completely ineffective in the standard assays on ligated larvae of Sarcophaga and Calliphora and they were equally inactive in all methods of topical application that have been used. In special assays on larvae of Galleria, the ecdysoid RH-5849 exhibited definite synergistic action with 20-hydroxyecdysone, there was no antagonism. The results confirm previous conclusions that these synthetic ecdysoids act directly at the peripheral tissue targets. The reasons in favour and against a hypothesis that they would act by inducing endogenous ecdysteroid synthesis in the target cells has been discussed.

N2  - The non-steroidal ecdysone agonist, RH-5992, is effective in inducing an incomplete molt in the spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens), only when it is fed to the larvae prior to the appearance of the endogenous ecdysteroid peak. When this compound is administered after the ecdysteroid peak, the larvae molt normally into the next stage. However, because of its persistence, the agonist induces an incomplete molt in the subsequent larval stage. The effect does not appear to be due to ecdysone responsive tissues becoming refractory after the ecdysteroid peak. Choristoneura hormone receptor 3 (CHR3), a homologue of Manduca hormone receptor 3 (MHR3), is induced in the epidermis, fat body and midgut of 6th instar larvae treated with RH-5992 during all days of the 6th stadium. Possible reasons for this age specific effect are discussed.

N2  - The effects of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), ponasterone A (PoA) and both dibenzoylhydrazine-based ecdysteroid agonists RH-5849 and RH-5992, were tested on in vitro-cultured imaginal wing discs of last-instar larvae of the beet armyworm, Spodoptera exigua (Hübner). In each case, the response was qualitatively similar to that induced by 20E, although the concentrations required to induce response varied widely. The EC50 of both ecdysteroids 20E and PoA to elicit wing disc evagination in 50% of the discs was 89.8 and 2.57 nM, respectively; for both nonsteroid agonists RH-5849 and RH-5992 this was 870 and 11.7 nM, respectively. Binding competition studies using whole imaginal wing discs, showed that I50 of 20E, PoA, RH-5849 and RH-5992 to displace 50% of [3H]PoA-binding was 290, 7, 1100 and 33 nM, respectively, which is in the same order as the respective concentration to elicit a biological response.

N2  - The two nonsteroidal ecdysteroid agonists, RH 5849 and RH 5992 were tested in the epithelial cell line from Chironomus tentans. Both compounds induce all effects elicited by 20-OH-ecdysone in this cell line, namely differentiation, arrest of cell growth and regulation of chitin metabolism. Usually, the cell line forms multicellular vesicles consisting of a squamous monolayer. Treatment with ecdysteroids or RH compounds leads to the formation of a stratified columnar epithelium. This differentiation is accompanied by changes in protein pattern. Ecdysteroids and RH compounds also interfere with chitin metabolism. Chitin synthesis is inhibited, whereas synthesis and secretion of chitinolytic enzymes are increased. The efficiency of RH 5849, RH 5992 and 20-OH-ecdysone to evoke the above mentioned responses corresponds with their affinity for the ecdysteroid receptor.

N2  - Freshly hatched Japanese quails of the strain Faraon were fed for 50 days by diets containing graded amounts of pulverized seeds of an Asiatic plant Leuzea carthamoides Iljin. The dry seeds of this plant contained 1.8%–2.1% of 20-hydroxyecdysone, together with some smaller amounts of other ecdysteroids. In additional experiments the quails were also offered the standard diet plus whole seeds of Leuzea ad libitum and the standard diet enriched with certain commercially available biostimulating preparations for birds, Biostrong and Ecovit. The effects of the diets were evaluated first at the age of 37 days and then at the age of 50 days, which covered the reproduction period. Investigations related to the effects on growth, behaviour and overall developmental conditions were completed by RIA analysis of ecdysteroid concentrations circulating in the blood of the quails.The basic experimental series involved testing of the following diets: 0) Standard diet (SD); 1) SD + 0.2% Leuzea seed; 2) SD + 1.0% Leuzea; 3) SD + 5.0% Leuzea; 4) SD + 5.0% Biostrong; 5) SD + 3.0% Ecovit, and; 6) SD + the whole seeds of Leuzea ad libitum. At the age of 37 days we found the following percentage increase of the living mass (Control group = 100%): 1) 102.8%; 2) 109.5%; 3) 120.4%; 4) 101.9%; 5) 104.9%:, and 6) 103.5%. These results confirm previous findings of strong anabolic effects of Leuzea in growth of the vertebrate animals. However, since the plant contains a number of other biologically active classes of the secondary plant substances, the true responsibility of ecdysteroids for the described effects cannot be guaranteed, without further studies with pure ecdysteroid. The results of RIA analyses revealed that the amount of 20-hydroxyecdysone circulating in the blood of Japanese quails was directly proportional to the amount of dietary ecdysteroid. The largest concentrations, around 80 ng/ml of blood were found in quails which consumed the whole seeds of Leuzea.

Chinese hamster ovary cells have been stably transfected with the beta-actin promoter construct. Antiserum, prepared against an EcR-fusion protein has been used to demonstrate the synthesis of an apparently complete ecdysone receptor in a stable cell line produced in this way. Nuclear extracts from this line exhibit specific binding activity for the D. melanogaster hsp 27 ecdysone response element in mobility shift analyses. Ecdysteroid induction of reporter gene activity has been demonstrated in Chinese hamster ovary cells both by transient transfection analysis and in stably transfected cell lines which constitutively produce the D. melanogaster ecdysone receptor.

The 10% diet, which is preferable from both health and economical viewpoints, stimulated the growth of testes, while the body growth curve was similar to that of animals fed on a conventional diet. The diet with 20% Rhaponticum resulted in high variability of the weight of testes. Effects of tested diets on the body weight and food consumption were different in males and females.

N2  - Experiments with the aphid Megoura viciae Buckton were directed toward quantitative analysis of the cumulative effects of different long- and short-day photoperiods, as dependent on the numbers of light-dark cycles. It has been shown that the accumulation of these effects is a nonlinear process since, as the number of the cycles experienced increases, this process gradually slows down and finally stops. From this observation a suggestion was derived that the kinetics of the cumulative effects depends on interaction of two opposite processes, viz. the increase of the effect due to summation of consecutive daily impulses (induction), and its spontaneous decrease due to degradation (deinduction). The dependence of the kinetics of the cumulative effect on the rates of induction and deinduction was analyzed in the framework of a model proposed earlier. Incorporation of these parameters into the model produced feasible explanations for (a) the compatibility of the quantitative perception of photoperiod with the evident \'\'all-or-nothing\'\' overt responses; (b) the dynamics of switches caused by photoperiod reversals, and (c) other aspects of insect photoperiodism. Since temperature coefficients of both parameters may be unequal, the outcome of interaction between induction and deinduction may be different at different temperatures. This provided novel explanations (1) of the well known variations in interaction between the photoperiodic and temperature reactions and (2) of the promotion of development in diapausing insects by chilling.

N2  - The flight activity of C. septempunctata was examined in a mixed oak forest, North Hungary, in 1987–1988. Malaise traps were established at the shrub level (0–2 m), the canopy level (12.5–14.5 m) and above the forest (25–27 m). A fourth trap was placed in an open grassland 200 m from the forest edge at the ground level. Exact meteorological data were registered during the season. The highest flight activity was observed in late July – early August in both years. This period fits to the migration period of C. septempunctata to hibernation sites. In this period a \'\'long distance flight behaviour\'\' was observed in the high strata of the forest. The meteorological conditions highly influenced the flight activity of beetles, especially in the canopy level. In 1987, long distance flight behaviour was almost completely absent due to the low temperature and high wind speed.

N2  - The ovipositional patterns of Sitophilus granarius females have been studied over time, and in response to different numbers of available wheat grains. The female fecundity and the degree of grain infestation show a maximum by 20th day of adult life, and a significant decrease after 30th day. Increasing grain availability leads to a rise of both female fecundity and grain infestation, until saturation is reached. The frequency distribution of the numbers of eggs per grain shows a contagious pattern due to a tendency of females to lay more than one egg within the same grain. This behaviour is independent of female age and grain availability, and consequently the possibility that it may be an adaptive reproductive strategy is discussed.

N2  - Developmental interactions between the solitary koinobiont endoparasitoid Venturia canescens, and two of its hosts, the pyralid moths Plodia interpunctella and Corcyra cephalonica, were investigated. Wasps reared from second (L2) through fifth (L5) instars of Corcyra were larger than those from the corresponding stages of Plodia, but took longer to complete development and generally suffered higher mortality. Starved L5 Plodia of a given mass produced significantly larger wasps than starved L5 Corcyra. Adult wasp size was positively correlated with the number of ovulated eggs in Venturia emerging from both hosts; thus, the larger wasps that emerged from Corcyra had higher egg complements than the smaller wasps from Plodia. The final size of parasitized L2–L4 Corcyra was influenced by Venturia, with all three instars significantly smaller than unparasitized larvae. For Venturia, developmental flexibility and host regulation are important adaptive mechanisms that allow the parasitoid to develop in a wide range of host instars. However, for koinobiont parasitoids differences in the biology of the host species strongly influence their development and fitness.

N2  - The proportion of melanic (with dark elytra) and non-melanic (yellow-brown elytra) adults of Agriotes ustulatus (Schaller) was established in populations from central Europe (Bohemia, Czech Republic) and the Mediterranean region (Veneto, northern Italy). Both areas, although separated by only 500 km distance, have dramatically different climate. The average proportion of melanic individuals was slightly (by 8%) but significantly greater in populations from Veneto than from Bohemia. The frequency of melanics was identical in both sexes and stable over a 11 year period as well as during the season. The apparent stability of morph frequencies in A. ustulatus contrasts with other insect species where melanic frequencies often vary greatly, both in space and in time.

N2  - Respiratory functions have been monitored by microrespirographic scanning method in immature and adults of Chelifer cancroides (L.) (Pseudoscorpiones) and male adults of wind scorpions Galeodes sp. (Solifugae). Both species exhibited a more or less continuous respiratory pattern with relatively constant, acyclic CO2 output and CO2/O2 ratio of 0.72–0.73 under conditions of high relative humidity, and during feeding or intensive locomotion. Conversely, under dry environmental conditions, during starvation or arrested locomotion while watching for prey, both pseudoscorpions and much larger wind scorpions exhibited a wide range of respiratory cycles with various frequencies and amplitudes. These cycles are characterized by discontinuous emissions of free, gaseous CO2 from haemolymph or tissue buffers. During emissions, CO2 is released at rates surpassing several times the rate of O2 consumption. It is similar to the Prague respiratory cycles found in some insects. In starved adult Chelifer (3 mg body mass, 25°C, dry environment), O2 consumption rate was 5.7 nl per min (136 µl O2.g–1.h–1) with regular Prague respiratory cycles in CO2 release. Duration of each cycle was 4.93 min; the emissions of CO2 lasted 0.9 min, the amount of CO2 released in one emission was 22.8 nl (corrected for simultaneous O2 uptake). Total average rate of CO2 release was 4.16 nl per min (99.8 µl CO2.g–1.h–1): R.Q. 0.729. The emissions of gaseous CO2 were limited only to bursts; the initial rate of CO2 emission exceeded four times the rate of O2 consumption.In starved adult Galeodes sp. (200 mg, 27°C, dry environment, motionless position) the rate of O2 consumption was relatively low (105 µl O2.g–1.h–1); the emissions of 3.9 µl CO2 lasted 4 min with 16 min duration of the whole respiratory cycle. During emissions: gaseous CO2 was produced at 5-times faster rate than that oi O2, consumption.Both the investigated tracheate arachnids can actively regulate breathing by adjusting frequency and amplitude of the respiratory cycles to external or internal physiological conditions. Possible involvement of a special nervous mechanism, similar to the autonomic, parasympathetic-like, nervous system (coelopulse) of insects is indicated.

N2  - The linyphiid spider Drapetisca socialis (Sundevall, 1832) attaches a specialized web vertically to tree trunks: A small sheet is surrounded by signal threads that inform the spider about passing arthropods. Field observations of prey composition revealed the importance of Collembola, especially Sminthuridae, as prey items. As can be seen from video recordings, D. socialis catches prey by a special technique, which is also employed outside the web. The spider moves carefully over its victim, which is grasped from above by means of modified chelicerae and pedipalps. They carry a setal trap, that is unique among linyphiid spiders (in spiders in general?). The tarsi of Drapetisca legs do not have adhesive hairs, thus not being specially adapted to seize prey. The development of triads (the spigots involved in the production of gluey capture threads) was examined in six linyphiid spiders: In three of them, including D. socialis, the triads ale reduced to some extent. which leads to the conclusion that gluey capture threads do not play an important role in the capture of prey in Linyphiidae.

N2  - Morphogenesis and organogenesis were followed in two oxyopid spiders, from egg to spiderling leaving the egg sac. Attention has been paid especially to development of the visual, venom- and silk-gland systems, given that these three systems are functionally implicated in the behaviour of spiders. Chronology of development differs between systems: at the time of emergence, visual and silk-gland systems seem to be functional, while venom glands, together with the digestive tract, are not. This can be correlated with the positive phototaxis and aggregative behaviour of spiderlings.

N2  - There is a limited number of papers which deal with the significance of predation in the decomposer food chain. Microcosm experiments conducted in order to examine the role of predatory microfauna (Protozoa, Nematoda) showed that they increase the rate of decomposition of organic material and enhance the mineralization rate of nitrogen and phosphorus. Experimental results on the importance of larger predators, belonging to the meso- and macrofauna (Acarina, Araneae, Carabidae, Formicidae) were less consistent. In most cases ii was found that they can retard the process of organic matter decomposition and contribute to system stabilization. However, in some experiments their effect on the decomposition rate was negligible.Data concerning food composition of spiders show that these animals can be included both in the grazing and detrital food chains. It is likely that assemblages of spiders can affect decomposition processes.

N2  - The family Agelenidae (sensu Maurer, 1992) is represented in Bulgaria by 35 species, included in 10 genera (Agelena 3, Cicurina 1, Coelotes 8, Cryphoeca 2, Cybaeus 2, Histopona 3, Lycosoides 1, Maimunn 1, Tegenaria 12, Textrix 1, Tuberta 1). This number was established after a taxonomic revision of all available collections containing agelenid spiders in Bulgaria. One new record is also added (Tegenaria zirzulusensis Dresco). Species of the family Agelenidae are distributed in all districts in Bulgaria, occurring in lowland, forest, mountains, caves and buildings or close to them. Regarding their distribution by altitude, there are only 5 species which inhabit the high mountain zone, but only Cryphoeca pirini Drensky is characteristic of the alpine belt. According to their current distribution, the Bulgarian agelenid spiders can be split into 11 zoogeographical categories, grouped into 5 complexes (Cosmopolitan, Palaearctic, European, Southeast European, Mediterranean). The Southeast European complex is the best represented (40%) and shows quire well the local character of this fauna and the main role of the Balkan peninsula in its origin and formation.

The adult diapause of A. fieberi is facultative, induced by short-day photoperiod. Adults reared from eggs under long-day conditions began to lay eggs, whereas those reared under short-day conditions entered diapause. Both nondiapause and diapause adults were sensitive to photoperiod. The adults of the first and the second generation collected from the field were also sensitive to photoperiod. However, after overwintering, adults did not show photoperiodic sensitivity.

N2  - Increased crowding of larvae of the blow fly, Calliphora vicina, within a standard quantity of meat led to reduced larval and puparial weight, shortened development, reduced adult size, and lowered fecundity. Apparent \'\'critical weights\'\' for pupariation in overcrowded cultures were lower than those for larvae manually extracted from under-crowded cultures, suggesting that weight per se is not the decisive factor but - within a rather wide size range - a period of feeding after the moult to the third instar is necessary for onward development to the next instar.

N2  - Severe defoliation of Prunus padus saplings in spring 1987 significantly affected growth and nutrient characteristics for the next five years. Trees that experienced 50% or greater defoliation at age 2 and 3 years were significantly smaller than the controls for up to three years after experimental defoliation had ceased. After five years, trees that had experienced the most severe defoliation were still significantly smaller than those trees that had experienced less severe defoliation regimes. Trees that had experienced high levels of defoliation had significantly higher total leaf nitrogen levels and significantly lower calcium levels two years after defoliation than lightly defoliated trees. Four years after the initial defoliation treatments the situation was reversed, nitrogen levels were higher and calcium levels lower in the controls and lightly defoliated treatments than in the heavily defoliated treatments. The colonisation of the trees by insect herbivores was significantly affected by the initial defoliation treatments. The number of overwintering eggs of the specialist bird cherry feeding aphid Rhopalosiphum padi were significantly greater on the control and lightly defoliated treatments from 1987–1990. Only in 1991 were egg numbers not significantly different between treatments, and in that year populations overall were extremely low. In addition, damage by mid-season generalist herbivores was significantly lower on those trees that had experienced severe initial defoliation. In all other years bar 1989 and 1991, damage levels were significantly higher on those trees. Colonisation by the other bird cherry specialist, the small ermine moth Yponomeuta evonymellus, did not occur until 1991. All trees colonised were from the severe defoliation treatments. These results are discussed in relation to the probable effects on the population dynamics of the two bird cherry specialists.

N2  - A short and intensive pitfall trapping was performed in an apple orchard to estimate the species richness of the ground-dwelling spider assemblage present. Calculation of the total number of species was achieved by an extrapolation performed in two steps: 1. Establishing a series of species Counts corresponding to increasing sampling efforts. Simulation of increasing sampling efforts was achieved by computer sub-sampling.2. An asymptotic function, derived from the theory of island bio-geography, was established to describe the sampling curve. The asymptotic value of this function provided the estimated total species number, corresponding to a sampling effort that would have covered the whole sampled area.The method gave a robust and singular result. This method can be useful in comparative biodiversity studies of animal assemblages.

N2  - Aerial netting at a height of 150 m over West Bengal during November produced evidence for extensive nocturnal migrations of a number of insect taxa, including aphids, leafhoppers, Nilaparvata lugens (the brown planthopper) and Cyrtorhinus lividipennis (a mirid predator of plant- and leafhoppers). Preliminary trajectory analysis was undertaken for aphids (particularly Lipaphis erysimi) overflying the experimental site, and it was estimated from the timing and altitude of flight, and from the winds prevailing at the time, that the long-flying individuals may have originated from sources between 100 and 300 km away to the northeast.

N2  - In patches of five pelted host trees in a large open field, an investigation was conducted of the combined influence of hunger for protein and egg load on responses of marked and released 18-day-old Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) females to proteinaceous food (vials containing bird faeces) and fruit that in terms of the flies\' known ovipositional preferences were high-ranking (hawthorn) or low-ranking (tomato). Consistent with a priori expectation, significantly more females denied access to protein up to testing (protein-deprived females with low egg load) than females given continuous access to protein (protein-fed females with high egg load) were observed on food vials, irrespective of whether tree patches contained hawthorns or tomatoes. As expected, significantly fewer protein-deprived than protein-fed females were observed on hawthorns, where they laid significantly fewer eggs. Contrary to expectation, significantly more protein-deprived than protein-fed females were observed on tomatoes: where numbers of eggs laid were unfortunately too few to permit accurate assessment of trends. Also contrary to expectation, significantly more protein-deprived than protein-fed females were sighted on foliage and in total in tree patches, irrespective of whether the patches contained hawthorns or tomatoes. As expected, response patterns of females that had partial access to protein up to testing (intermediate in hunger for protein and intermediate in egg load) were almost always intermediate between the other two types of females. Intermediate females appeared to allocate approximately equal priority to seeking proteinaceous food to satisfy hunger as to seeking fruit for oviposition. Aided by additional tests conducted in field and laboratory cages, we discuss underlying causes of these observed response patterns.

N2  - Reproductive biology, nesting and ontogenetic development of Onthophagus stylocerus Gräells, 1851 are studied under laboratory conditions. The species is univoltine. Egg-laying begins at the end of May and lasts until July. The development from oviposition to image takes 7–10 weeks. The aestivation of the offspring is combined with hibernation of emergent adults. As with many other Onthophagini, sexual cooperation and food relocation for larval supply plays an important role in the nesting behaviour of O. stylocerus. Nest type may follow any of four patterns, involving: one or more entrance tunnels, branching and brood mass location. Pattern 1: simple, without branching; 1 to 5 brood-masses per nest; moderate depth: 60–160 mm. Pattern 2: simple, with branching but without brood masses in the stretch closest to the surface; 3–9 brood masses;depth: 100–315 mm. Pattern 3: simple, with branching, and brood masses in the stretch of tunnel closest to the surface; 6–7 brood masses; depth 130–220 mm, frequently 200–220 mm. Pattern 4: complex, with one or several entrance tunnels intersecting the main shaft at different levels or converging from the surface to the same brood mass; 10–14 brood masses; depth 280 mm.Early spring emergence of O. stylocerus gives the larvae the time necessary to complete their development before the arrival of the Mediterranean mountain winter, and enables adults to avoid the severe competition which structures coprophagous communities in the late spring.

N2  - n contrast to northern polar areas, the dipteran fauna of Antarctica is depauperate, with only two naturally occurring species of Chironomidae. Surprisingly little is known of the biology of these species. One, Parochlus steinenii, reaches the southern limit of a distribution covering the high Andes, Tierra del Fuego, South Georgia and the South Shetland Islands in the maritime Antarctic. The other, Belgica antarctica, is endemic to the maritime Antarctic. What factors influence the distribution and past colonisation of these two species in the Antarctic? Distributional data and evidence from an accidental introduction of a third chironomid (Eretmoptera murphyi) suggest that difficulty of colonisation is the major factor limiting the number of dipteran species present in the maritime Antarctic. Other sub-Antarctic species are likely to be preadapted to more rigorous conditions, should natural or man-induced colonisation opportunities occur.Evidence from physiological and ecological studies identify adaptations which allow these two species to survive in the harsh terrestrial environment of Antarctica. Life history characteristics of all three species include flexibility in development rates and size achieved, and the ability to continue activity at low positive temperatures. The distribution of the endemic B. antarctica is probably limited by the availability of suitable moist, vegetated, habitats and its brachyptery, rather than biological constraints directly, whereas the southern distribution of P. steinenii may be temperature-limited. Competition does not appear to be an important factor in the biology and ecology of either species, or in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems generally.

N2  - Postembryonic development of the adult color pattern of the shieldbug Graphosoma lineatum (organized as six symmetrical pairs of stripes parallel to body axis, i.e., with necessary dorsoventral positional information involved) was analysed and compared with patterns of some similar pentatomoids. All studied species, despite the probably different ecological role of their coloration (cryptic or aposematic), appear to display the same morphological regularities involved in their dorsal color pattern (three longitudinal pairs of stripes on pronotum and scutellum, more or less fused posteriorly and/or reduced). It is possible that a parallel origin of this color pattern reflects some general morphogenetic regularities whose models are discussed briefly in comparison with the well known situation in Drosophila.

N2  - In outdoor and laboratory pupal populations of Galleria mellonella four types of external gas exchange were found: (i) a cyclic and sudden deep-air suction-intake, followed instantly by a rapid release of CO2, occurring at every 8–14 s at 30°C and identified as UDFµC (Unidirectional Flow Microcycles); (ii) intermittent but slow emission of CO2 without sudden air suction-intake; (iii) chaotic rhythm of gas exchange and (iv) continuous respiration. Wandering larvae at rest and mobile prepupae in cocoons exhibited the same type of gas exchange and some individual breathing patterns which persisted during later pupal development.Regular stereotyped abdominal movements acted as ventilating movements only in individuals which did not exhibit UDFµC in gas exchange. Externally imperceptible abdominal movements due to extracardiacal pulsations of haemolymphal pressure played an inessential role in active tracheal ventilation. The rhythms of abdominal movements persisted in pupae independently of the gaseous exchange type and individual breathing patterns.Among pupae taken from beehives, individuals with UDFµC dominated, while in some laboratory generations only those with chaotic breathing rhythms were found. However, no distinct developmental factors were revealed that could exert influence on the individual formation of the gas exchange pattern.

N2  - The activity and isozyme patterns of esterases and phosphatases which hydrolyse ecdysteroid conjugates were studied in whole body extracts of Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) and in midgut wall extracts of Galleria mellonella (L.). The activity of esterases was almost ten times higher than that of phosphatases (expressed in µM liberated para-nitrophenol/min/mg protein) and seemed to decline with insect age. Cholinesterase sensitive to eserin comprised 14% of total esterase activity in the nymphs of A. pisum, while in other samples it was negligible. Activity of acid phosphatases in the aphid samples was twice as high as that of alkaline phosphatases, while a reverse 3 : 1 ratio was found in the wax moth. The alkaline phosphatases revealed higher sensitivity to fluoride than the acid phosphatases. Esterases were more variable in their isozyme patterns during development than the phosphatases. A possible mechanism of ecdysteroid mobilization from their conjugates and the role of hydrolyzing enzymes in these processes is discussed.

N2  - Lifespan, preoviposition and oviposition periods of Mamestra brassicae were unaffected by larval rearing densities and the group effect. Fecundity of both mated and unmated females was correlated significantly with pupal weight. Weight-related fecundity was not influenced by larval phase variation. Mated females lived, on average, 2 days longer and had 2.2–3.8 times greater potential fecundity than unmated females. Positive fecundity/oviposition period and fecundity/lifespan relationships existed in mated and unmated females, respectively.

N2  - Populations of tree-dwelling aphids are typically characterised by dramatic fluctuations in density within years. Seasonal changes in host plant quality and intraspecific competition are important factors in aphid population dynamics. The seasonal changes in life history traits under field conditions and the effects of high density on body size and reproductive potential of the Turkey-oak aphid, M. boerneri were investigated. Aphid body size is at its maximum in early spring, soon after bud burst, and declines progressively as the Turkey-oak foliage matures. The fat content of individuals, as a proportion of total body weight, remains constant throughout the season. By comparison, a small linear decline in the size of the soma results in an exponential decline in the size of the gonads. At small adult body sizes, embryo size (and implicitly birth weight) is conserved, presumably so that the survival of nymphs born in the summer is maximised.

N2  - Third and fourth instar larvae of Harmonia axyridis were released in spring into rose beds infested by the aphid Macrosiphum rosae. These biological treatments induced stabilization or a decrease of the aphid populations. Their efficiency is comparable with that of chemical treatments performed in neighbouring rose beds and the subsequent development of aphid populations was the same after these two types of treatments. The rearing condition of H. axyridis, particularly its feeding on a substitute prey (lepidopteran eggs), the climate, particularly the rainfall and low temperatures, sometimes near the development threshold of the coccinellid, and possibly the rose bush variety did not seem to affect its potential predatory efficiency. An aphid density of more than thirty aphids per rose bush appears to be necessary for the larvae to remain on the plants, when fifty larvae were released per four bushes.

N2  - This is the first report of the potential of the hyphomycete fungus, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Wize) Brown & Smith, for the microbial control of aphids. The LD50 and LD90 of a strain of P. fumosoroseus isolated from Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) from Multan, Pakistan and bioassayed against third instar Diuraphis noxia (Mordvillco) were 1.78*103 conidia/cm2 and 1.43*104 conidia/cm2, respectively. Strong dosage-mortality and dosage-mycosis responses were evident with larger proportions of individuals dying within the first three days post-treatment at the higher conidial dosages (1.25–3.75*104 conidia/cm2) than was observed for dosages equal to or lower than 3.75*103 conidia/cm2. The LT50s for D. noxia treated with 3.75*104 conidia/cm2 and 3.75*103 conidia/cm2 were 2.06 and 7.50 days, respectively. The entomopathogenic activity of P. fumosoroseus against D. noxia compares favorably with other Hyphomycetes reported in the literature. Based on the results reported here, further investigation of the potential of P. fumosoroseus for the microbial control of D. noxia and other aphids is warranted. In addition to data on the efficacy of P. fumosoroseus as a microbial control agent of D. noxia, a simple, but effective bioassay method for the evaluation of fungi against cereal aphids is described.

N2  - It is argued that the relationship between diapause and cold tolerance has been obscured by the complexity of these strategies. If cold tolerance is broken down into its component mechanisms a relationship between diapause related metabolic suppression and carbohydrate cryoprotectant synthesis is supported by an increasing number of studies. This link seems to have been overlooked because of the view that temperature is the primary cue for cryoprotectant synthesis. However, some major studies cited in support of the latter view have not rigorously tested the role of diapause. An evolutionary analysis of the relationship suggests that diapause-related carbohydrate synthesis could be a primitive feature within the insects that played an important initial role in their colonisation of colder climates.

E. plorans was reared successfully under laboratory conditions and the fecundity was compared with other species of Acrididae. No correlation was found between the volume of CA and the age of adult females, neither with the size of the t-oocytes. The JH-III titre in the haemolymph was very low during pre-vitellogenesis, after which it increased and declined shortly before egg deposition. After the first oviposition, the JH-III titre in the haemolymph did not reach the low values found during pre-vitellogenesis, but did not show high values similar to those recorded before the first egg-laying, as the volume of terminal oocytes increased. Near to the termination of the 2nd gonadotropic cycle the JH-III titre decreased again. No clear cycle of JH-III titre was found in the haemolymph.

N2  - The rate of inbreeding is an important parameter in the population and evolutionary genetics of a species. Accurate measurement of the rate of close inbreeding can be gained through the use of DNA fingerprinting; however, this is both labour intensive and expensive. We here provide a more approximate measure of the rate of close inbreeding in Adalia bipunctata, utilising the unusual phenotypic effect of inbreeding, the production of eggs which develop but fail to hatch, which is seen in this species. Examination of the incidence of grey eggs in known outbred and inbred laboratory crosses and comparison to their incidence in wild-collected clutches produced an upper estimate of 2.7% of wild clutches being the product of close inbreeding. This result is discussed in the light of the ecology and evolutionary biology of Adalia bipunctata.

Foraging was characterized by a high inter-individual variability but patterns did not differ significantly between larvae and adults. All stages spent most of their time searching on needles, on which their prey feeds, and remained mainly in the upper and outer parts of the plant which have a higher needle density in comparison with the interior plant parts. Older stages showed a higher voracity than those younger, but all had a similar predation success when attacking an individual prey. All stages spent a high amount of observation time feeding on honeydew from S. pineti.

N2  - Substrates contaminated with abdominal secretion of first instar larvae of Chrysopa oculata Say or Chrysopa perla (L.) deter females of these species from ovipositing. The intra- and interspecific responses of the females were similar, however, the smaller species, C. oculata, showed a stronger response overall. Although marking with oviposition-deterring pheromone is independent of encounters with conspecific larvae, the contamination of a paper substrate by crowded larvae increases a female response. The increase in response may be due either to the quantity of the pheromone secretion or the amount of marking or both.

N2  - The acts of excreting special fluids containing the secretory products of the Malpighian tubules and smearing them onto the cuticle, referred to as anointing, were observed after moult in 12 species of subfamilies Cicadellinae, Typhlocybinae, Iassinae, Deltocephalinae, Idiocerinae, Macropsinae, Agalliinae, Ulopinae (Cicadellidae) and in Gargara genistae (F.) (Membracidae). Among the species studied anointing was not recorded in Idiocerinae nymphs and in adults of Iassus lanio (L.) only. Usually the first act of anointing was observed 1–3 hours after moulting. Nymphs of Oncopsis, Macropsis, Agallia, Ulopa and Gargara bathe in secretory drops excreted onto the plant surface, in contrast to other nymphs exuding fluids directly onto the body. The fluids excreted by adult leafhoppers of all subfamilies and by nymphs of some Deltocephalinae and Cicadella were found to contain brochosomes, secretory products of the specialized Malpighian tubules. In these cases anointing is associated with repetitive acts of grooming, resulting in formation of a coating of brochosomes on the cuticle. In contrast, the nymphs of the other leafhopper subfamilies, as well as nymphs and adults of G. genistae, secrete brochosome-free fluids, which appear distinct from faeces and contain other secretory products, which, probably, originated from the Malpighian tubules. In addition, nymphs and adults of various leafhopper species occasionally wash their tarsi with a transparent fluid (probably faeces) secreted from the anus. The functions of the brochosome-free anointing and the washing of legs remain obscure. Nevertheless, the characters related to anointing appear to be of value for the classification and assessing relationships between the higher taxa of the Membracoidea.

N2  - Tipula montana, an upland tipulid of northern Britain and generally considered a montane species, was collected from the northern heath habitat of Waskerley Common, County Durham. The growth rate of larvae of Tipula montana was monitored at temperatures ranging from 1°C to 15°C at long photoperiod of 18 h light and 6 h dark. There was no significant growth at 5°C. At 7°C and above, the growth rate increased significantly in larvae initially in instars II and m. However, the growth rate of larvae initially in instar TV was unaffected by temperature, probably due to nearing the onset of pupation. 7°C is the minimum mean monthly temperature found during the main growing season (May–September) at Waskerley Common. Temperature had no significant effect on the weight at which moults to subsequent instars occurred but did accelerate the larval development. At Waskerley Common T. montana follows either a one- or two-year life-cycle. If adequate temperatures (i.e. > 7°C) are not maintained during the growing season, fluctuations could occur in the numbers of individuals following the two life-cycles, resulting in varying numbers of adults produced at each emergence.

Trunk-window traps are suitable for comparison of different substrates within the same forest environment, while comparative studies of different forest environments are more difficult, due to baiting effects. Window trap captures are more suitable for comparing different forest environments, but are related to ecological conditions over wide areas, and are almost unaffected by substrate conditions in the near surroundings of the traps.

N2  - The basic function of the accessory reproductive glands (ARG) of male insects is to provide materials for the production of the spermatophore. The morphology of the ARG of Blattella germanica, including the ejaculatory pouch and duct, the uricose glands, the utricles of the mushroom-shaped body, and the conglobate gland are described. Special attention is given to the fine discrimination of the different tubules associated with the ARG, particularly in the mushroom-shaped body, where up to 12 types of tubule have been recognized. The analysis considered not only morphology and biometry, but also protein pattern. The remarkable diversity found reveals a fascinating complexity, which can be explained if the roles played by the spermatophore they produce are considered.

N2  - Some fossil insects from the Palaeocene of Menat (France), described by Piton as Mantodea, but also Ephemeroptera are revised. The presence of the Neotropical mantid family Chaeteessidae in the Palaeocene of France, inferred by Gratshev & Zherikhin, is confirmed. The presence in Menat of the mantid family Empusidae was an error of interpretation. The order Ephemeroptera is represented only by an undescribed nymph. Biogeographic implications are discussed briefly.

N2  - Crickets are convenient systems for studying life-cycle evolution. They show a considerable diversity in life-cycle types, being homodynamic in some parts of the tropics and heterodynamic with various kinds of diapause and other regulatory responses in the temperate region. Crickets are relatively free from constraints by food supply, because they are omnivorous. Therefore, their geographical variation may clearly reflect climatic selection as exemplified by latitudinal dines in adult size, egg size and ovipositor length. These morphometric dines are closely related to development time, egg diapause and photoperiodic responses, indicating that crickets are highly variable within the framework of their species-specific patterns of life cycle. More fundamental variation is divergence in life-cycle pattern that may be associated with speciation, because closely related species are often different in their life-cycle patterns (e.g., homodynamic versus heterodynamic, or egg overwintering versus larval overwintering). Evolutionary flexibility of life-cycle traits may be assessed by studying cricket populations under special natural or artificial conditions. In Japan, a population of the nemobiine cricket (Dianemobius mikado) introduced from a temperate to a subtropical island has almost lost egg diapause presumably in the last 130 years. At volcanic geothermal spots in the northern island (Hokkaido), presumptive relict populations of the nemobiine species Dianemobius nigrofasciatus occur and sing in mid-winter, but this cricket retains the photoperiodic response of a southern bivoltine type. In the subtropical nemobiine D. fascipes, artificial selection has been effective in changing the incidence and depth of diapause, and strains comparable to the tropical and temperate forms were established. The responsiveness to photoperiod in wing-form determination was also remarkably changed by selection, but this change was not associated with a change in critical photoperiod. Alternated selection in the opposite directions at photoperiods above and below the critical value to be selected was necessary to shift the critical photoperiod.

N2  - Carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were collected from an altitudinal gradient at Chimboraze, Ecuador, in March 1994. Bembidion andinum Bates was the dominant species at 4,800 m, Pelmatellus andium Bates at 4,500 m and Agraphoderus integer Bates at 4,250 m. During daytime, the beetles were sheltering under rocks, but were caught in pitfall traps on open ground during the night. At 0.5 cm depth, soil temperatures from –4 to 41°C were recorded at 4,800 m and from –3 to 52°C at 4,500 m, but fluctuations were greatlybuffered at 2 and 5 cm depths. All three species had mean supercooling points of –5 to –6°C. Rates of water loss at 18°C and 5% RH were 4.4, 1.2 and 1.1% of fresh weight per hour, respectively. Apparently, the carabid beetles are poorly adapted to low temperatures and aridity. To survive the harsh climatic conditions at high altitudes on Chimborazo, they depend on sheltered microhabitats under rocks or below vegetation. Surface activity is restricted to certain periods during the night when conditions are more favorable. In comparison, lower rates of water loss were found in an unidentified species of Dermaptera and a curculionid beetle.

N2  - A projected global temperature rise of 2–3°C can be represented by the change in mean annual temperature experienced over some 10° of latitude or approximately 700 m of altitude in the hills of northern Britain. Using an altitudinal rather than latitudinal transect has the advantage of allowing studies of population dynamics and adaptation of life cycles at the centre and edge of a species\' range within the same locality with similar vegetation and photoperiod. Because of their unusual visibility in spittle masses, spittlebugs offer unusual opportunities to study population change in relation to environmental variables, including climate change.A population of spittlebugs, Neophilaenus lineatus (Auchenorrhyncha: Cercopidae) has been studied for 10 years on a transect from 20 m to 974 m on Ben Lomond, Scotland. The time lag in larval development corresponding with a 2–3°C shift in mean temperature is approximately 3 weeks. Much of this arises from a delay in hatching times. There is a significant relationship between the weather in March to July (which spans hatching and early larval development) and the maximum altitude at which larvae are found in the same year. The study suggests that insects with a similar life cycle to Neophilaenus lineatus will respond to a 2°C rise in mean temperature by extending their range and completing the life cycle two to three weeks earlier.

N2  - Water is an essential part of all living organisms and terrestrial arthropods are no exception. They have to balance water loss and water gain to and from their bodies, often over a wide range of environmental conditions. Water exists in the arthropod body in two main forms: free, bulk or freezable water (usually forming 65–75% of fresh weight), and unfreezable water (often inappropriately termed bound water) associated with membranes and other macromolecular structures. Many factors influence the body water content of arthropods from the physical environment and climatic effects to feeding activity, metabolism and life stage. Some species are adapted to withstand dehydration (loss of 17–89% of their body weight), whilst others enter a state of anhydrobiosis or dormancy induced by partial desiccation. Body water plays an important role in arthropod cold hardiness. Partial dehydration may significantly affect the cold resistance of both freezing tolerant and freezing susceptible forms. An increase in the quantity of unfreezable water in arthropods of both strategies may occur through the production of low molecular weight sugar alcohols (polyols), and desiccation promotes polyol (e.g. glycerol) synthesis in some species.Hibernating insects and other terrestrial arthropods may be threatened by lethal desiccation in their natural habitats, and in cold environments this may be in addition to the possibility of freezing, which could result in death. Whilst a 50% reduction in body water content may double the haemolymph osmolality in an arthropod, the effect of this on its supercooling ability will depend largely on the cryoprotectant concentration and the initial haemolymph osmolality. On the other hand, partial dehydration in winter may increase the supercooling capacity of micro-arthropods by reducing ice nucleator activity.Whilst the biochemical and physiological similarities of the effects of cold and drought may be obvious, it should not be overlooked that desiccation tolerant arthropods may be pre-adapted for freezing tolerance, Thus cold and drought should be viewed as not necessarily competing mortality factors in overwintering arthropods, but as producing complementary adaptations for aiding survival in some species.

N2  - The arctic collembolan Onychiurus arcticus is freezing intolerant and experiences temperatures below –25°C during winter periods of low air temperatures and only light snow cover. Summer-collected individuals have a mean (±SE) supercooling point of –6.1 ± 0.1°C. This study was designed to measure the desiccation resistance and subsequent recovery of O. arcticus from partial dehydration and relate these to its cold-hardiness in terms of changes in the supercooling point (SCP) and solute concentration. Drying curves measured with a recording microbalance showed two distinct phases characteristic of the loss of free and chemically bound (osmotically inactive) water. Rates of water loss at 0°C and low relative humidity (< 5%) were similar to those measured for Antarctic Collembola (5% h–1 of the initial total water content). O. arcticus survived losses of 40% of its total body water content and recovered within 36 h but could not survive losses of 50% of its original water content. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to investigate the nature of the body water, i.e. the proportion of freezable to unfreezable water and the nucleation temperature. The melt onset temperature correlated positively with the body water content. But no clear relationship was seen between the water content and the SCP, either because the springtails had low levels of cryoprotectants or because the ice nucleation activity was unaffected. However, long periods (7 months) at –2.5°C reduced the water content from 74 ± 10.1 to 43 ± 7.2% of fresh weight and lowered the SCP from –6.1 ± 2.1 to –15.5 ± 2.3°C. When given access to water these individuals re-gained their body weight within 24 h. During periods of desiccation water losses were attributed to the loss of freezable water with the unfreezable portion remaining almost constant at 16.5 ± 2.0%. It appears that O. arcticus may experience a reduction of body water during winter periods of sub-zero temperatures, which may lower its SCP and enhance its cold tolerance but that it can rapidly return to summer levels given access to free water during the spring melt.

N2  - A review of the literature regarding anhydrobiosis and cold tolerance in tardigrades is presented. During increasing desiccation, invertebrates like tardigrades, rotifers, nematodes and some collembolans are able to shut down metabolism to undetectable levels. When tardigrades are entering anhydrobiosis, a tun-like structure is formed, facilitated by structural adaptations of the cuticle. Slow dehydration is essential for tun formation, and the accumulation of trehalose during this process may help to stabilize phospholipids and proteins. Wax extrusion on the cuticle surface reduces transpiration. A fraction of 5–15% of the initial body water is retained during anhydrobiosis. Tardigrades are principally aquatic organisms, but anhydrobiosis makes it possible for some species to live in habitats with changing moisture conditions. Tardigrades in anhydrobiosis may tolerate exposure to freezing temperatures of liquid gases, and some species also survive such temperatures in their hydrated state. Few investigations are available on the relation of tardigrades to temperatures more representative to their natural environments. Experimental studies, however, from Greenland and the Antarctic Continent suggest that some species overwinter both in a hydrated frozen state and in anhydrobiosis. During the summer, a number of tardigrade species have been recorded from cryoconite holes, formed on the surface of glaciers. These species are freeze tolerant since their habitats are permanently frozen during the winter.

N2  - Insects living in arid tropical areas may spend long periods without access to free water, and at the end of the dry season they may be severely dehydrated. To survive under such conditions insects have developed a highly restrictive water economy, and tenebrionid beetles from arid tropical areas may lose water at a rate which is a hundred-fold lower than those of insects from humid habitats. In most insects the dominant route of evaporative water loss is across the cuticle. In dry habitat tenebrionid beetles cuticular water permeability has been reduced so much that the water loss accompanying the exchange of respiratory gases across the spiracles has become the major water loss component. A further significant beetles seem to have utilized this opportunity in that they have metabolic rates which are markedly lower than those of most other insects.The low metabolism must imply a corresponding reduction in cellular production of ATP, which is the energy source for cellular ionic pumps. Cellular extrusion of sodium is estimated to consume a substantial fraction of the ATP. Reduced ATP production will therefore also cause a reduced cellular sodium pumping and thus a reduced energy gradient of sodium across cell membranes. This in turn reduces the sodium coupled cellular accumulation of amino acids which requires energy from the sodium gradient. This gives rise to the relatively low extracellular concentrations of sodium and high concentrations of amino acids displayed by these insects. In most animals extracellular amino acid concentrations of this magnitude would have led to a substantial urinary loss of amino acids. However, since desert insects possess an exceptionally efficient rectal system for reabsorption of water and solutes from the urine, a large quantity of amino acids can be returned to the haemolymph from the urine in these animals. Thus, the unique capacity of desert tenebrionids to reabsorb water and solutes from their urine appears to be an important condition also for the low transpiratory water loss of these insects.

N2  - It has often been stated that insects survive at low temperature by one of two main strategies, freeze tolerance and freeze avoidance by supercooling. Apart from the observation that the risk of freezing and its consequences is not the only injurious and possibly lethal effect of low temperature, it is interesting to consider a closely related question. If insects survive at low temperature by tolerating or avoiding freezing, under what circumstances do they die? A survey of the literature suggests there are five reasonably distinct situations representing decreasing levels of cold tolerance where death occurs (1) at some temperature below the freezing temperature or supercooling point (SCP), (2) when the organism freezes, (3) after prolonged chilling at moderate to low sub-zero temperatures, (4) after brief chilling at moderate to high sub-zero temperatures and (5) when temperatures are too low to maintain normal metabolism and the species is unable to enter any form of dormant state. This paper examines how the principles of freeze tolerance and freeze avoidance, derived primarily from studies on species from extreme environments, can be combined with observations on the cold tolerance of insects from less severe climatic zones, to produce a system of classification which allocates species to particular categories, using specific, ecologically-relevant criteria. The proposed new classes of cold hardy insects – freeze tolerant, freeze avoiding, chill tolerant, chill susceptible and opportunistic survival – thus form a continuum of distinct groups, from the most to least cold hardy, in a system of classifying insect cold hardiness that can be applied world-wide.

N2  - Further progress in understanding insect cold-hardiness requires a broader perspective than hitherto. Such a broader approach is feasible, given the range of information now available on cold-hardiness and the variety and quality of equipment to study it. Comprehensive information on individual species is required, using the full range of available techniques, instead of piecemeal investigations. Comparisons of species must likewise be based on how their complete cold-hardiness strategies are structured, rather than on any particular contrasts between individual elements. Most importantly, a well based understanding of cold-hardiness requires wider linkages between cold-hardiness and other salient aspects of the life cycle, such as seasonal timing and control, water balance, and metabolism and energy budgets. Cold-hardiness is only one aspect of the adaptive trade-offs that structure the life cycle of any given species.

N2  - Since most insects are unable to survive internal ice formation a key factor in their overwintering survival is the regulation of the temperature at which they spontaneously freeze, termed the supercooling point or temperature of crystallization. Most insects enhance their supercooling capacity during the winter by eliminating endogenous ice nucleators, accumulating low-molecular-weight polyols and sugars, and synthesizing hemolymph antifreeze proteins. In the absence of heterogeneous ice nucleators, small body size promotes supercooling to temperatures 25°C or more below the freezing point of their body fluids. Although susceptibility to inoculative freezing is clearly detrimental for most species, in some insects it is required for freeze tolerance. Some freeze-tolerant species produce ice-nucleating proteins or lipoproteins that initiate freezing at relatively high subzero temperatures. Insoluble crystalloid deposits, such as calcium phosphate, present in a variety of insects, represent a newly-discovered class of endogenous ice nucleators. During the last few years, a number of research groups have reported ice-nucleating-active bacteria and fungi as normal flora in the gut of overwintering insects. Since these ice-nucleating-active microorganisms markedly reduce the supercooling capacity of insects when ingested or applied topically, they may offer a novel means for the biological control of insect pests during the winter.

N2  - This study summarizes some important new directions in research on antifreeze protein biosynthesis and regulation. It describes the recent development and availability of essential biochemical and cellular tools that make possible more direct cellular investigations, and an assessment of the relationship between thermal hysteresis protein (THP) levels and antifreeze activity (both thermal hysteresis and recrystallization inhibition [RI]). These tools include: 1) the isolation of a specific THP of high activity designated Tm 12.86), and an additional endogenous activating factor of this antifreeze protein; 2) the ability to track the cellular and secretory patterns of Tm 12.86 immunologically; 3) the use of an in vitro fat body cell culture system for direct investigation of cellular events, and, 4) a means of quantifying RI behavior of purified Tm 12.86, and samples of unknown concentrations of THPs, to provide a more sensitive detection method for antifreeze activity at scaled down values associated with the in vitro system. In combination, these studies indicate that the adaptation mechanisms contributing to the overall antifreeze protein response in a cold hardy insect involves a complex interaction between antifreeze proteins and endogenous activators of these proteins. With the availability of these key tools, the details of a precise and seasonal regulation of these antifreeze protein/activator interactions, which ultimately generate an efficient cold hardy response, now have the potential to be worked out.

N2  - CO2 output in Tetrodontophora bielanensis was measured in the temperature range 0 to 20°C using gas chromatography after acclimation to 5, 13 and 19°C in the laboratory. The effect of acclimation temperature on mean CO2 output was not significant. The relationship between respiration and experimental temperature was found to vary depending on the acclimation temperature. It was not possible to obtain a significant mathematical description of the relationship after acclimation to 5°C. The relationship was exponential at acclimation temperature 13°C and linear after acclimation to 19°C. The importance of acclimation to temperature and metabolic cold adaptation in different populations is discussed.

N2  - The tolerance of soil inhabiting Collembola to high carbon dioxide concentrations has been assessed in two collembolan life-forms: the surface-dwelling species Allacma fusca, Orchesella cincta and Tomocerus flavescens as well as Folsomia candida, a species from deeper soil layers. Behavioural changes within the former group could be observed during short-term exposure (one hour) to 5 and 10% CO2, respectively. In contrary, the limit of the tolerable carbon dioxide concentration of the latter species was only reached at 25% CO2. Long-term tolerances expressed as survival times of the half number of specimens in 10% CO2 ranged from a few hours (A. fusca, T. flavescens) to a few days (O. cincia) and > 6 weeks in the case of F. candida. These variations in tolerance may be a consequence of different environmental conditions arising from the risk of the species to experience hypercarbia. Although the ability of adult F. candida to survive hypercarbic periods is remarkable, chronic exposure to enriched CO2 concentrations increased both the duration of egg development and the juvenile mortality rate.

N2  - The effects of interaction between continuous exposure to different low CO2 concentrations (0% and 5%) and temperatures (14 and 25°C) on several life-history traits were studied in the two sibling species D. melanogaster and D. simulans. The various combinations of the two factors were applied during egg-to-adult development and during adult life. Developmental duration was increased by CO2, particularly at low temperature (14°C), and viability reduced. At low temperature, body size was increased, although wing-length variation was reduced by CO2 in this condition. The fecundity of flies reared at low temperature was reduced due to a decrease in the number of ovarioles while carbon dioxide often improved egg production in both species. CO2, unlike temperature, did not appear to be a powerful selective factor, but modified the expression of certain traits, being, in some cases, beneficial to the flies.

N2  - Focussing on one stressor in ecophysiological research, such as low temperature or water shortage, may be practical but is unrealistic, and extrapolation based on these data e.g. to biogeographical distribution patterns, may fail. Ecophysiological research on temperate Collembola during estivation and overwintering serve as an example to show the importance of multiple stressor studies, including the simultaneous effects of food and water shortage and those of food shortage and low temperature. it is advocated to perform multiple stressor studies including toxic substances, such as heavy metals and organic toxicants.

N2  - A workshop is an occasion to raise also \'\'nonproductive\'\' questions as stimuli for discussion between specialists from different fields: (1) What do we know about the processes leading to the end of diapause, and how can we discriminate this diapause end? (2) Is the diapause \'\'normally\'\' completed also when the \'\'natural\'\' diapause development is \'\'substituted\'\' by (re)activation? It seems premature to search for criteria to directly monitor diapause end. We have to rely on the events of post-diapause development which can be recorded only after exposure to permissive environmental conditions. It should be defined clearly, in a study, whether the end of diapause is identified with the resumption of covert developmental potential or with the resumption of overt development. The crucial change to developmental potential should be recognized although it is not directly measurable.The (re)activated adults can differ from adults that completed diapause development by decreased fecundity and/or persistence of photoperiodic response.

N2  - Antarctic terrestrial communities are characterised by their geographical isolation and the survival of extreme environmental stresses. Of particular significance to life history strategies of organisms in continental and maritime. Antarctic zones is the pronounced seasonality, with short (1–4 month) cold summers and long (8–11 month) winters. Activity and growth are largely limited to the summer period, although maintenance costs, undetectable in the short-term, may become significant over winter. Sub-Antarctic invertebrate communities experience a less rigorous regime, as climatic extremes are ameliorated by their oceanic environment, with positive mean temperatures occurring over 6–12 months. Here, year-round activity and growth of invertebrates are common. This paper considers our limited knowledge of the life histories of sub-Antarctic and Antarctic terrestrial invertebrates, to identify features correlated with seasonal and/or climatic cues. There is little evidence for diapause, although seasonal patterns of variation in cold tolerance and cryoprotectant production in direct response to desiccation and decreasing temperatures have been reported. A rapid response to feeding and growth opportunity is shown by maritime. Antarctic species, irrespective of season, although moulting does not occur over winter. Associated reduction of feeding, along with arrested growth and reproductive activity due to the low thermal energy budget over winter are probably sufficient to explain the peaks of moulting and reproduction often observed at the end of winter. Generally there is a high level of flexibility in the observed species life histories, with varying developmental duration and much overlap of generations being the norm, particularly in maritime and continental Antarctica.A formal diapause may be a disadvantage in maritime and continental Antarctic zones, as it would be erroneously triggered by severe conditions during summer. In contrast, the development of specific overwintering strategies including diapause may be unnecessary or even irrelevant in much of the sub-Antarctic, where seasonality is greatly reduced and the risk of severe of stressful environmental conditions during winter is negligible.

N2  - Various types of univoltine life cycle and its regulation were studied in Heteroptera. Very often, univoltinism was ensured by obligatory diapause in the species-specific stage. Obligatory egg diapause has been known in mirids Leptopterna dolobrata and Calocoris roseomaculatus. Obligatory nymphal diapause was investigated in Coptosoma scutellatum and obligatory adult diapause with quantitative photoperiodic regulation of nymphal growth was found in Coreus marginatus and Palomena prasina. Univoltinism occurs also in polyvoltine species. For example, in Arma custos and Pyrrhocoris apterus the univoltine development is regulated by environmental factors. Three peculiarities of the photoperiodic response in A. custos (high thermal optimum and threshold and adult photoperiodic sensitivity only) determine diapause induction in each generation throughout the temperate zone. P. apterus has facultative diapause and both univoltine and bivoltine life cycle in the forest-steppe zone. Usually both pathways may occur in the same vegetative season. In cool years, environmental conditions promote increase in univoltinism, whilst, in those warmer, bivoltinism prevails. The univoltine cycle, including summer and winter diapauses, was found in Picromerus bidens. It is concluded that univoltinism may promote spreading of the species area by the use of natural resources during limited periods of year.

N2  - Photoperiodic response was studied in a pentatomid bug, Graphosoma lineatum (L.). When insects were reared from eggs under constant temperature of 26°C and long-day (18L : 6D) conditions, they developed into reproductive adults and started oviposition about 30 days after ecdysis. Short-day (12L : 12D) conditions and 26°C induced adult diapause. Both diapausing and reproductive adults displayed the photoperiodic response. Reproductive adults stopped oviposition about 10 days after the transfer to short-day conditions, and diapause adults started oviposition about 40 days after the transfer to long-day conditions. Adults from the field were exposed either to short-day or long-day conditions. In late summer, adults that had already entered diapause responded to long-day photoperiod and started oviposition about 65 days after transfer. Thus, diapause induced under natural conditions appeared more intensive than the short-day \'\'laboratory\'\' diapause. Overwintered adults collected in spring started oviposition in both regimens about 7 days after the transfer. The absence of photoperiodic response indicated that diapause was over. However, under short-day photoperiod, females ceased oviposition about 11 days after its onset and re-entered diapause.Czech population of G. lineatum has a facultative adult diapause induced by short-day photoperiod. The adults are sensitive to photoperiod before and in early hibernation and the completion of diapause is accompanied by a reversible loss of photoperiodic response. After a short period of oviposition the photoperiodic response is resumed. Thus, G. lineatum shows the recurrent photoperiodic response.

N2  - A yolk body (yb) trait is the sixth body-colour mutation, discovered in P. apterus, affecting the pteridine biosynthesis. It causes a yolk-like coloration of the mutant body, except the eyes which remain red-pigmented, similarly as in wild-type bugs. While the yb homozygous nymphs and very young imagoes are characterized by yolk-pigmentation of epidermal cells, the body, particularly the forewings of older homozygous mutant adults, turn to yolk-orange colour and then become brick-red. The yb trait exhibits complete penetrance and uniform expression in both sexes. Eight different pteridines have been identified in the yb mutant nymphs and imagoes with use of the paper and thin-layer chromatography. Developmental aspects of the changes in pteridine content found in both studied traits are discussed.

N2  - The effect of extracts from neuroendocrine complexes of brain-suboesophageal ganglion-corpora cardiaca-corpus allatum (NEC) on synthetic activity of corpora allata (CA) in vitro was investigated by a radiochemical assay in Pyrrhocoris apterus. NEC extracts from short-day (diapausing) females and long-day (active) females and males were compared. NEC extracts from both short-day and long-day insects stimulated synthetic activity of the CA from long-day females. The CA from shea-day females were refractory to stimulation. The stimulating activity of the NEC extract was retained after removal of proteins using 10,000-molecular weight limit centrifugal ultrafiltration, but was destroyed by treatment with proteinase K. Therefore, the stimulating factor appears to be a peptide. The culture medium containing a mixture of synthetic products of the CA was extracted by hexane and subjected to TLC analysis. It was revealed that the NEC extract stimulated synthesis of a product from radiolabelled methionine which elutes on TLC in the same position as the major product of the CA of four other heteropteran species.

N2  - The development of a detailed population dynamics model to simulate changes in grain aphid (Sitobion avenae F.) populations on wheat in field conditions requires the identification of every component of the system. The present study proposes a deterministic model for the fecundity function. An optimality theory is applied here to model aphid reproduction in order to obtain a usable mathematical description of larvae laying rate. This rate is assumed to be mainly dependent on temperature since this effect is commonly observed in poikilothermic organisms. It is taken into account by using a thermodependent physiological time scale for measuring adult age. The resulting function is fitted with two data sets. Despite some bias, which is discussed, the model matches relatively well with the observations. The model framework may be easily extended to other species.

N2  - The influence of parasitism by Glyptapanteles liparidis (Bouché) on the development, consumption, growth and food utilization from the third to the fifth instar of its host Lymantria dispar L. was studied on three different host types, each characterized by the stage in which they were parasitized. The first host type was parasitized during premoult into the 2nd instar, the second during premoult into the 3rd instar and the third during the middle of the 3rd instar. Depending on the relationship between the host\'s size and the volume of the parasitoid complex inside the host, different developmental patterns of the various host types were found. From the majority of early-parasitized hosts, the parasitoid larvae emerged during the hosts\' fourth instar (90%), while parasitoids emerged mainly during the fifth instar (77% and 81%) of both later-parasitized host types. Hosts which were heavily parasitized during their premoult stage, avoided obvious nutritional constraints by inserting a supernumerary host instar. Only from one lightly parasitized host type did parasitoid larvae emerge, after developing through only two host instars. Third-midinstar-parasitized hosts had a supernumerary instar only when they contained a relatively low number of parasitoids compared with those from which the parasitoids emerged during the fifth instar. Unparasitized gypsy moth larvae also differed in their developmental pattern, as (78% of males and 72% of females) pupated after the 5th and 6th instars, respectively. Differences in growth and development time permitted the differentiation between sexes, before larvae moulted to the fifth instar.Parasitism most influenced host nutrition in early-parasitized hosts, as they showed increased rates of consumption and growth during the 3rd, penultimate host instar. Higher biomass gains during their final fourth instar of these early-parasitized hosts were due to prolongation of both development and the feeding period, which resulted in a relative consumption and growth rate significantly lower than in unparasitized female larvae and later-parasitized larvae. Growth and consumption rates during the 3rd and 4th instar of later-parasitized host types did not differ from female control larvae. In their final 5th instar these host types did not prolong their development or feeding period, but displayed a reduction in growth rate similar to early-parasitized hosts. The approximate digestibility (AD-value) and conversion efficiency of ingested and digested food (ECI- and ECD-values) was not influenced by parasitism.No correlation was found between the number of parasitoid larvae per host and the duration of the endoparasitic development among most individuals of the three host types. The number of parasitoids per host, however, contributed markedly to the final gross weight, consumption, growth rate and biomass gained during the final host instar.

N2  - Temperature models for predicting the flight activity of the plum fruit moth, Cydia funebrana, were developed using male catches in pheromone traps at four locations in the Czech Republic and one in the Slovak Republic. A method of nonlinear regression by means of Richard\'s formula was used. Total catches of moths from the overwintering and the summer (second) generations were strongly correlated. The regression equation proposed can be used to forecast the expected number of individuals in the summer generation. Whereas the flight curves of the overwintering generation were similar for all populations and years in this study, flight curves of the summer generation differed markedly among populations from different localities. Degree-days from initiation to the peak of flight during the summer were significantly higher at warmer localities, than at the coldest locality. Year to year differences of up to 30 days were found among the flight peaks of the summer generation at the same locality. Regression models proposed for each local population can be used to forecast the phenology of the pest within a year,nd together with other knowledge, they can be used for timing pesticide treatments.

N2  - Dispersal behaviour, colonisation and population structure of damsel-fly species were studied in south-east Germany using mark and recapture techniques. The occurrence of damsel-flies at stream sites was correlated with habitat quality, particularly with the stream flow characteristics, riparian vegetation structure and degree of isolation. The damsel-flies had an area specific average dispersal radius of 0.14 to 0.80 km. The maximum dispersal distance observed was 4 km over a 24 h period. Dispersal movements of more than 1 km ranged from 1 to 5% of the population. Dispersal distances depended on habitat quality factors and population density. Movements were not exclusively directed along streams and their tributaries. There was no significant difference in the dispersal behaviour of male and female damsel-flies, although males were recaptured more frequently. To quantify colonisation ability, the study tries to infer the approximate spatial extent of a damsel-fly metapopulation.

N2  - In the mid fifth-larval-instar tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, the midgut has high ecdysone 20-monooxygenase (E20MO) activity, with a peak at the onset of wandering on day five. Activities of E20MO, present both in mitochondria and in microsomes, were determined around the time of the peak. During the day preceding the peak the microsomal E20MO increased 60-fold (total activity) or 115-fold (specific activity), and it decreased to one half or less of the peak activities within two days after the peak. The mitochondrial E20MO increased only 1.3 to 2.4-fold (total and specific activities, respectively) before the peak, but declined more rapidly than the microsomal E20MO after the peak. It is concluded that mitochondrial and microsomal E20MO activities are controlled independently and that changes in the physiological rate of ecdysone 20-hydroxylation are effected primarily by changes of the microsomal E20MO activities.

N2  - The photoperiodic and neuroendocrine regulations of diapause termination were investigated in two Antheraea species, A. yamamai and A. pernyi which have pupal diapause to aestivate and overwinter, respectively. The types of photoperiodic responses were inverse between the two species, a short-day type in A. yamamai and a long-day type in A. pernyi. When the diapause intensity was compared among A. yamamai and two strains of A. pernyi, the intensity in the univoltine strain of A. pernyi was the strongest, while that in A. yamamai the weakest. Although the timing of ecdysteroid release, a physiological landmark for the termination of diapause, was equivalent in A. yamamai and the bivoltine strain of A. pernyi namely after about ten cycles of exposure to a diapause-averting photoperiod, the basal levels of ecdysteroids in pupae kept in diapause-maintaining conditions were different, higher in A. yamamai than in the bivoltine strain of A. pernyi. Therefore, one correlate was found between diapause tendency and basal ecdysteroid level: the higher was the basal ecdysteroid level, the weaker the diapause tendency. Brain monoamine contents were next investigated in A. yamamai and two strains of A. pernyi, the bivoltine and univoltine strains. Catecholamine levels, especially that of \'\'epinephrine\'\' in diapause pupae were found to correlate with the general strength of diapause, since the univoltine strain of A. pernyi had the highest level, while A. yamamai the lowest and the bivoltine strain of A. pernyi was intermediate. The result infers that high catecholamine contents may be reflected in the refractoriness of PTTH secreting pathway or low sensitivity to PTTH.

N2  - The site of parasitism on a host selected by the ectoparasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis affected the water composition of developing larvae. Second instar wasp larvae developing on anteriorly-parasitized pharate adults of Sarcophaga bullata contained 12% more water by mass than wasps feeding on the posterior end of the fly. Similar differences, although less pronounced, were detected in third instar larvae and are attributed to a greater dry weight (fat). Regardless of the amount of fat present in wasp larvae, rates of water loss and oxygen consumption were the same. This suggests that variation in parasitoid fat content did not contribute to water conservation. Parasitism resulted in an elevation in the hemolymph and fat body lipid content of Salcophaga bullata, but the induced-hyperlipaemia was most pronounced in posteriorly-parasitized flies. Wasp larvae reared on the latter type of host contained the most extractable lipid, implying that variation in parasitoid Eat content simply reflects differences in host composition. Differences in the quantity of host lipids did not alter the duration of parasitoid development.

N2  - Reproduction in Aphelinus albipodus (Hayat & Fatima) from China on Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) hosts was studied in the laboratory. Studies were conducted at three constant temperatures, 10.0, 21.1, and 26.7°C (± 1.0°C), 14L : 10D photoperiod, and 50–70% R.H. The longevity of both males and females was greatest at 10.0°C (26.0 and 41.5 d, respectively); differences in longevity were not significant (p > 0.05) between 21.1 and 26.7°C in both sexes (males 13.1 vs. 10.0 d, females 20.9 vs. 16.4 d, respectively). Fecundity was greater at 26.7 (294.7 ± 27.6 mummies) and 21.1°C (214.8 ± 33.5 mummies) than at 10.0°C (569 ± 11.7 mummies), but was not significantly different (p > 0.05) between the former two temperatures. Aphelinus albipodus did not successfully develop to adulthood at 10°C, thus rm and Ro values were zero, and Tc (generation time) could not be estimated. At 21.1°C, rm = 0.188, Ro = 68.9, and Tc = 23.9 d; those values were 0.288, 67.4, and 15.2 d, respectively, at 26.7°C. The offspring sex ratio (females) was male-biased at all three temperatures: 0.364 ± 0.061 at 10.0°C, 0.437 ± 0.029 at 21.1°C, and 0.341 ± 0.002 at 26.7°C. Moreover, daily offspring sex ratio decreased with the age of the female parent at all three temperatures (p < 0.05). A pre-oviposition period of 1.5 d was observed in A. albipodus at 10° C, and female offspring were not produced during the first 7.5 d of adult life of mated females. The limited number of ovarian eggs, 6.5 ± 2.5, in newly emerged females (< 6 h old) together with their fecundity schedule indicated synovigeny in A. albipodus. Results are discussed in relation to the colonization in North America of A. albipodus for biological control of D. noxia.

N2  - In 1992–1994, the activity of ground surface arthropods was investigated on a fallow field divided into small plots with different regimes of weed management. Daily operated pitfall traps were placed in a transect across the field. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of temperature on the magnitude of total arthropod catches. The pooled catches of all arthropod species were poorly correlated with temperature since its effects were damped by differences in timing of peak abundance of the species. To compensate for the effect of this variation groups of species with similar patterns of annual variation of abundance were selected. The regressions of pooled catch on average daily temperature were then calculated for periods of their peak occurrence when changes of their abundance and/or behaviour were minimum. Seven abundant carabid species were selected and regressions calculated for periods of April 20–May 13 (Bembidion lampros, Harpalus tardus, Poecilus cupreus), June 25–July 25 (H. tardus, P. cupreus), and August 8-September 9 (Amara convexiuscula, H. affinis, H. distinguendus, Pseudoophonus rufipes). By this procedure a significant effect of temperature on carabid activity was shown, similar for different species groups and periods. The catch size increased in the average by 6.3 percentage points per 1°C increase of average temperature. Using this temperature/catch size relationship daily catches of several species were recalculated on a standard temperature of 20°C. This procedure decreased the variation of daily catches by 5–31%. The decrease was proportional to the variation of daily temperatures during the period of sampling.

N2  - Males of the willow-carrot aphid, Cavariella aegopodii (Scopoli) (Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae), that were caged with five or more females had shorter adult lives than those caged with one or no females. Similarly mated females had a shorter adult life than unmated females. The difference in lifespan appears to result from a change in the time of onset of senescence rather than a change in the rate of senescence. Contrary to what is observed in most other animals unmated males of the willow-carrot aphid had much longer lives than unmated females. The asymmetry of the sexes in terms of the factors that affect their fitnesses and the deadline to further egg maturation imposed by leaf fall possibly accounts for why the males of this aphid are potentially the longer lived sex.

In choice experiments, unfed males and females of C. oculata avoid feeding on eggs with stalks, but readily cannibalize those without. The degree of cannibalism is similar in both sexes. Although predation of eggs with and without stalks by hungry adult coccinellids is high, the stalks protect the eggs to some extent.

This is shown for turkesterone/20-hydroxyecdysone and muristerone A using receptor preparations from the epithelial cell line from Chironomus tentans. For all compounds tested, the potency to elicit a hormonal response corresponds with the affinity to the ecdysteroid receptor as determined by induction of acetylcholinesterase, a marker enzyme for cell differentiation.

N2  - A hemagglutinin (HA) was detected during all developmental stages of the corn earworm Helicoverpa zea. The HA titer was relatively low at the onset of each developmental stage; it increased very rapidly during each stage and declined considerably just before the onset of the next. The highest HA titer of 4,096 was attained during days 3–5 of fifth-instar larvae. In contrast, the lowest titer of 8 was obtained in adult insects. Female pupal and adult H. zea had higher HA titers than their male cohorts. The hemagglutinin agglutinated red blood cells (RBCs) from a broad range of animals. Its binding specificity was unusual in that the hemagglutination was inhibited by sucrose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, lactose, galactose, maltose, galactosamine and N-acetyl-galactosamine in that order of decreasing effect. The midgut fluid of H. zea larvae contained agglutinins with a specificity that suggests that they were exogenously derived from dietary ingredients. Unlike H. zea hemagglutinin, which failed to agglutinate flesh mouse erythrocytes, hemagglutinins found in the diet and midgut fluid caused strong agglutination of mouse erythrocytes. HA titer fluctuated between and within the various life stages. Unlike many insect lectins, H. zea hemagglutinin is relatively stable after being subjected to repeated cycles of freezing and thawing. Although it is rapidly inactivated at >= 40°C, this lectin is relatively stable at 20°C. Since it is inhibited by 5 mM EDTA, it is probable that the binding action

N2  - A maternal effect that operates in Sarcophaga bullata normally prevents expression of pupal diapause in progeny of females that are reared under short days. Thus, only the progeny from females reared under long daylength can respond to short daylength by entering pupal diapause. When 20% deuterium oxide (D2O) was added to the larval diet, the diapause fate of the flies was reversed: progeny from long-day females failed to diapause in response to short days, and some progeny from shea-day females entered diapause. The diapause fate of the subsequent generation was also affected. Progeny from females reared on the 20% D2O diet had a high capacity for diapause, thus implying that D2O exerted an effect similar to that of rearing the mothers under long daylength. Several additional effects were noted in flies on the D2O diet: duration of the larval feeding period increased, differentiation of the adult abdomen was sometimes incomplete, and fecundity decreased. While an alteration of the timekeeping mechanism can account for some of these responses, the effects of D2O are pervasive and can influence numerous systems.

N2  - An extensive zoocenotic study of arthropod populations was performed on a Siberian plant Leuzea carthamoides, which was recently introduced to Central Europe as a medicinal crop. Because it contains a very high concentration of insect hormones (ecdysteroids) (300–1,000 ppm of 20-hydroxyecdysone equivalents in the leaves), the plant was thought to be resistant to attack by non-adapted arthropod herbivores (effective concentrations 25–100 ppm in insect diet). Two consecutive seasons of analysis revealed that, in spite of the high ecdysteroid content, the crops of L. carthamoides contained a well-established and consolidated arthropod fauna. 126 species of arthropods were observed on these plants during 1993 and 1994. Of this number, 74 were feeding on the leaves, and 33 of these could complete their adult development on the plants without apparent difficulties. There were also 52 parasitoid and predatory arthropod species of secondary importance. The results revealed the following four observations that are relevant to the possible resistance of L. carthamoides to phytophagous arthropods: (a) the plant is by no means universally resistant to all phytophagous arthropods; (b) the most abundant and, perhaps, most resistant herbivores that can complete their life cycle on the plant are from groups in which ecdysteroid action is little known or unknown, e.g., spider mites, collembolans, thysanopterans, psocopterans or Exopterygota with sucking mouthparts; (c) Endopterygote insect pests, which are the most sensitive to ecdysteroid-containing diet, were represented by only a few species and relatively low abundances; and, (d) all arthropods colonizing this plant belonged to polyphagous or oligophagous species with a relatively wide range of different host plants. Composition of arthropod fauna within plantations of L. carthamoides was similar to that observed in studies of the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), which is also an introduced plant. Physiological conditions associated with possible resistance of insects to dietary ecdysteroids are discussed in terms of the following two points of virtual insensitivity: (a) use of molecules other than the plant-contained ecdysteroid as the endogenous hormone, and (b) elimination of the exogenous dietary ecdysteroid by excretion during feeding period.

N2  - Visual and olfactory responses of onion maggot flies (OMF), Delia antiqua (Meigen), to food and oviposition resources in relation to sex, ovarian development, and time of day, were evaluated in a commercial onion field in Cloverdale, British Columbia, using horizontal coloured sticky traps baited with the oviposition attractant dipropyl-disulphide (DPDS) or feeding attractant, enzymatic yeast hydrolysate (EYH). White and blue were among the most attractive colours to both males and females, but the sex ratio was strongly male-biased (2.7 : 1). Both olfactory baits increased catches of male OMF on all coloured traps to the same extent but neither bait affected the attractiveness ranking of colours. EYH significantly increased female catches on all coloured traps, whereas DPDS only significantly increased response to white traps. The joint action of visual and olfactory stimuli appeared additive in both sexes, not synergistic. DPDS significantly increased catches of mature, gravid females, whereas EYH increased catches of immature females and unbaited traps caught equal proportions of immature and mature flies. The addition of DPDS to white sticky traps could improve monitoring programmes for OMF by attracting more ovipositing females, especially at low populations levels. Census of trap catches every 2 h established a minor flight peak between 10.00 and 12.00 h, primarily in response to food baits, and a major early evening peak (18.00–20.00 h) in response to DPDS. Daily activity patterns of males and females were not significantly different and activity patterns were independent of trap colour. Response to DPDS was low throughout the morning and only started to increase in late afternoon, which is correlated with oviposition patterns observed in laboratory studies. A general crepuscular behaviour and high early evening activity supports the view that where insecticide sprays are still used effectively, these should be applied in early evening.

N2  -  We examined the foraging behaviour of the aphid parasitoid Pauesia pini (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) when foraging for Cinara piceicola (Cholodkovsky) or Cinara pilicornis (Hartig) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) on spruce. The foraging success of P. pini females differed for the two host species but depended also on the hosts\' morph as well as on the presence of honeydew-collecting workers of Formica polyctena (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Females found most hosts and laid most eggs when searching for C. picieicola-VI morphs feeding on the stem. There, they succeeded in laying more eggs into ant-attended hosts than into those unattended. C. piceicola sexuparae feeding on two-year-old shoots were less often discovered, and P. pini females did not oviposit into these small morphs, independent of the presence of ants. C. pilicornis, which is not attended by ants, was least often attacked but P. pini females occasionally parasitized this host species.

N2  - Parasitised aphids often leave the aphid colony before mummification. It has been suggested that this behaviour is an example of host manipulation by the primary aphidiid parasitoid to reduce the risk of hyperparasitism after mummy formation. Mummification site and hyperparasitism risk are surveyed in 16 species of aphid. Mummification away from the colony was not associated with reduced hyperparasitism. In ant-attended species, and in species with well developed parasitoid defence behaviour (such as kicking), mummies formed within the colony tended to suffer less hyperparasitism. In laboratory experiments, two hymenopteran ectohyperparasitoids, Dendrocerus carpenteri (Curtis) (Megaspilidae) and Asaphes vulgaris (Walker) (Pteromalidae), were more successful attacking parasitised aphids [Uroleucon jaceae (L.) (Aphididae)] when the mummies were outside the colony, not surrounded by living aphids.

Thermopreferenda of the different species were invariable over their area of distribution and correlated with their distribution within natural zones and altitudinal bells. Species examined had no seasonal changes of thermopreferenda. Instar specific thermopreferenda were observed.The species examined demonstrated slight seasonal dynamics in supercooling points (SCP). All individual\'s were freeze intolerant. Age variations in SCPs were observed. Larvae demonstrated lower supercooling temperatures than adults, but there were no differences in SCPs between the sexes. The seasonal and age dynamics of the supercooling point temperature were similar for ail species of Pterostichus.

N2  - We evaluated the ability of Philodromidae and Salticidae, the two spider families most commonly found in commercial apple orchards of Massachusetts, to feed on rose leafhoppers, Edwardsiana rosae (L.), important pests of apple foliage. We conducted two different laboratory feeding tests: a leaf test (in which individual spiders were exposed to leafhopper nymphs and adults on single leaves within paper cups for 72 h) and a branch test (similar to the leaf test but foliage on netted branches was used). Controls consisted of cups with leaves or netted branches and leafhoppers but without spiders. In both tests, we found more dead leafhoppers when spiders were present, with most leafhoppers killed during the first 24 h of confinement. In both tests, the two spider families did not differ significantly with respect to the numbers of leafhoppers killed. Smaller spiders consumed more leafhoppers than larger ones in the leaf test, but in the branch test consumption was similar among size groups. Our findings suggest that Salticidae and Philodromidae are capable of preying upon rose leafhoppers and that this capability may vary according to environmental conditions or other factors not tested in this study, such as the physiological state and/or species of spider.

N2  - Based on field data collected during three consecutive years, in experiments with leek and leek intercropped with subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum), the relationship between larval populations of Thrips tabaci on leeks, the level of injury and the market quality of the product were described. This resulted in a way to monitor both thrips populations and market quality during the growing season by the feeding symptoms and in damage thresholds in monocropped and intercropped leeks. It was found that a given number of thrips larvae per plant caused less injury on intercropped leek plants than on monocropped leeks. This proved to have consequences for the damage thresholds in both growing systems. The total effect of intercropping in leeks is based on thrips population suppression and a reduced development of feeding symptoms.

N2  - Sperm of most insects are characterized by the presence of a 9 + 9 + 2 pattern of microtubules. In the present fine structure study, the development of the accessory tubules is described in spermatids of Pyrrhocoris apterus using transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections. The first step in the assembly of the accessory tubules consisted in the formation of hook-shaped protofilament ribbons attached to the B-tubules of the axoneme. Subsequently the protofilament ribbons detached from the B-tubules and formed individual accessory tubules. This mode of formation of accessory tubules has been described previously in Orthoptera, Plecoptera, Diptera, Strepsiptera, Trichoptera and Coleoptera species and, possibly, is common to most insects. The detachment of protofilament sheets from the B-tubulus under natural conditions corroborates experimental evidence that the lateral interaction among protofilaments is very weak. The study revealed also a high incidence of multiflagellate sperm and this phenomenon is documented in the present article.

N2  - Sperm transfer in five Coproica Rondani was studied by separating copulating pairs at varying time intervals from the onset of copulation. In Coproica ferruginata (Stenhammar), C. hirticula (Collin), C. lugubris (Haliday), and C. vagans (Haliday) rapid sperm transfer, which occurs shortly before the termination of copulation, is preceded by a preinsemination phase of species-specific duration. In C. acutangula (Zetterstedt) sperm transfer starts soon after the initiation of copulation and is accomplished slowly. At the beginning of copulation a tight fit of the secondary male gonopore or phallotreme and the openings of the spermathecal ducts, which are located at a vaginal sclerite, is established in all species. However, only in C. acutangula, C. hirticula, and C. lugubris sperm is transferred while those male and female structures are coupled. Males of C. ferruginata and C. vagans unhook their distiphalli before ejaculation and transfer a sperm mass into the female\'s vagina. In both species a mating plug blocks the female\'s secondary gonopore after copulation. The observed traits are discussed with respect to sperm competition and the possibility of sperm manipulation by the females. Three male behaviour patterns observed during copulation are discussed in the context of copulatory courtship: compression of the female abdomen, post-abdominal contractions which cause thrusts of the distiphallus, and drumming of the male leg on the female abdomen. The evolution of sperm transfer in Coproica is examined by mapping the observed sperm transfer traits onto a Coproica cladogram.

N2  - In recent years, several sibling species have been discovered in chrysopid lacewings. In Europe, the common green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) sensu lato seems to correspond to a \'\'complex\'\' of three morphologically and biologically different taxons: Ch. carnea sensu stricto, Ch. kolthoffi (Navás) and Ch. lucasina (Lacroix), the status of which is not yet fully clarified. We examined, by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the esterase and acid phosphatase polymorphism in a natural population of the Chrysoperla complex collected in the centre of France. Five groups of esterases and two groups of phosphatases were investigated, but only two loci, Est-3 and Acp-2, achieved a good resolution allowing a satisfying genetic interpretation. The genetic analysis confirmed the significant divergence between Ch. lucasina, and the two others forms. The genetic similarity between Ch. carnea and Ch. kolthoffi seems to be higher. No alternative allozymes demonstrate that gene flow does not occur in field populations, nor a full reproductive isolation of the different taxons.

To investigate the possible wider importance of coccinellids as vectors of mites, we undertook a survey of the range of mites carried by coccinellids in one location in the United Kingdom. Deutonymphs of six species of mite were found phoretic upon coccinellids, and one species was observed that was parasitic. The importance of these observations awaits further study on the biology and ecology of the mite concerned. It is clear, however, that introduction of coccinellids to an environment will be accompanied by the introduction of mites.

N2  - The insect corpus allatum hormone known as juvenile hormone (JH) was shown by Wigglesworth 60 years ago to play essential roles in repressing metamorphosis and in stimulating aspects of reproduction. Since then, its many actions in reproduction have been increasingly recognized, and it now appears that, in adult insects of most species, JH is a primary coordinator of reproductive processes. All tissues that are directly or indirectly involved in reproduction can be targets for JH action. In evolution, the reproductive role of JH probably preceded its metamorphic role. At the subcellular level, in adult locust fat body, JH induces the synthesis of factor(s) which bind to specific DNA enhancer sequences and stimulate transcription of a target gene. Since JH effects on transcription factors have recently been reported in larval Manduca epidermis, a common basis for the pre-and post-metamorphic actions of JH may be emerging.

N2  - Application of the juvenile hormone analog, 7S-hydroprene, to last instar female larvae of the viviparous cockroach Diploptera punctata on day 1 resulted in vitellogenesis in the basal oocytes of the larval ovary, a peak of juvenile hormone synthesis not seen in controls, as well as maintenance of juvenile characteristics in the instar following the molt. To investigate whether juvenile hormone analog and/or the developing ovary was responsible for such changes in juvenile hormone synthesis, the present study used 7S-hydroprene treatment on intact and ovariectomized last instar females and on last instar males with or without an adult or last instar larval ovary. In last instar males, 400 µg of this JH analog was found to promote vitellogenin synthesis by the male fat body and its uptake by an implanted adult ovary for up to 10 days following treatment. The metamorphic outcome following these treatments shows that hydroprene treatment in the presence of a larval ovary in females and an adult ovary in males resulted in a greater number of supernumerary larval molts than hydroprene treatment alone. This indicates that the ovary did contribute to higher juvenile hormone titers. However, hydroprene treatment did not result in a peak of juvenile hormone synthesis in females or males either with or without ovaries. Hydroprene treatment did result in vitellogenin in hemolymph and uptake in the ovary when a rapidly growing ovary was present.

In bugs reared continuously at 16 h photophase and 25°C (LD regimen), antigens detected with the PL 6.3 and PL 15.2 antibodies accumulate in the accessory glands and vas deferens (in case of PL 6.3 also in the testes) gradually during the last larval instar. The PL 3.4 antibody begins to react three days after adult emergence (1 day before the males become ready to mate), and the reaction is confined to the accessory glands. Insects reared, since the 3rd larval instar, under the diapause-inducing SD conditions(10 h photophase at 25°C and 14 h scotophase at 15°C), do not exhibit any immunoreactivity throughout the last larval instar or during the first week of adult life, and only a weak reaction to PL 15.2 is detected in the older males. Immunoreactivity to PL 6.3 and PL 15.2 can be induced in the last instar SD larvae by brains implants from the LD larvae or two injections of 1 µg makisterone A.

N2  - A first attempt to purify inhibitors of juvenile hormone biosynthesis from extracts of brains of the Indian stick insect, Carausius morosus, is reported here. A heterologous bioassay in the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, was used throughout the study. Separation of a prepurified extract using C-18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) resulted in a broad zone with biological activity. Upon re-chromatography of each of six active regions on a wide-pore C-18 column, the material separated in distinct peaks of biologically active fractions. Introducing a third purification step (C-8 column) resulted in a total of 18 absorbance peaks with allatostatic activity. It remains to be seen whether all these fractions contain authentic allatostatins which are active in stick insects, or whether other functions can be attributed to them.

N2  - A family of neuropeptides (B-allatostatins) from the cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus, which had been purified on the basis of their ability to inhibit juvenile hormone III biosynthesis by cricket corpora allata and which showed high sequence homology with a class of myo-inhibiting peptides from locusts and butterflies, also effectively inhibit ovarian ecdysteroid biosynthesis, thus acting as ecdysiostatins. Within a 3 h in vitro incubation, ecdysteroid production was inhibited between 45 and 50% at 10–7–10–9 M Grb-AST B1 and B2, respectively. Grb-AST B3 and B4 were less effective in inhibiting ecdysteroid biosynthesis (inhibition up to 30%). Additional ecdysiostatic and allatostatic factors occurred in testes from 2–4 day-old adult males. Solid phase fractionation on C18 SEP-PAK cartridges indicated the existence of several polar and non-polar substances with ecdysiostatic activity. Further purification of one of these fractions by means of reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography indicated that some of these factors are probably small peptides, and that at least one of these factors also inhibits juvenile hormone biosynthesis.

N2  - Parturition hormone, present in the uterus of several species of Glossina, causes expulsion of the uterine content in neck-ligated, pregnant females of Glossina morsitans, thus eliciting either parturition or abortion. Uteri of all six tsetse species tested (G. morsitans, G. austeni, G. brevipalpis, G. palpalis, G. fuscipes, G. pallidipes) contain parturition hormone activity, and neck-ligated females of G. morsitans, G. austeni, G. palpalis and G. pallidipes all respond to the hormone by giving birth. Though uterine extracts of both G. brevipalpis and G. fuscipes also contain parturition hormone activity, females of these species fail to respond to a hormone injection in our assay system. This suggests that additional or alternative regulatory mechanisms are involved in regulating parturition in certain species.

N2  - Synthesis of fatty acids by the ovaries of Aedes aegypti was demonstrated by incubating ovaries in tritiated water. Mostly phospholipids were synthesized, however, in mature oocytes the vast majority of lipids are triacylglycerol. 80% of the fatty acids synthesized in vitro were saturated while in the mature oocytes 70% of the fatty acids are unsaturated. These results suggest that lipids synthesized in the oocytes contribute only a minor portion of the lipid complement of the egg and that most of the oocyte lipids are taken up from external sources. The amount of lipid synthesized in vitro by the ovaries was extremely small, less than 1/1000 of the amount of lipid that accumulates in the oocytes. This result, however, may have been influenced by the in vitro conditions. Fat body, under the same conditions, synthesized less than 1/100 of the amount synthesized in vivo. The rate of lipid synthesis in this in vitro system was low, however, the regulation of lipid synthesis appeared to function. Lipid synthesis in ovaries and fat body was strongly inhibited by Tabanus adipokinetic hormone, whereas four other peptides isolated from A. aegypti did not influence lipid synthesis. In the fat body of sugar-fed mosquitoes, lipid synthesis was twice as great as in blood-fed animals.

N2  - A comparison of nuclear structures of the germinal vesicles from an insect with panoistic ovarioles (cricket Acheta domesticus) with that of an insect with meroistic ovarioles (mealworm Tenebrio molitor) was carried out. Immunocytochemistry revealed that spheres from cricket oocyte nuclei contained small nuclear RNP (snRNP) and fibrillarin - protein which may be involved in pre-rRNA processing. Additionally, coilin-related protein was revealed in cricket spheres. In the mealworm germinal vesicles, two types of nuclear bodies containing snRNP were identified. Only one of these types of nuclear bodies contained SC35 splicing factor. In situ, hybridization identified snRNAs U1, U2 and U6 in germinal vesicles of the mealworm and in spheres and karyoplasm of the cricket. After a prolonged incubation of ovaries in medium containing 3H-uridine, the germinal vesicles were labeled; spheres of the cricket and nuclear bodies of the mealworm remained unlabeled. These results indicate that homology exists between spheres and nuclear bodies of insect germinal vesicles and that these are homologous to the coiled bodies of somatic cell nuclei and spheres of amphibian oocyte nuclei. &n

N2  - The development and fecundity of Ceratitis capitata Wiedemann (Diptera: Tephritidae) and the host-parasitoid relationship of C. capitata and its pupal endoparasitoid, Coptera occidentalis (Muesebeck) (Hymenoptera: Proctotrupoidea: Diapriidae) were investigated under conditions in which the host was stressed by heavy metal ingestion. C. capitata larvae (from first instar to pupation) were fed diets that were separately contaminated with three metals; each contaminant was applied at four concentrations that differed by a factor of 2. The lowest concentrations were as follows: copper 100 µg/g, cadmium 25 µg/g and lead 100 µg/g diet dry weight (dw). Larval development, pupation rate and pupal weight of the fruit fly were negatively affected by increasing metal concentrations. Metal concentrations of 400 µg Cu, 50 µg Cd and 400 µg Pb/g diet dw were selected for studying reproductive performance of C. capitata and parasitisation rate, development and reproduction of C. occidentalis. Oviposition, actual fecundity and hatching rates of C. capitata were not significantly influenced by metal contamination. The parasitoid did not discriminate between metal-contaminated and control fruit fly pupae. Parasitisation rates were similar in all treatments (64.6–65%). Heavy metal induced stress of the host altered neither the parasitoid developmental rate nor the proportion of females in parasitoids that emerged from contaminated pupae. Life span and reproductive performance of C. occidentalis females that emerged from metal-stressed hosts were not significantly different from control females. However, a significantly lower percentage of females emerged from copper-and cadmium-contaminated hosts. In groups contaminated by 400 µg Cu, 50 µg Cd and 400 µg Pb/g diet dw, whole body concentrations of the respective metals were determined in pupae and imagines of C. capitata and imagines of C. occidentalis.

If aphidophagous predators can respond to one another\'s deterring allomone then they may avoid competing for prey. The deterrent effect from exposure to C. septempunctata or C. oculata larvae considerably decreased when contaminated sites were kept in open air for 24 h. Females of C. oculata avoided ovipositing at sites exposed to larvae of C. oculata, but the deterrent effect of sites exposed to larvae of C. septempunctata was negligible.

N2  - The effects of combinations of photoperiod and temperature on diapause induction in six species of lacewings (Chrysopidae) from the forest-steppe zone (Russia, 50°N) were examined. Diapause induction in the short day was temperature-independent ill all species, with exception of Chrysopa phyllochroma. In this species the incidence of diapause decreased within the range from 25 to 33°C. The long day prevented diapause only within particular temperature limits, which were species specific. In species with typical long-day photoperiodic response (C. perla, C. septempunctata and Chrysoperla carnea) daily temperature fluctuations were less favourable to diapause induction than constant mean temperature. In C. phyllochroma and C. abbreviata the similar high incidence of diapausing prepupae was induced both by daily natural thermoperiods and constant mean temperature. In experiments carried out under 12-h thermophase: 12-h cryophase conditions it was revealed that photo-thermoperiodic responses of C. phyllochroma were significantly dependent on cryophase temperature, whereas diapause of C. perla was determined mainly by photoperiod. The diversity of seasonal cycles in Chrysopa species and the role of photoperiod and thermoperiod in the development and diapause control in nature are discussed.

N2  - The effect of crowding in nymphal stage on the induction of development of macropterous adults with high flight ability was studied in the laboratory in the water strider Aquarius paludum. High density induced a higher proportion of macropterous morphs than low density. No brachypterous adults developed flight muscles in either experimental density. When kept under high density, about 80% of adults kept indirect flight muscles for 25–30 days after adult emergence, whereas only about 50% or 60% of females and males, respectively, retained theirs when grown under low density. The remaining adults histolysed indirect flight muscles in both groups. Development during the fourth and fifth instars only under high density may induce a higher proportion of macropterous adults than those under low density. &n

N2  - Feeding experiments with female Pisaura mirabilis were carried out in the laboratory. Several species of Diptera, ranging in their size from small fruitflies to large blowflies, were offered. Each spider received a single fly, and then the absolute as well as the relative amount of prey consumption was recorded. Absolute consumption was measured as the amount of a fly consumed by the spiders. Relative consumption, i.e. the utilization rate, was calculated as amount of fly consumed by the spiders divided by the initial mass of the fly. Absolute consumption was positively correlated with the mass of the fly, i.e. the larger the fly the more the spider consumed. No satiation effects were observed. P. mirabilis ingested on average 75% of the prey item, but was able to extract up to 95%. The relative consumption showed no relationship with mass of fly, i.e. the prey size did not influence the utilization rate. Also, neither body size nor age of spiders affected absolute or relative consumption. Furthermore, the fly remnants discarded by the spiders, and uneaten control flies were analysed for their C and N contents. Fly remnants showed a significantly higher C and N content, whereas their C/N ratio was lower. The results show that in the single-prey situation P. mirabilis increases absolute biomass intake with increasing amount of prey available. However, low values and a high variance of the utilization rate indicated that it is not only prey quantity which may be essential for the spiders. We therefore conclude that in future studies the nutritional qualities of prey should be considered more closely.

N2  - In this study the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana caused no humoral immune response in Galleria mellonella when it entered the host through the integument in a natural manner. Initiation of my cosis by injection of living or heat-inactivated blastospores elicited the release of antimicrobial proteins such as lysozyme and cecropins within the hemolymph. Maximum levels were reached 24 h after treatment. Afterwards, these levels declined faster in larvae with established mycosis. Subsequent studies documented the ability of B. bassiana to suppress increases in antibacterial activity within the hemolymph of G. mellonella larvae that were pretreated with injections of microbial provocators. The latter induced non-specific de novo synthesis and subsequent release of several proteins within the hemolymph. The protein synthesis of diseased larvae was not generally affected, even when the larvae were moribund. Among the proteins synthesised during the humoral response, only certain proteins such as lysozyme were suppressed, as detected by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The effects of B. bassiana upon the humoral immune response of G. mellonella are discussed in regards to other parasites such as nematodes or Hymenoptera, which reportedly suppress the synthesis of endogenous host proteins.

N2  - The seasonal activity, age structure and reproduction of the ground beetle Anisodactylus signatus were studied in central and eastern Hungary. A. signatus is a species with summer as well as winter larvae. Beetles showed two seasonal activity peaks: during mid-June, only \'\'old\'\' (overwintered) individuals were caught and this activity coincided with peak egg production; another activity peak occurred in mid-July, when more than 86% of the collected Individuals were \'\'young\'\'. The activity period of old beetles was shorter in the eastern population. Egg numbers in the ovaries were low (2–10 eggs/gravid female). No eggs were found in young adults, which suggests that females do not reproduce during their first adult year; in the subsequent season, they lay an estimated total of 15.6 eggs. Adults can live longer than one year.

N2  - New data concerning geographical distribution of the tortricid moth Epinotia cedricida Diakonoff, a significant insect pest affecting cedars in France, are presented. The species was discovered in Turkey, in two stands of Cedrus libani, where it causes considerable damage. The results of reciprocal crosses between Turkish specimens and specimens native to France and North Africa have confirmed the specific identity of the tortricid. On Cedrus atlantica, E. cedricida is present everywhere in Algeria. In Morocco, it has only been found in three stands of cedar in the Atlas Mountains. With regard to Europe, where the cedar is an introduced species, the tortricid moth has been reported only in France where it has colonized practically all the cedar stands of the Rhône valley, as far as Dijon towards tee north, but is not yet present in those of the Garonne valley or the Poitiers area. Some of these data raise the question of the geographical origin of the strain (either north Africa or Turkey) which was introduced into France accidentally.

N2  - The proboscis of butterflies is formed by the linkage of the galeae on their dorsal and ventral sides, thereby enclosing the central food canal. The two galeae, which develop separately in the pupa, can only interlock by a distinct sequence of movements after eclosion. This interlocking process includes a series of uncoiling and recoiling movements which first align the separate galeae into parallel positions. Discharged fluid temporarily holds them together, so that the galeal linking structures can be engaged by sideward movements and anti-parallel displacements of the galeae. During hardening of the cuticle the firm engagement of the structures is achieved while the proboscis is in recoiled position. In nymphalid butterflies, interlocking of the galeae is an irreversible and indispensable process that can occur only once during a short period following eclosion. &n

N2  - The male scent organs of Hypopteridia reversa (Moore) are described and compared with other androconial organs occurring in the Mythimnini. Abdominal segments A1–A4 possess an organ composed of a pair of little brushes that are linked to the ends of levers which branch off the posterior margin of sternum A2 and a pair of large pleural hair tufts. In the resting position, the tufts are contained in a complex ventral pouch that consists of a base covered by lateral flaps, the latter of which were created by extensive modifications of segments A3–A4. This configuration has no correspondence in other Noctuidae so far examined and is considered autapomorphic to Hypopteridia. Another large posterior abdominal brush is also present on sternum A8. Phylogenetic value of the profound deviations from the groundplan of the abdominal brush organ morphology of trifine Noctuidae is emphasized. &n

N2  - The paper provides information on taxonomy of Anurida species from the northern Palaearctic. 4 new species (A. azurea, A. palustris, A. tatianae, A. sakhensis) are described and several forms are regarded as junior synonyms, viz. A. tundricola Tshelnokov (= A. alpina Agrell), A. balagannakhi Tshelnokov (= A. annatshagi Tshelnokov), A. nerensis Tshelnokov (= A. beringi Fjellberg), A. jakutica Tshelnokov (= A. bondarenkoae Tshelnokov), A. polychnetosa Tshelnokov (= A. hammerae Christiansen), A. mandibulata Tshelnokov (= A. hammerae Christiansen), A. macrochaetosa Tshelnokov (= A. luciae Fjellberg), A. tshuktshorum Tshelnokov (= A. narli Fjellberg), A. arctica Tshelnokov [= A. papillosoides (Hammer)], A. wrangelensis Tshelnokov [= A. polaris (Hammer)], A. tajmyrica Tshelnokov (= A. subarctica Fjellberg). The peculiarities of zonal and geographical distributions of Anurida species in the northern Palaearctic are discussed. A key to the identification of the northern Holarctic species of the genus is given. &n

N2  - In olfactometric experiments a wingless adult of Sitobion avenae was attracted by odours of a wingless adult of Rhopalosiphum padi feeding on a wheat plant. When the stimulus consisted of either a wingless R. padi without plant material or a wheat plant that had previously been infested by a wingless R. padi, the response by S. avenae was not significant, suggesting that recognition is due to volatiles produced by the combination of an aphid and a plant.

N2  - The impact of the microsporidium Vairimorpha ephestiae on the parasitoid Bracon (= Habrobracon) hebetor increased by increasing the concentration of spores to which its host, Heliothis amigera was exposed. Infecting parasitized hosts with the microsporidia did not significantly affect either the egg or larval duration of the parasitoid, while it caused significant prolongation in pupal duration of B. hebetor. However, infected parasitized hosts produced female parasitoids with reduced longevity, oviposition period and fecundity. It was concluded that the detrimental impact on the parasitoid might be related to nutritional deficiency caused by the accumulation of nondigestable spores in the parasitoid\'s gut lumen

N2  - The effects of hypertrehalosaemic octapeptides (peptides from AKH family) on transcription and trehalosegenesis in the fat body of adult females of Tenebrio molitor L. were examined. A synthetic hypertrehalosaemic peptide from CC of Periplaneta americana periplanetin CC-2 (Pea-CAH-II) Glp-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-Trp-amide (1), its new synthetic analogues Glp-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-Phe-amide (2), Glp-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-D-Trp-amide (3), Glp-Leu-Thr-Phe-Thr-Pro-Asn-D-Phe-amide (4), and an octapeptide from T. molitor Glp-Leu-Asn-Phe-Ser-Pro-Asn-Trp-amide (Tem-HrTH) (5) were tested. Peptides 2, 3 and 5 suppress transcription in the fat body tissue measured as incorporation of [3H]-uridine into total RNA. The rate of RNA inhibition in the tissue depends on the peptide concentration. Periplanetin CC-2 (2) was inactive in this test. Endogenic T. molitor octapeptide (5) stimulates trehalose release from the fat body of females, whereas Pea-CAH-II analogues (2–4) do not increase trehalose release from this tissue.

N2  - Screening for puparium formation accelerating activity of neuropeptides and/or analogues belonging to 14 different peptide families revealed the strong activity of members and analogues of the pyrokinin/PBAN (pheromone biosynthesis activating neurohormone) family that all share the common C-terminal sequence, FXPRLamide (X = V, T, S, or G). Both pupariation behaviour and cuticular tanning can be accelerated by a C-terminal pentapeptide fragment composed of only the FTPRLamide sequence. Truncation of the C-terminal sequence to the tetrapeptide TPRLa did not diminish either aspect of the activity. Markedly reduced, but still significant, activity was observed after further truncation to the pyrokinin C-terminal tripeptide. The RLa terminal fragment showed no activity. Thus the C-terminal tripeptide appears to be the active core for pupariation acceleration. The core sequence for a maximum response is the C-terminal tetrapeptide TPRLa. This represents a major difference from the activity profile observed in other pyrokinin assays, in which the C-terminal pentapeptide is required. The C-terminal amide group is also of great importance to pupariation acceleration activity, as LPK acid induces a large drop in threshold activity. Periviscerokinin-2 contains a C-terminal tripeptide sequence (PRVamide) that is quite similar to the pyrokinin C-terminal tripeptide PRLamide and, accordingly, elicits a lower level pupariation acceleration activity. The locust pyrokinin Lom-MT-TV preferentially promotes acceleration of the behavioural over the tanning aspects of pupariation and can therefore, in large measure, provide a means of separating the two aspects. Ligation experiments demonstrated that the effect of the LPK analogues on pupariation behaviour is likely mediated through the CNS, while the action on cuticular tanning is of a peripheral nature.

N2  - Genetic characteristics of the first three mutants found in P. apterus L.; white (w/w) 1965, yellow (y/y) 1966 and melanotic (m/m) 1973 have been described in detail. Exact Mendelian proportions of 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 in all standard test crosses and absence of sexual linkage revealed that each of these mutations was inherited as a single autosomal recessive gene. The dihybrid and trihybrid crosses showed that the w gene is epistatic over y. The absence of linkage shows that each of the described mutant genes is situated on a different chromosome. During 30 years of sustained rearings of P. apterus, the white (w/w) and yellow (y/y) mutants never originated de novo, whereas the melanotic (m/m) mutants originated independently from the macropterous strain three times. Triple recessive (w y m) white melanotic strain has been maintained and used for some genetic investigations for over 20 years. &n

N2  - Taxonomists have described chromatic and morphological variation for a number of European bumble bee species, although molecular studies have so far failed to find significant differentiation. We investigated the genetic variation of Bombus pascuorum from 13 locations by sequencing a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. We find considerably more variation than in published COII sequences for B. terrestris. The DNA sequences from these bees suggest that a difference exists between areas north and south of the Alps, and that the bees within these two areas are very similar over large areas. Therefore, mitochondrial cytochrome b sequences may be able to reveal geographic subdivision in B. pascuorum across the Alps.

N2  - Females of species predatory as adults, Chrysopa commata Kis & Ujhelyi, C. oculata Say and C. perla (L.), and also species not predatory as adults, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens), laid more eggs on clean substrates, than on those exposed previously to conspecific or heterospecific first-instar larvae. Substrates contaminated with oviposition-deterring allomones (ODAs) deterred females of C. oculata most. On the average the deterrent effects of substrates contaminated by larvae of C. oculata or C. perla were greater than those contaminated by C. carnea or C. commata. Results indicate that both intra-and interspecific responses to ODA occur in chrysopids and may enable them to distribute their larvae more uniformly between prey patches. &n

N2  - Pistacia palaestina (Anacardiaceae) is a common tree in the natural forest of Mt. Carmel, Israel, and the primary host of five common species of gall-forming aphids (Sternorrhyncha: Aphidoidea: Pemphigidae: Fordinae). After a forest fire, resprouting P. palaestina trees, which are colonized by migrants from outside the burned area, become \"ecological islands\" for host-specific herbivores.A portion of the Carmel National Park was destroyed by fire in September of 1989. The same winter, thirty-nine resprouting trees that formed green islands in the otherwise barren environment were identified and marked. Tree growth was extraordinarily Vigorous during the first year after the fire, but shoot elongation declined markedly in subsequent years. Recolonization of the 39 \"islands\" by the Fordinae was studied for six consecutive years. Although the life cycle of the aphids and the deciduous phenology of the tree dictate that the \"islands\" must be newly recolonized every year, the results of this study show that trees are persistently occupied once colonized. This is probably due to establishment of aphid colonies on the roots of secondary hosts near each tree following the first successful production of a gall.Differences in colonization success of different species could be related to both the abundance of different aphid species in the unburned forest and the biological characteristics of each aphid species.

Development rates indicated a wide range of host suitability. In the laboratory, larvae of L. botrana had higher survivorship and shorter development time when reared on Vitis vinifera, Prunus persica (nectarina), Taraxacum officinale or Prunus domestica than when reared on Malus pumila, Pyrus amygdaliformis, Prunus armeniaca, Prunus cerasus, Syringa vulgaris or Papaver rhoeas. Similar results were obtained in the field. In no-choice tests in the laboratory, more eggs were laid on fruits than on flowers. Fruits of Prunus domestica, Vitis vinifera and Prunus persica (nectarina) were most preferred as oviposition sites.

N2  - The first detailed description of larvae of Ptecticus Loew is presented for P. brunettii and P. flavifemoratus from West Malaysia. There are pronounced morphological and behavioural differences between the last larval instar, inside whose cast cuticle the pupa remains, and earlier instars. The larval mouthparts are similar to those of other known Stratiomyidae larvae but may display a set of autapomorphic characters. The structure of the mandibular-maxillary complex suggests that larvae of Ptecticus are micropantophagous scavengers that feed chiefly upon microorganisms. The larvae of both species are associated with decaying bamboo shoots; P. brunettii inhabits the space between the culm sheaths and P. flavifemoratus lives in water-filled shoot stumps. This is the first record of aquatic Sarginae larvae and egg plastron in the Stratiomyidae. The life cycle and behaviour of P. brunettii and P. flavifemoratus is described and the resource partitioning of stratiomyids and xylomyids associated with bamboo is discussed.

N2  - Taxonomic limits of the family Anthomyzidae are prescribed. Two fossil genera are affirmed, viz. Protanthomyza Hennig, 1965 (Baltic amber) and Grimalantha gen. n. (type species: G. vulnerata sp. n.) described from Dominican amber. Fourteen extant genera are recognized, including Chamaebosca Speiser, 1903 (= Penquistus Kieffer, 1906 syn. n.) and Apterosepsis Richards, 1962. New diagnoses of the latter two genera and redescriptions of their type species are given and their relationships are discussed. Chamaebosca cursor (Kieffer, 1906) becomes a new combination. The monotypic genus Echidnocephalodes Sabrosky, 1980 is removed from Anthomyzidae, newly diagnosed and its type species E. barbatus (Lamb, 1914) redescribed and a lectotype designated. Echidnocephalodes is considered to be related to Periscelididae and/or Aulacigastridae, particularly to those genera with symmetrical male postabdomen. The inferred phylogeny of the Anthomyzidae, based on cladistic analysis, is presented. The Opomyzidae are confirmed as a sister-group of the Anthomyzidae, while Protanthomyza is found to be the most primi tive anthomyzid genus forming a sister-group to all recent genera plus the fossil Grimalantha gen. n. The monophylies of the latter group of genera, and of the Anthomyzidae as a whole, are demonstrated. The genus Protanthomyza is classified in a new subfamily Protanthomyzinae, and all remaining genera are placed in the subfamily Anthomyzinae Frey, 1921. An annotated world checklist of the family Anthomyzidae is appended.

N2  - Phorids parasitizing Coccinella septempunctata, the seven spot ladybird, attend host prepupae and parasitize them at the point of ecdysis to the pupal stage. In this system, oviposition rates would be maximized through the choice of older pre-pupal hosts in preference to young ones. Field study revealed that old pre-pupal hosts were indeed more likely to be attended by phorids than young pre-pupae. We tested the hypothesis that this was due to a preference by simultaneously offering phorids an old and a young prepupal host in a choice test. The results suggest that phorids do indeed distinguish between host prepupae on the basis of age, choosing the older prepupa.

SP- CCK-8-, PP- and FMRFamide-like immunoreactive cells were distributed unequally in different midgut regions; no cells reacting with antisera against VIP and somatostatin were found. Innervation of the anterior region of midgut, close to the foregut-midgut boundary, included 90-100 FMRFamide-like bipolar neurons that project along the midgut longitudinal muscles. No immunoreactive cell bodies were found in the foregut and hindgut, but nerve fibers with FMRFamide-like material were detected in hindgut muscles and extended over the posterior midgut. No changes in the distribution and intensity of immunostaining of both the endocrine cells and the gut innervation were found in four developmental stages between pre-diapause and hatching. SP-, CCK-8-, PP- and FMRFamide-like immunoreactive cells were also found in the CNS, indicating that the corresponding antigens belong to brain-gut regulatory peptides.

N2  - Five Trichoptera species, representing four different families of three suborders, have been examined for sex chromatin status in relation to their sex chromosome system. These were Hydropsyche sp., Polycentropus flavomaculatus (Pictet), Rhyacophila sp., Anabolia furcata Brauer and Limnephilus decipiens (Kolenatý). None of the species displayed sex-specific heterochromatin in highly polyploid nuclei of the Malpighian tubule cells. Such sex chromatin is a characteristic trait of the heterogametic female sex in the sister order Lepidoptera; it is derived from the heterologous sex chromosome W. Hence, the absence of sex chromatin in somatic nuclei of Trichoptera females indicated the lack of a W chromosome in their karyotype. Correspondingly, diploid chromosome sets of the females consisted of an odd chromosome number, two sets of autosomes and one sex chromosome Z. Thus, the Z/ZZ chromosome mechanism of sex determination has been confirmed. In pachytene and postpachytene oocytes, the Z chromosome having no pairing partner formed a univalent. In Hydropsyche sp., the Z-univalent was distinct as a compact, positively heteropycnotic element. Whereas, in two other caddis-flies, P. flavomaculatus and L. decipiens, it formed a negatively heteropycnotic thread. In postpachytene nuclei of nurse cells of A. furcata, two sister chromatids of the Z chromosome separated as a result of chromosome degeneration and formed a negatively heteropycnotic pseudobivalent. The species-specific differences in pycnosis may reflect a transcriptional activity/inactivity of the Z chromosome during meiotic prophase. The absence of sex chromatin and the sex chromosome system in Trichoptera are characters in common with the \"primitive\" Lepidoptera. This supports a hypothesis that the comm

N2  - Cephalcia masuttii sp. n. is described from the SE Alps of Europe, based on morphological, biological, and genetic studies. The larvae feed gregariously on Picea abies. The species has been recorded also from Central Siberia and NE China, where the larvae feed on Picea obovata and Picea koraiensis, respectively. Indications exist that it may be more widely distributed in Europe and northern Asia. The strict gregariousness of larvae of this species is peculiar among spruce feeders of Cephalcia. Morphologically the adults are most similar to Cephalcia alashanica, with which they are compared. An allozyme analysis showed that the populations from Europe and China are quite similar and clearly different from the other species living on spruce. The karyotype of C. masuttii (n = 25) is also described.

N2  - The Galerucella nymphaeae species complex is a controversial group of leaf-consuming beetles with a Holarctic distribution. It includes several closely allied species or forms living in different habitats and utilizing different food plants. In northern Europe, two species are encountered, G. nymphaeae (L.) living on Nuphar, and G. sagittariae (Gyllenhal) living on semiaquatic or terrestrial plants, while all North American forms have been so far considered conspecific with the European G. nymphaeae. In the present study we have compared chorion polypeptides of the northern European G. nymphaeae and G. sagittariae with North American G. nymphaeae collected from Nuphar. The northern European G. nymphaeae was found to differ from both northern European G. sagittariae and North American G. nymphaeae, which were found to be virtually identical in respect to their chorion polypeptides. The present results, coupled with earlier data concerning e.g. egg morphology, structure of larval cuticle, and comparison of several life history traits, demonstrate that northern European G. nymphaeae and North American G. nymphaeae are not conspecific, and that the North American G. nymphaeae may be more closely allied to the northern European G. sagittariae.

N2  - Flight activity in a pentatomid bug, Graphosoma lineatum, was measured under different photoperiodic conditions. Insects started flying 3 days after adult ecdysis and the percentage of flying adults became highest about 1 week after the ecdysis, regardless of the photoperiod. Under long day (18L : 6D), high flight activity was continued, whereas under short day (12L : 12D), most adults stopped flying when diapause was induced. In both photoperiods, a small number of adults showed flight of a long duration, longer than 30 minutes. Thus, no evidence was found relating the long flight to diapause. It is suggested that diapause adults of G. lineatum do not overwinter far from their breeding sites and thus there is no migration to hibernation sites. Also, the long flight is probably only a foraging flight, enabling the bugs to find their dispersed host plants.

N2  - The development of the Western Flower Thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis Pergande; Thysanoptera: Thripidae) was studied at six temperatures between 10 and 35°C. Developmental rate increased linearly as rearing temperature increased. It was estimated that 268 degree-days, above a threshold temperature of 7.9°C, were required to complete development from egg to adult. These data were related to records of field temperatures in the West Midlands region of the UK, to estimate the potential number of generations per year that could complete development in outdoor conditions. Using this data, a maximum of between three and five generations could have developed annually between 1986 and 1995, (in the absence of factors impairing continuous development). The application and relevance of this data as an indicator of the potential range of F. occidentalis is discussed.

N2  - Frenae are forewing-holding ridges situated in the Heteroptera parallel to the lateral sides of mesoscutellum, and covered by a squamiform, overlapping, glabrous microsculpture. The situation found in Rectilamina sp.

N2  - Adult collembolans we:re fed with two different food types. Leaves of Taraxacum officinale and Dactylis glomerata were given as food sources in two physical forms: either as intact leaves or as powder. Foods were labelled with 15N. The 15N uptake curves were measured. Turnover rates and turnover times were calculated. Results show that Taraxacum leaves are preferred to Dactylis leaves. The physical condition of the leaves influenced the nitrogen turnover of the animals to a large extent. Fragmentation of Dactylis leaves enhanced nitrogen utilization by roughly two-fold and decreased turnover time by nearly half. Consumption of Taraxacum leaves has synergic effect on the nitrogen utilization of Dactylis leaves. Simultaneous consumption of Taraxacum and Dactylis enhanced the nitrogen uptake rate from Dactylis leaves compared to the treatment where Dactylis was the only food source.

N2  - 24-hour experiments on dark-adapted compound eyes of the green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea (Stephens) show significant daily changes in absolute sensitivity to stimuli of different colors, but no daily changes in the spectral sensitivity. The absolute sensitivity is highest for all wavelengths at mid night, and lowest at noon. The daily shift of sensitivity is, however, most pronounced in the working range of the eye in the bluegreen-green region of the spectrum. The electrophysiologically measured sensitivity of the compound eye to monochromatic stimuli correlates with the size change of its superposition aperture after illumination with white light. The daily sensitivity pattern is in good agreement with the daily flight activity pattern (see Duelli, 1986).

N2  - Rhagoletis pomonella (Diptera: Tephritidae) flies were exposed for 3 days in laboratory cages to yellowish, green or white surrogate leaves with or without food (sucrose) on the leaf surface. When tested in an arena minutes after fly removal from an exposure cage, yellowish surrogate leaves were more attractive to tested flies than green surrogate leaves irrespective of the nature of surrogate leaves to which flies had been exposed. However, flies exposed to green surrogate leaves having food exhibited greater propensity to alight on green surrogate leaves than flies exposed to yellowish or white surrogate leaves having food. This propensity disappeared when flies were tested 24 h after termination of exposure to green surrogate leaves having food. There was no evidence of enhanced propensity of flies exposed to yellowish surrogate leaves having food to alight on yellowish surrogate leaves when tested minutes after removal from an exposure cage. We discuss the potential ecological significance of the evidence presented here that R. pomonella flies are capable of learning to associate the presence of food with green color of leaf surface on which food could be found.

N2  - Ten aphid species wcre used as prey for Adalia bipunctata and six of them (Euceraphis betulae, Cavariella konoi, Liosomaphis berberidis, Acyrthosiphon ignotum, Aphis farinosa and Macrosiphoniella artemisiae) are new essential preys for this coccinellid. Eucallipterus tiliae and E. betulae were the most suitable prey according to the rate of larval development, larval mortality, adult fresh weight and coccinellid abundance in the field. They are followed by L. berberidis, C. konoi and Tuberculatus annulatus. M. artemisiae and A. ignotum are also very profitable food in the laboratory, but they do not occur in the field together with A. bipunctata. A. farinosa from Salix caprea and Aphis fabae from Philadelphus coronarius were not very suitable as food due to the larval mortality (27% and 23%, respectively). A. fabae from Atriplex sagittata was an unsuitable prey: larval mortality was 67% and the adults that emerged as the survivors had the lowest weight recorded in this series of experiments. Aphis spiraephaga was also unsuitable prey: all 1st instar larvae of A. bipunctata died, even though slowly.

N2  - Many aspects in the life-history of aphids are critically dependent on the quality of their host plants and prevailing temperature. Therefore, the fitness of an aphid clone will depend on these parameters and will determine its ecological and ultimately its evolutionary success. Measuring and calculating the fitness of an organism in a natural environment is an important but also a difficult task, as many parameters that code for fitness need special assumptions, e.g. a uniform environment or stable age distribution. In this study, three aspects of environmental variability were considered: (a) the nutritional supply of the host plants (high- and low-quality plants), (b) the changes in host plant quality due to the endogenic life cycle of the host and (c) constant and variable temperature regimes. For each of three successive generations of Cinara pruinosa (Hartig) feeding on Picea abies (L.) Karsten, the change in fitness was determined by calculating the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and expected total reproductive success (ETRS) when the aphids were reared under greenhouse (constant temperature) or field (variable temperature) conditions. Nutritional supply, plant life cycle and temperature affected the fitness of aphids, with fluctuating temperatures obscuring the effects. As a consequence, differences in fitness values among treatments were most pronounced under the constant temperature regime of a greenhouse and less marked in the field. If plant quality varies but not temperature, the contribution to clonal fitness of early generations is overestimated in comparison to later generations. The limitations and consequences for the interpretation of fit ness values of aphids are discussed.

N2  - This report summarizes a study designed to uncover any tendency towards hyperparasitic behavior in Brachymeria pomonae (Cameron), a parasitoid of pink bollworm (PBW) (Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders) imported from Australia to California for biological control of the latter pest species. Brachymeria pomonae hyperparasitized both Apanteles oenone Nixon (ca. 10% of pupae exposed) and Cardiochiles nigriceps Viereck (ca. 23% of pupae exposed), and all hyperparasitic offspring of B. pomonae were males. However, B. pomonae\'s aggressive primary parasitism of several lepidopterous hosts, together with the low hyperparasitism rates and the failure to produce hyperparasitic female offspring suggested that hyperparasitism is a facultative behavior in this parasitoid. Brachymeria pomonae caused substantial mortality in A. oenone and C. nigriceps as a result of ovipositional probing. Finally, it did not attack PBW nor A. oenone pupae if they were not enclosed in a PBW cocoon, but aggressively attacked the pupae of both when enclosed in PBW cocoons. The results are of significance because B. pomonae was a candidate for release against PBW in California. Because of its facultative hyperparasitic habit, no effort was made to release it from quarantine. The basis for this decision, including the uncertain impact that hyperparasitoids may have on biological control programs, is discussed.

N2  - The relationship between web design and prey capture in orb-web spiders was examined by correlating the mean mesh height with the mean prey length per species taken from existing literature (15 species) and new data (Larinioides sclopetarius and Argiope keyserlingi). Pooling the data from all species, the results revealed no significant relationship. Analysing the data from L. sclopetarius and A. keyserlingi separately, no overall significant relationship was found. However, the analyses of the separate observation days showed that mesh height correlated significantly with prey length on one of the five observation days for A. keyserlingi, but not for L. sclopetarius. Consequently, the spacing of the sticky spiral in the orb-web can have a significant effect on the length of the captured prey under certain circumstances, which are discussed in the present paper.

N2  - The weevil species Listroderes abditus Enderlein belongs in the subtribe Listroderina. This species had been previously transferred to Antarctobius, based on characters from the adult morphology. However, larval characters suggest that it was placed correctly in Listroderes. A cladistic analysis of this species and nine other rhytirrhinines for which larvae are known was performed, based on 56 morphological characters (32 from larvae and 24 from adults). According to the single cladogram obtained (78 steps, CI = 0.65, and RI = 0.72), L. abditus should be included in Listroderes rather than in Antarctobius. Larval and adult characters were also analysed separately, leading to poorer resolution in comparison with the simultaneous analysis, and suggesting that a stable classification requires the analysis of data from both life stages.

N2  - A comparative study of mitotic activities and haemolymph ecdysteroid levels was performed in the phasmid Clitumnus extradentatus. Temporal correlation was found between increases in mitotic frequency in mandibular and general epidermis, and variations of ecdysteroid levels in the haemolymph of the insects. Whereas, mitotic waves occurring in the fat body cells or in the basal cells of the midgut did not appear to be strictly correlated with these hormonal variations. During the fourth larval instar of this phasma; an accurate study of mitotic figures, monitored from histological sections, indicated a time-lag in their stimulation according to the studied area, with a peak on day 2 in the mandible tips, on day 5 in the mandible bases and on day 7 in the head capsule, thorax and abdomen epidermis: namely a five-day delay with respect to the 12 days of the fourth instar. Simultaneously, the evolution of ecdysteroid levels in the haemolymph showed three increases of different importance. Each hormonal increase occurred 24 h before the triggering of each increase in the mitotic activity, whereas a fourth and very high peak, occurring on day 8, corresponded to the sudden fall in the number of epidermal mitoses.

N2  - The behavioural response of an aphid-tending ant, the Argentine ant Linepithema humile, to semiochemicals related with spacing behaviour in the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) was evaluated. The compounds involved were 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (MHO), 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol (MHOH), and 2-tridecanone (2-T). Hexane solutions of these semiochemicals either singly or mixed, and extracts obtained by trapping volatile compounds from wheat seedlings either alone or infested with two different densities of aphids were used as stimuli in olfactometric bioassays. Ants showed attraction to volatile extracts from plants infested at both densities, and slightly preferred volatile compounds from lightly over heavily infested plants in a choice test. On the other hand, while a dose-dependent repellence response was elicited by the naturally-occurring mixture of MHO, MHOH and 2-T, single compounds did not elicit significant responses in olfactometric bioassays. The function of these semiochemicals as indicators of quality of the aphid colonies as trophic resource to ants is discussed.

N2  - Geoica wertheimae induces spherical galls on its primary host, Pistacia palaestina (Anacardiaceae). We studied the temporal changes in gall size and aphid clone size, as well as gall distribution and abundance on marked trees during two consecutive years. The density of galls (per shoot and per leaf) was low during the study period, and gall distribution was clumped. Gall abundance varied greatly among trees, but gall abundance and tree budburst phenology were uncorrelated. Galls increased eight-fold in volume during the season, in parallel with the increase in aphid clone size, from one individual to several hundred aphids per gall. The trigger for the induction of the alate morph in the galls in late summer seems to be an abrupt change in aphid density within the galls, which occurs when aphid reproductive rate exceeds the rate of change in gall internal surface area. Two species of Lepidopterous larvae were present in about one-third of the galls. They occasionally destroyed the aphid clone, but many aphids often remained alive. However, the volume of parasitized galls was significantly smaller than that of unparasitized galls, illustrating the dependence of gall size on aphid clone size.

N2  - The development of a B-biotype Bemisia tabaci Italian colony was studied on bean at 9 constant temperatures (15, 16, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29, 32, 35°C). The developmental time from egg-to-adult varied from 70 days at 16°C to 22 at 26°C and higher temperatures. A thermal requirement for egg-to-adult development of 307 day-degrees was calculated, based on a lower developmental threshold of 11.53°C. The survival of egg, nymph and adult whiteflies was investigated at 0, 2, 4, and 6°C on broad bean for periods of 1–8 days. The adult was the most cold-sensitive stage, while the egg and nymph showed a similar level of cold resistance. The effect of sub-lethal cold stress of 4–8 days at 4°C on eggs and nymphs was studied. After exposure to low temperatures, whiteflies needed longer developmental times, from 5 to 8 days more. The presence of B. tabaci under outdoor conditions in Italy was investigated with field surveys and correlated with climatic data; the whitefly species was found in open field conditions only south of the 41° parallel, in areas characterised by less than 5 frost days per winter and by annual mean temperatures >16°C.

N2  - The univoltine leaf miner Chromatomyia fuscula (Zetterstedt) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is a regular cereal pest in Scandinavia. The fly and its most important parasitoids were studied in a 15.5 ha organically-grown field in southern Norway. Each year (1992–1997), one Malaise trap was placed in the spring barley part (2.5 ha) of the field, and (except for 1994) another along the nearest wooded boundary for the whole season. Because of crop rotation, the traps changed position every year. C. fuscula and 15 parasitoid species previously reared from C. fuscula were sorted from the catches. Few C. fuscula were trapped in the boundary, suggesting that at least the lower vegetation strata were unimportant for the overwintering fly (C. fuscula overwinters as an adult). The parasitoid complex was remarkably stable over years, and 13–15 of the species were: found each year (habitats combined); 0–6 of the species were not found in both habitats each year. Only 4 species attained fractions higher than 10% of the total annual catches in both habitats during the 6 years: the larval parasitoids Diglyphus begini (Ashmead) and Hemiptarsenus unguicellus (Zetterstedt), and the pupal parasitoids Cyrtogaster vulgaris Walker and Chrysocharis pubicornis (Zetterstedt). In the boundary, C. vulgaris dominated every year (43–83%). In the crop, this species alternated with D. begini (1992, 1994) or H. unguicellus (1997) as the dominant species.In most years, the catches of both the leaf miner and its parasitoids were larger in the crop than in the boundary, but the species number and composition were fairly similar in the two habitats. The parasitoid diversity (Shannon-Wiener H\') tended to be higher in the crop (0.8–2.0) than in the boundary (0.8–1.8). Correspondingly, the evenness (both Shannon-Wiener J\' and species rank on In abundance) was higher, and the dominance (Berger-Parker) lower, in the crop than in the boundary. Every year, overwintered C. fuscula invaded the crop, but only in 1993 and 1997 did the trapping reveal a distinct next generation, suggesting a very high pre-adult mortality the other years. In 1993 and 1997, C. vulgaris and D. begini had rather similar abundances in the crop, and the lowest combined fractions (less than 60%) of the years, leading to the highest diversity and the lowest dominance through the 6 years (in both habitats).Our results indicate that the boundary was part of the parasitoids\' foraging/overwintering area, and that the boundary was more important to the parasitoids than to their leaf miner host. Boundaries therefore seem to be important for the control of C. fuscula.

N2  - A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the indirect effects of soil salinity on a caterpillar that induces gall formation on a non-halophilic plant. Larvae of Epiblema scudderiana (Clemens) were allowed to feed on potted goldenrods (Solidago altissima L.) treated with 3 concentrations of NaCl (0, 8,000, 16,000 PPM). Experiments were also carried out with the larvae of two species of leaf beetles, Trirhabda borealis Blake, a leaf-chewer, and Microrhopala vittata F., a leaf-miner, to determine the influence of feeding guild. Adding salt to the soil affected both the plant and insect herbivores. The biomass of roots and shoots as well as root/shoot ratios of salt-stressed plants were lower, relative to controls. The biomass of the fully grown larvae and galls were decreased for the plants treated with the highest salt concentration. The percentage of biomass allocated to the gall was increased by soil salinity. All gall-inducing larvae completed their development (from second to final instar) even though their biomass was significantly reduced in the 16,000 PPM treatment. Soil salinity increased nitrogen concentrations in both gall and stem (normal) tissues but the levels were always higher in the gall. The salt treatments also increased sodium and potassium concentrations in galls and stems. Interestingly, sodium concentrations as well as the ratio of sodium ions to potassium ions increased more rapidly in the stem compared with the gall. Responses of folivorous insects to salt-stressed plants varied. Leaf-chewing larvae ate smaller amounts of plant tissue with high salt content compared with control, which also resulted in shorter feeding periods. The performance of the leaf-mining insect was not affected. However, it was able to complete its larval development within a smaller portion of the leaves. This study showed that soil salinity has a strong negative effect on S. altissima, especially on root development. Conversely, salt stress effects seemed to be progressively decreasing from the stem to the gall to the gall-inducer, which suggests that the gall tissue might act as a buffer against drastic changes in the mineral balance of the host plant. Nevertheless, it seems that unless the host plant dies, larvae of E. scudderiana can always produce a gall in which they can complete their development. On the other hand, leaf-chewing insects appeared to be sensitive to salt-rich tissues since they were deterred by them. Leaf-miners could complete their development with fewer food without any effect on their growth, suggesting that the peculiar tissues on which they feed within leaves became more abundant or nutritious in salt-treated plants.

N2  - Habitat use of Bolitophagus reticulatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), living in the basidiocarps of Fomes fomentarius (L.) Kickx, was investigated in three forest areas in south-eastern Norway: (1) a continuous, coniferous forest, (2) an agricultural area with mostly deciduous forest islands in a matrix of cultivated land and (3) a homogeneous, old deciduous forest stand. B. reticulatus was almost exclusively found inside dead basidiocarps. The size of the basidiocarp was the most important variable for predicting the probability of B. reticulatus presence in the basidiocarps from all three study areas. Drier basidiocarps had a higher probability of beetle presence than the wetter ones. Basidiocarps situated above the ground level had a higher probability of beetle presence than those close to or on the ground level. In the first study area, the presence of Cisidae was found to reduce the probability of B. reticulatus presence perhaps as a result of competition. The disappearance of beetles from previously inhabited basidiocarps seemed to be due to depletion of resources.

N2  - The parasitoid wasp Dinocampus coccinellae has been reported to parasitise adult, pupal and larval coccinellids. Field samples of larvae and pupae of Coccinella septempunctata, collected over 13 years in Britain, have failed to reveal any infected pre-imaginal individuals. The parasitisation rates of D. coccinellae into pre-imaginal and adult C. septempunctata were assessed in both choice and no-choice tests. Observations and test results revealed that British D. coccinellae have a strong preference to oviposit in adult coccinellids rather than larvae or pupae. This preference decreases as wasps age if denied oviposition opportunities.

Ladybirds taken from aggregations (and hence those that had stopped foraging naturally) suffered just 9% mortality overwinter, compared with 72% mortality in a sample of active ladybirds that were prevented from continued foraging. Even after accounting for their lower relative weight, these active ladybirds suffered disproportionately higher mortality.

N2  - Sandfly females, while feeding on the host, excrete urine to concentrate proteins of the bloodmeal and restore weight and water balance. This process, analogous to prediuresis in mosquitoes, was observed in 100% of Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) and 85% of P. duboscqi Neveu-Lemaire females studied. Individual females, however, differed in duration of prediuresis and in the number of ejected urine droplets. In both species the prediuresis generally started 1–2 min after the commencement of feeding and the variation in urine production was positively correlated with the length of feeding. The first one or two droplets were opaque whitish while the remaining ones were clear. Erythrocytes were found sporadically in first droplets of some females. Representative prediuresis in P. duboscqi included 27 droplets, i.e., about 325 nl urine in total, ejected during 8 min of feeding. The study revealed prediuresis in P. papatasi and P. duboscqi as a regular physiological process which may have consequences in transmission of infective diseases.

N2  - Insects and other terrestrial arthropods are widely distributed in temperate and polar regions and overwinter in a variety of habitats. Some species are exposed to very low ambient temperatures, while others are protected by plant litter and snow. As may be expected from the enormous diversity of terrestrial arthropods, many different overwintering strategies have evolved. Time is an important factor. Temperate and polar species are able to survive extended periods at freezing temperatures, while summer adapted species and tropical species may be killed by short periods even above the freezing point. Some insects survive extracellular ice formation, while most species, as well as all spiders, mites and springtails are freeze intolerant and depend on supercooling to survive. Both the degree of freeze tolerance and supercooling increase by the accumulation of low molecular weight cryoprotectant substances, e.g. glycerol. Thermal hysteresis proteins (antifreeze proteins) stabilise the supercooled state of insects and may prevent the inoculation of ice from outside through the cuticle. Recently, the amino acid sequences of these proteins have been revealed.Due to potent ice nucleating agents in the haemolymph most Freeze tolerant insects freeze at relatively high temperatures, thus preventing harmful effects of intracellular freezing. Doe to the low water vapour pressure in frozen environments, supercooled terrestrial arthropods are at a risk of desiccation. Glycerol and other low molecular weight substances may protect against dehydration as well as against cold. In the arctic springtail Onychiurus arcticus, freezing is avoided due to dehydration in equilibrium with the ambient freezing temperature. Tn some frozen habitats terrestrial arthropods are enclosed by ice and survive an oxygen deficiency by anaerobic metabolism.Suggestions for further research include investigating the nature of freeze tolerance, the physiology of prolonged exposures to cold, and the relation between desiccation, anaerobiosis and cold hardiness.

N2  - In diapause-destined larval cultures of the blow fly, Cailiphora vicina, competition through severe overcrowding forces down body size and causes the smaller individuals to escape from the diapause \"programme\" to form miniature puparia. Among the diapausing cohort, smaller larvae contain a similar proportion of fat to larger larvae, and a similar rate of fat metabolism over the first 7 weeks in diapause. However, these smaller diapausing larvae are much less cold tolerant than larger individuals. Of the miniature larvae that side-step the diapause programme to form puparia, even the smallest of them are capable of development to the adult, and these small-sized adults are capable of depositing \"full-sized\" eggs (although fewer of them) which hatch to produce \"full-sized\" and viable larvae. These data suggest that the smallest individuals, by avoiding the diapause programme, may gain a selective advantage by completing another autumnal generation instead of entering diapause and failing to survive because of a reduced cold tolerance.

N2  - The abundance and distribution of coccinellids in non-crop habitats was studied using removal sampling and visual observation. Coccinellids were most frequently found on grassland habitats. Coccinellid abundance appeared to be most strongly correlated with the percentage ground cover of thistle, grasses and nettles. The most commonly collected coccinellids were Coccinella septempunctata and Adalia bipunctata comprising 60% and 35% of the catches respectively. Most coccinellids were found on Rubus spp. with nettles (Urtica dioica) and grasses being the next most favoured plant species. Adalia bipunctata was the most commonly found coccinellid species on nettles and birch (Betula spp.) whereas C. septempunctata was the most commonly found species on grasses, Rubus spp. and oak (Quercus spp.). These results are discussed in light of current thinking on the importance of \"island\" habitats as pali of an integrated pest management programme.

N2  - The gypsy moth oophagous predator guild in the Mamora forest is an assemblage of many species whose succession in egg masses enhances the exploitation of this food source. Life history, biological Features and trophic capacities of predator species are described from field observations and laboratory rearing. Extreme diversity of diets, capacity to resist prolonged fasting and extended larval development with extra-instars enable them to survive on the cork oak when gypsy moth egg masses are absent. The 1986–1990 gypsy moth outbreak occurred in a forest part where unhealthy cork oaks are common. by providing abundant shelter for numerous arthropods these trees are beneficial to the oophagous predators which find there various and abundant food sources. This probably explains why egg predator activity in the infested area rapidly increased so that the pest outbreak collapsed.

The aim of the research was to determine which factors were best related to species composition. This knowledge is the first step towards the definition of indicator species or assemblages. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that altitudinal gradient was the factor most correlated with beetle distribution. However, some other variables, such as water mineralization and eutrophication, were also important.Using TWINSPAN program, groups of sites were defined and, afterwards, represented on the CCA diagram. Several species assemblages were defined on the basis of their frequencies of occurrence in these site groups. The environmental features of site groups and beetle assemblages were assessed with the aid of CCA. In this way, assemblages typical of high reaches could be separated from those of low stretches of the rivers. Similarly, communities from non-polluted waters could also be defined. Although several species are present in polluted sites, no assemblage exclusive to these sites has been found.

N2  - Bisexual gonads in the stoneflies Perla burimeisteriana, P. pallida and Dinocras cephalotes are reported for the first time. Gross morphology and ultrastructure of the accessory ovaries of mature larvae and adult males of Perla marginata are described in detail. There are 36–58 male ovarioles situated distal to the paired testes and opening into fused termini of the lateral ducts in abdominal segments II and III. These correspond in structure to the ovarioles of adult females but are significantly smaller (maximum size of proximal oocyte 9.0 × 45 µm) and each usually contains 10–14 linearly arranged previtellogenic oocytes. Oogenesis ceases at the end of previtellogenesis or at the onset of vitellogenesis. The ooplasm contains either regularly dispersed or irregularly accumulated particles in different regions of the cell with accumulations occurring near mitochondria and Golgi complexes. Based on results of metachromatic staining, these are thought to represent either lipid droplets (most) or yolk globules. The oolemma rarely develops short microvili and few pycnotic vesicles. Development of the follicular epithelium (influencing vitellogenesis and secretory activity during choriogenesis) is abnormal. Follicular cell growth is not synchronized with that of the oocytes, and the follicular cells of the terminal (distal) oocytes show neither patency nor secretory activity. The mechanism controlling degeneration of male ovarioles and the evolutionary significance of hermaphroditic gonads in the Plecoptera are discussed.

N2  - The relationship between body size and reproduction was investigated for two laboratory strains of Podisus nigrispinus (Dallas). A strain originating from Surinam and maintained for about 15 years under laboratory conditions, did not demonstrate any significant relationship between body length and fecundity. A second strain originated from Brazil where it had been reared in the laboratory for several generations but under different conditions of climate, food and housing. In the first generation of the Brazilian strain, a significant positive relationship was found between body length and total number of eggs. Results suggest that colonization might act initially in favour of a positive body size/fecundity relationship. In contrast, females of the fifth and tenth generations, like those of the Surinamese strain, showed no significant relationship between body length and reproduction. Fecundity of the tenth generation of the Brazilian strain, with an average of 317 eggs per female, was significantly greater than that or the first and fifth generation, with 220 and 243 eggs per female, respectively. The strain from Surinam, with 545 eggs per female, had a markedly higher reproductive capacity than any generation of the Brazilian strain. Adult body weights of different generations of the Brazilian strain increased consistently from the first to the tenth generation, indicating an adaptation to the new environment. Females and males of the Surinamese strain lived longer than those of the Brazilian one. Besides differences related to the geographical origin of the strains, greater fecundity and longevity in long-term laboratory strains of P. nigrispinus may reflect selective adaptation to food and climatic conditions in the laboratory environment.

In addition, the spatial arrangement of cells in the leaf of the host plant was histologically observed and the number of cells between the epidermis and phloem counted. The results suggest a feeding deterrent effect of hydroxamic acids and a constant styler puncturing activity into plant cells.

N2  - Climate features that influence life cycles, notably severity, seasonality, unpredictability and variability, are summarized for different polar zones. The zones differ widely in these factors and how they are combined. For example, seasonality is markedly reduced by oceanic influences in the Subantarctic. Information about the life cycles of Arctic and Antarctic arthropods is reviewed to assess the relative contributions of flexibility and programming to life cycles in polar regions. A wide range of life cycles occurs in polar arthropods and, when whole life cycles are considered, fixed or programmed elements are well represented, in contrast to some recent opinions that emphasize the prevalence of flexible or opportunistic responses. Programmed responses ale especially common for controlling the appearance of stages that are sensitive to adverse conditions, such as the reproductive adult. The relative contribution of flexibility and programming to different life cycles is correlated with taxonomic affinity (which establishes the general lifecycle framework for a species), and with climatic zone, the habitats of immature and adult stages, and food.

N2  - There is much current discussion about the factors that control the distribution and abundance of animal species, particularly at the edges of their range. The significance of temperature for survival and development is compared in two closely related psyllid species (Craspedolepta nebulosa and C. subpunctata) living on the same host plant (Chamerion angustifolium) (Onagraceae) but displaying different distributions along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients. The following measurements were made at critical periods during the life cycle (a) winter supercooling points (SCPs), (b) tolerance of short (1 min) and long term (1–25) days exposure to sub-zero temperatures above the SCP, (c) tolerance of short term exposure to high spring/summer temperatures and (d) comparative field development rates among species and sites during the early critical part of the growing season. Successful completion of the life cycle is related to heat availability during the growing season. This appears to limit the distribution of the Craspedolepta species, rather than their survival response to thermal extremes. No significant differences were found between the two species in the supercooling point or in their long and short term survival responses at low or high temperatures.

N2  - First stadium juveniles of P. angustus were reared under controlled seasonal conditions to maturity, reproduction and death. Individuals born in any one breeding season either had a 1-year or a 2-year life cycle (cohort-splitting). The life cycle was annual for individuals born in the first part of the breeding season (May–August), but became biennial for those born later (August-October). Two phenomena were involved: (1) Only individuals reaching the penultimate stadium (stadium VII) before a critical period at the end of spring could become adult in the breeding season following that of their birth. After this time, stadium VII individuals entered into aestivation and only became adult in the second autumn after their birth. (2) Females becoming adult in autumn entered reproductive dormancy and only laid eggs in the following spring. Overall, individuals born at the start of the breeding season easily reached stadium VII before the critical period and were able to breed at I year, whereas individuals born at the end of the breeding season reached stadium VII after the critical period, then had two consecutive periods of dormancy and only bred at 2 years age. Individuals from the same nest born in the middle of the breeding season (August) could have either annual or biennial life cycles, depending on whether they reached stadium VII before or during aestivation. The environmental factors capable of triggering aestivation in subadults and reproductive dormancy in autumn-maturing females are discussed.

N2  - Myrmica rubra is a northern, temperate Palaearctic ant species with a geographical range that extends from the Atlantic coast of Europe to central Asia. In Europe, its range covers > 25° of latitude where it lives under a variety of climates that vary from extreme oceanic in the west, to continental in the east. Colonies nest in the soil and their life cycles are known to be highly dependent on ambient temperature and soil moisture. We hypothesised that the brood-rearing behaviour of populations might be focally adapted to climate and that we might detect differences when the ants were reared under \"common-garden\" conditions. Brood-rearing behaviour was compared for 38 colonies of M. rubra drawn from 13 populations representing a range of 6 latitudes: all 6 were represented in eastern Europe and 2 in western Europe. A sample of ants from each colony was used to estimate respiration rate, body mass and fat content at the start of the experiment in spring (immediately post hibernation) and at the end of the experiment (mid summer). Respiration had a linear relationship with latitude, with northern populations having greater respiration rate in spring compared to southern populations. It is suggested that this is an adaptation to different seasonality over the species\' range that results in the \"more active\" northern workers rearing fewer brood to maturity more quickly than southern workers. Fat content, a measure of worker \"quality\", had a parabolic relationship with latitude with mid latitude colonies having the fattest workers. Fatter workers appeared to rear heavier brood. This probably represented a functional response to environment with populations living at \"edge of range\" sites being physiologically more stressed and performing brood-rearing tasks less well than centre of range populations. We believe that this is the first demonstration of a consistent, intra-specific trend for Variation in the social physiology of an ant species over its geographic range.

N2  - Winter climate determines the success of the two main reproductive strategies employed by aphids. Permanent parthenogens survive as parthenogenetic females in mild winters, but are regularly eliminated by low temperatures; while cyclical parthenogens, which switch to sexual reproduction by the end of summer, produce every year fertilised diapausing eggs resistant to frost. We have studied the variation in sexual morph production of several clones of the cereal aphid Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) showing both strategies. Twenty clones of this species differing by their geographic origin and their mode of reproduction were placed in two laboratory environments mimicking the changes of photoperiod and thermoperiod occurring naturally from the end of summer and during the autumn in oceanic and continental conditions. The analysis of clonal responses in both climatic conditions showed (i) a wide variation in investment of clones in sexual reproduction with, in particular, evidence for a mixed strategy employed by clones producing both sexuals without ceasing parthenogenetic reproduction, (ii) no geographic adaptation among clones belonging to cyclical parthenogenetic populations, (iii) an earlier production of sexuals in continental conditions and a higher production of males in oceanic conditions.Furthermore, we have compared the dates of first appearance of sexuals in our experiments with those occurring in the field based on a suction trap database and found that sexuals were caught in nature at least four weeks earlier than in the lab. These results underline the need for a better understanding of the influence of the whole array of environmental factors inducing the transition from parthenogenetic to sexual reproduction in aphids.

N2  - We investigated the effects of genetic differences and host plant density on population development of the rose-grain aphid Sitobion avenae (F.) (Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae) in winter wheat stands. Aphid numbers on ears were recorded on 11 cultivars (6 years) and on plots where crop density was varied by thinning (12 years). Crop density significantly affected whole plant, tiller and ear mass, number of tillers, and leaf area and chlorophyll content. The duration and rate of aphid population growth, and the maximum numbers of aphids were ascertained by weekly counts. Maximum abundances increased with the length of time available for the growth of aphid populations while the rate of population growth was less important. Variation of maximum numbers of S. avenae on different cultivars was not significant, probably due to the small variation in the period available for the development of aphid populations. By contrast, there was a significant Variation of aphid performance associated with host plant density. Aphid populations on solitary plants persisted longer and became more abundant than in dense stands. The prolonged survival of aphid populations was probably caused by an extended period of tillering and lower average age of tillers of solitary plants. There was large annual variation in aphid abundance. It is likely that modifications of host plant development caused by differences in winter weather may contribute to this variation.

N2  - Mean development rates under cycling temperature regimes (both alternating and sinusoidal regimes) have been found to be either accelerated, decelerated or unaffected when compared to development at constant temperature regimes with equivalent means. It is generally accepted that this phenomenon is a consequence of the non-linearity inherent in the temperature-rate relationship of insect development and is known as the rate summation, or Kaufmann, effect. Some researchers invoke an additional physiological mechanism or specific adaptation to cycling temperatures resulting in a genuine alteration of development rate. Differences in development rates at constant and cycling temperatures may have important implications for degree-day (linear) population models, which are used in bath pest management and ecological studies. Larvae of Aglais urticae L. (small tortoiseshell), Inachis io L. (peacock), Polygonia c-album L. (comma) and Vanessa atalanta L. (red admiral) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) were reared at constant (10, 15, 20, 25, 30°C) and alternating (20/10, 25/15, 30/10, 30/20°C) regimes. Development rates under the alternating regimes used were found to differ from those under equivalent constant temperatures in a pattern suggestive of the Kaufmann effect: in all species development at 20/10°C was faster than at 15°C, and for three species development at 30/20°C was slower than at 25°C. The exception was A. urticae. A similar pattern was found for growth rate and pupal weight. The results are discussed with respect to cycling temperature theory and degree-day modelling.

N2  - Most studies of responses of insects to elevated carbon dioxide have been made using short-term exposures to treated food plants and have involved measurements of responses in growth, reproduction, food consumption and efficiencies of conversion at specific stages in the life cycle. These will be reviewed in the light of longer-term studies recently published where whole generations have been reared in chambers with simultaneous treatment of plants and where insects have been free to select their food and microenvironment. Factors such as seasonal change in plants, choice of food plant, mode of feeding, timing of exposure, temperature, the role of natural enemies are considered and the whole placed in the context of other aspects of climate change. It is concluded that in studies to date, the only feeding guild in which some species have shown increases in population density in elevated carbon dioxide are the phloem feeders. Chewing insects (both free-living,and mining) generally have shown no change or reduction in abundance, though relative abundance may be greatly affected. Compensatory feeding is common in these groups.

N2  - Insect cold tolerance mechanisms are often divided into freezing tolerance and freeze intolerance. This division has been criticised in recent years; Bale (1996) established five categories of cold tolerance. In Bale\'s view, freezing tolerance is at the extreme end of the spectrum of cold tolerance, and represents insects which are most able to survive low temperatures. Data in the literature from 53 species of freezing tolerant insects suggest that the freezing tolerance strategies of these species are divisible into four groups according to supercooling point (SCP) and lower lethal temperature (LLT): (1) Partially Freezing Tolerant-species that survive a small proportion of their body water converted into ice, (2) Moderately Freezing Tolerant-species die less than ten degrees below their SCP, (3) Strongly Freezing Tolerant-insects with LLTs 20 degrees or more below their SCP, and (4) Freezing Tolerant Species with Low Supercooling Points which freeze at very low temperatures, and can survive a few degrees below their SCP. The last 3 groups can survive the conversion of body water into ice to an equilibrium at sub-lethal environmental temperatures. Statistical analyses of these groups are presented in this paper. However, the data set is small and biased, and there are many other aspects of freezing tolerance, for example proportion of body water frozen, and site of ice nucleation, so these categories may have to be revised in the future. It is concluded that freezing tolerance is not part of Bale\'s (1996) continuum, but rather a parallel, alternative strategy of cold tolerance.

N2  - Survival and Lt50 after exposures at constant low temperature were compared to the values obtained at alternating temperatures in two active (summer acclimated) temperate terrestrial arthropods. The experimental regimes used interruptions - daily transfers from the lower temperature to various higher temperatures for two hours or to one high temperature for Various durations. In both species the alternating conditions improved survival, implying reparation of the chill injury. In the collembolan Orchesella cincta, there was a maximum Lt50 when the higher exposure temperature was equal to the temperature of rearing (19°C). In the bug Pyrrhocoris apterus, Lt50 increased strongly with increasing higher temperature from 0 to 15°C, and was subsequently constant over the entire physiological range suitable for development (to 35°C). Exposure at 0°C was harmful if continuously applied, but survival increased, relative to a constant exposure at –5°C, if the temperature alternated between –5 and 0°C.

N2  - In order to manage the risks posed to domestic crop production by quarantine pests such as Thrips palmi, their potential to establish in a new environment must be assessed. The thermal requirements for development of T. palmi were determined and compared with UK temperatures, to estimate its potential for development under UK conditions. Temperature and rate of development of T. palmi from egg to adult were linearly related between 15 and 30°C, allowing calculation of an overall threshold of 10.1°C, and a sum of effective temperatures of 194 degree-days. In the UK, development of T. palmi would be possible outdoors during the summer when a maximum of up to four or five generations could occur. Comparison of these data with those of the recently established and biologically similar pest, Frankliniella occidentalis, shows that establishment of T. palmi in the UK is unlikely to be limited by an inability to complete the life cycle during the favourable season.

N2  - Cold hardiness of larvae of the summer fruit tortrix moth, Adoxophyes orana (Fischer von Rosslerstamm) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) was examined in the laboratory. Supercooling point of field collected larvae increased significantly from a mean value of –23.9°C in February 1998 to –16.9°C in June 1998. Mean supercooling points for laboratory diapause and non-diapause larvae were –20.7°C and –17.2°C respectively. Short period of acclimation (10 days at 0°C) significantly decreased supercooling point to –24.7°C for laboratory diapause larvae. Acclimation for 12 days at 5°C decreased supercooling point to –19.4°C for non-diapause larvae. Pre-freeze mortality for diapause and non-diapause larvae was also studied. Constant exposure of diapause larvae at –5°C resulted in high mortality (63.1%) after a period of 30 days. in contrast, only 6 days at –5°C were sufficient to cause 100% mortality of non-diapause larvae. Mortality of non-diapause larvae reached 100% after 12 and 18 days at 0 and 5°C respectively. The importance of these findings for the overwintering strategy of A. orana is discussed.

N2  - The oribatid mite Galumna elimata was reared under laboratory conditions on algae (Protacoccus spp.) at different temperatures (5, 15 and 20°C). Higher weight-specific amylolytic activity was found in the whole body homogenates of mites exposed to cold acclimation (5°C, 21 days) in comparison with individuals acclimated to 15 and 20°C. Accompanying parameters (live body weight, content of total soluble proteins in the body, protein-specific amylolytic activity, presence and composition of food boluses, activity of mesenteric and caecal wall cells, gregarinid parasitisation, number of glycogen granulae and guanine deposits in mesenchymal tissue, presence of proventricular glands) were investigated at all three acclimation temperatures to explain mechanisms of this change. The acclimation response of weight-specific amylolytic activity was accompanied by elevation of protein-specific amy lolytic activity. Microanatomical features did not confirm any increased secretion activity of mesenteric and caecal cells in cold acclimated animals. Granulation and apocrine secretion of these cells increased with increasing temperature as with food ingestion. The food boluses contained algae or algae mixed with unknown fungal hyphae in individuals acclimated to 15 and 20°C. The concentrated mucoid substances prevailed in animals exposed to cold, indicating lower feeding activity at 5°C. Based on these findigs, Lye hypothesised that specific amylolytic activity reflected passively the different changes in protein composition of the body at different temperatures and its elevation is without direct adaptive importance.

N2  - The plant-parasitic nematode Ditylenchus dipsaci shows a delay in recovery following a period of desiccation and reimmersion in water. This delay, called the \"lag phase\", has been shown to be related to the severity of desiccation. It is the severity of the desiccation stress during dehydration, rather than the final relative humidity to which the animal is exposed which determines the length of the lag phase. A lag phase appears even after a brief exposure to desiccation. These results indicate that a period of repair, or the restoration of a normal physiological state, must be undertaken before activity can resume.

N2  - The intertidal collembolan Anurida maritima can endure periods of twice-daily submergence by seawater. The air-breathing terrestrial apterygote insect has developed specific adaptations to prevent respiratory failure during hypoxic stress. When submerged, the animal is initially enclosed by an air-bubble. This bubble lasts three times longer than the small amount of stored oxygen would allow. The air bubble acts not only as an oxygen store but also as a compressible gas gill. This was demonstrated by an O2-needle electrode technique which allowed recordings of pO2 changes in the watery medium close to the animal. Oxygen uptake in A. maritima follows an aerial mode of respiration during the first three hours of submergence. Oxygen consumption rate at decreasing ambient O2 partial pressures showed oxyregulating behaviour during severe hypoxia.

N2  - Hexamerins are hemocyanin-related haemolymph proteins that are widespread in insects and may accumulate to extraordinarily high concentrations in larval stages. Hexamerins were originally described as storage proteins that provide amino acids and energy for non-feeding periods. However, in recent years other specific functions like cuticle formation, transport of hormones and other organic compounds, or humoral immune defense have been proposed. During evolution, hexamerins diversified according to the divergence of the insect orders. Within the orders, there is a notable structural diversification of these proteins, which probably reflects specific functions. In this paper, the different possible roles of the hexamerins are reviewed and discussed in the context of hexamerin phylogeny.

N2  - Although a monophyletic group, male (XX/XY) and female heterogametic (WZ/ZZ) sex chromosome systems with a couple of variants like XX/X, Z/ZZ and multiple sex chromosome systems occur in insects. Molecular and morphological differences between X and Y or W and Z range from imperceptible to conspicuous. This article illustrates sex chromosome differentiation mainly in two fly species, Drosophila melanogaster and Megaselia scalaris, and in Lepidoptera. The earliest phases of XY evolution are present in the fly M. scalaris. Occasionally in this species, the male determining gene jumps to another chromosome, transforming the new host chromosome to a functional Y chromosome. Thus, in M. scalaris there are strains with virtually no XY differentiation (except for the sex determining function) and others with a moderate degree of differentiation. Base substitutions and alterations like sequence deletions, duplications, and insertions of mobile sequences mark the onset of molecular differentiation. Accumulation of molecular changes and coarser alterations are thought to lead to the morphological differences seen in WZ chromosome pairs of Lepidoptera. The W chromosome probably evolved in the most numerous clade of Lepidoptera, the Ditrysia, after it diverged from the common lepidopteran stem. Extant species display various degrees of molecular and morphological differentiation of the W chromosome, translocation or fusion with autosomes, and loss of the W.

N2  - The monophyly of the Endopterygota is supported primarily by the specialized larva without external wing buds and with degradable eyes, as well as by the quiescence of the last immature (pupal) stage; a specialized morphology of the latter is not an endopterygote groundplan trait. There is weak support for the basal endopterygote splitting event being between a Neuropterida + Coleoptera clade and a Mecopterida + Hymenoptera clade; a fully sclerotized sitophore plate in the adult is a newly recognized possible groundplan autapomorphy of the latter. The molecular evidence for a Strepsiptera + Diptera clade is differently interpreted by advocates of parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses of sequence data, and the morphological evidence for the monophyly of this clade is ambiguous. The basal diversification patterns within the principal endopterygote clades (\"orders\") are succinctly reviewed. The truly species-rich clades are almost consistently quite subordinate. The identification of \"key innovations\" promoting evolutionary success (in terms of large species numbers) is fraught with difficulties.

N2  - More than 60 neuropeptides that inhibit juvenile hormone synthesis by the corpora allata have been isolated from the brains of various insect species. Most of them are characterized by a common C-terminal pentapeptide sequence Y/FXFGL/I/V (allatostatin A family, allatostatin superfamily). Besides the allatostatin A family, allatostatic neuropeptides belonging to other two peptide families (W2W9)-allatostatins or allatostatin B family; lepidopteran allatostatin) were reported. So far, only one allatotropin has been identified. Here we discuss latest literature on the multiplicity and multifunctionality of the allatoregulating neuropeptides, their physiological significance as well as their evolutionary conservation in structure and function.

N2  - Four peptides with allatostatic activity were isolated from brains of the Mediterranean field cricket, Gryllus bimaculatus. Three of them (Grb-AST A3: AGMYSFGL-NH2; Grb-AST A4: SRPFGFGL-NH2; Grb-AST A5: GPDHRFAFGL-NH2) belong to the wide-spread family of Y/FXFGL/I-amide peptides, the fourth (Grb-AST B5: AWDQLRPGW-NH2) is a member of the W2W9 - amide family of neuropeptides. All of these peptides are potent inhibitors of juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis by cricket corpora allata in vitro, causing 50% inhibition of JH biosynthesis at 0.4–3 × 10–8 M. The two peptides Grb-AST A5 and Grb-AST B5 have virtually the same potency and efficacy in inhibiting JH biosynthesis in vitro. No synergistic effect of the two peptide families with respect to the inhibition of JH biosynthesis could be observed. Peptides of both families decrease the accumulation of methylfarnesoate, the direct precursor of JH, within CA that have been incubated in farnesol-rich medium. This suggests an involvement of these ASTs in the late steps of JH biosynthesis.

N2  - Myotropic neuropeptides were isolated from the retrocerebral complex of the stick insect, Carausius morosus, by using three HPLC steps. Bioactivity during purification was measured by heterologous bioassays monitoring the contractions of the hyperneural muscle and hindgut of the American cockroach. Additionally, fractions not active in these bioassays were tested in a homologous bioassay evoking contractions of the hindgut of C. morosus. Peptide sequence analysis and mass spectrometry yielded the following structures: Pro-Phe-Cys-Asn-Ala-Phe-Thr-Gly-Cys-NH2 (CCAP), pGlu-Thr-Phe-Gln-Tyr-Ser-His-Gly-Trp-Thr-Asn-NH2 (His7-corazonin) and Asp-Glu-Gly-Gly-Thr-Gln-Tyr-Thr-Pro-Arg-Leu-NH2 (Cam-PK-1). These neuropeptides are the first myotropins isolated from C. morosus. The most bioactive compound in the homologous bioassay, the C. morosus-hindgut assay, was CCAP.

Both antisera yielded intense staining of numerous cells and nerve fibres. Serial sections, alternately stained with anti-A and anti-B confirmed that the anti-B generally stained more cells and nerves. Extensive immunoreactivity in the retrocerebral complex suggests that the CC and CA may represent a storage and/or release site for both allatostatin types or allatostatin-like molecules produced in the brain.

N2  - The nature and rate of juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis and effects of allatostatins and allatotropin have been investigated in isolated corpora allata (CA) of adults and larvae of the noctuid tomato moth, Lacanobia oleracea. In adult female CA, mean rates of synthesis were relatively constant (10–16 pmol/pr/h) at all times. However, the range of JH synthesis by individual CA of similarly aged insects was quite large (2–30 pmol/pr/h). High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation shows that adult female moth CA synthesise predominantly JH I and JH II. Rates of JH synthesis in vitro are dependent on methionine concentration. Synthetic Manduca sexta allatostatin (Mas-AS) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of JH synthesis by adult female CA but only to a max. of 54%, whilst 10 µM synthetic M. sexta allatotropin caused a 37% stimulation of CA activity. At 1 mM the cockroach allatostatin, Dip-allatostatin-2, had no significant effect on JH synthesis. In larval L. oleracea, rates of JH biosynthesis were very low (

N2  - Larval Manduca prothoracic gland cells in vitro responded to prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH) from neurosecretory cells of the brain with an increase of intracellular free calcium. This effect is reversible and dose-dependent. Preincubation of the glands with TMB-8 and dantrolene, which inhibit the release of calcium from intracellular stores, did not decrease the PTTH-stimulated increase in calcium, indicating that intracellular calcium stores are not involved in the control of ecdysteroidogenesis. Pharmacological studies of the PTTH effect with calcium channel blockers revealed that the increase in calcium was totally blocked by cadmium, partially inhibited by nickel and lanthanum and by amiloride, an antagonist of T-type calcium channels. All other inhibitors tested were ineffective, suggesting that the increase in cytosolic calcium is induced by opening of calcium channels, presumably of the T-type, in response to PTTH. The action of PTTH on these channels may be mediated by a G-protein as shown by the effect of mastoparan, a G-protein activator, which increased the concentration of cytosolic calcium comparable to that evoked by PTTH.

N2  - In view of the extremely high metabolic rates involved, insect flight offers a fascinating model system for studying metabolism during exercise, including its regulation by metabolic neurohormones. In our laboratory the African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, well-known for its long-distance flights, is used as an internationally recognized model insect. The insect is mass-reared under controlled conditions; its size permits convenient handling in vivo and in vitro, while flight activity can be easily evoked. In addition, research on this pest insect may be of economical importance. A survey of the energy metabolism during locust flight is presented in Fig. 1. Flight activity stimulates the neurosecretory adipokinetic cells in the glandular lobes of the corpus cardiacum, a neuroendocrine gland connected with the insect brain, to release peptide neurohormones, the adipokinetic hormones (AKHs). The target for these hormones is the fat body. Via signal transduction processes, the action of the hormones ultimately results in the mobilization of both carbohydrate and lipid reserves as fuels for flight. Carbohydrate (trehalose) is mobilized from glycogen reserves, implying hormonal activation of the key enzyme, fat body glycogen phosphorylase, by phosphorylation. Similarly, on the lipid side, sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) is mobilized from stored triacylglycerol (TAG), by hormonal activation of the fat body TAG lipase. The carbohydrate and lipid substrates are transported in the hemolymph to the contracting flight muscles. Carbohydrate provides most of the energy for the initial period of flight, whereas at a later stage, lipid substrate in the blood is increased and gradually takes over. The transport of DAG requires specific lipoprotein carriers (lipophorins) which differ in several respects from the lipoproteins in mammals, and act as a lipid shuttle.This review is focused on three interrelated topics, covering recent data on the biosynthesis and release of the AKHs, their signal transduction mechanisms in the fat body cells, and the changes in the lipophorin system induced by the AKHs during flight.

In contrast to the time- and material-consuming conventional methods of peptide purification and sequencing, substantial structural data of the peptide were confirmed – post factum – from one pCC (pair of CC) by Q-TOF mass spectrometry. Only males of our laboratory colony showed a significant lipid increase in the haemolymph after injection of either crude CC extract (1 pCC equivalent) or 10 pmol of synthetic peptide.

A vital step in the action of HTH to promote conversion of glycogen stored in the fat body to trehalose is the activation of phosphorylase. The means by which HTH activates phosphorylase, with particular emphasis on its role in the regulation of intracellular calcium, is discussed. Additional information supporting the view that HTH stimulated synthesis of trehalose, and possibly its release from the trophocyte, is regulated by fatty acids and eicosanoids is presented.

N2  - Insect peptidyl-dipeptidase A [angiotensin I – converting enzyme (ACE)] is a soluble single-domain peptidyl-dipeptidase that has many properties in common with the C-domain of mammalian somatic ACE and with the single-domain mammalian ACE. In agreement with a variety of insects, immunocytochemical studies reveal the presence of an ACE-like protein in Locusta migratoria. ACE-like immunoreactivity is present in neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis. These cells have axons projecting into the nervus corporis cardiaci I and into the storage part of the corpus cardiacum, a neuroendocrine organ directly releasing into the aorta. The localisation of ACE in neurosecretory cells is consistent with its proposed role as a processing enzyme that is involved in the generation of active peptide hormones.

N2  - Short-winged (brachypterous) and long-winged (macropterous) adult females of Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.) originating from a Mediterranean population (Israel) were analyzed for their adipokinetic responses. The adipokinetic response, expressed as an increase of haemolymph lipids after injection of adipokinetic hormone from Locusta migratoria (Lom-AKH-I), was assessed in relation to age and dose of the hormone. We demonstrate in this study that the adipokinetic responses induced by bug\'s corpora cardiaca extract and Lom-AKH-I were dose-dependent for both brachypterous and macropterous females. Significant differences between the morphs were recorded for doses >= 0.25 corpora cardiaca equivalent (P < 0.01) and doses >= 0.25 pmol Lom-AKH-I (P < 0.05). The haemolymph lipid elevations induced in both morphs by 2 pmols Lom-AKH-I are comparable with that induced by crude extract of one pair of the bug\'s own corpora cardiaca. The age-dependent test showed much higher adipokinetic responses (P < 0.01) in macropterous females (>= 5 days old) than in the brachypterous females of the same age, when treated with 2 pmols Lom-AKH-I. Starting from day 7, the concentration of haemolymph lipids was also considerably higher (2.5–5 times) in macropterous females than in the brachypterous ones. The obtained data indicate that difference in mobilization of lipids between brachypterous and macropterous females is a geographically independent feature and represents a true wing morph characteristic of P. apterus.

N2  - We measured energy substrates in haemolymph and flight muscles of the large blister beetle Mylabris oculata at rest and after tethered, lift-generating flight. Flight of 1 min duration at an ambient temperature of 38–42°C did not effect a change in the concentration of lipids in the haemolymph, whereas a small, significant decrease in the concentrations of carbohydrates and a 3-fold larger one in the levels of proline were noted, as well as a concomitant increase in alanine. In the flight muscles, glycogen and proline concentrations were diminished slightly but significantly upon flight, whereas alanine levels were increased. Two hours of rest after a flight of 1 min completely reversed the metabolic situation in haemolymph and flight muscles to pre-flight levels. We could isolate two neuropeptides from the corpora cardiaca of M. oculata, which by retention time and mass analyses are characterised as the decapeptide Del-CC (pGlu-Leu-Asn-Phe-Ser-Pro-Asn-Trp-Gly-Asn-NH2) and the octapeptide Tem-HrTH (pGlu-Leu-Asn-PheSer-Pro-Asn-Trp-NH2) previously fully identified from the corpora cardiaca of the blister beetle, Decapotoma lunata (Gäde, 1995). Subsequently, it was unequivocally demonstrated that low doses of Del-CC and Tem-HrTH elicited increases in the concentration of proline and carbohydrates in the haemolymph of D. lunata and M. oculata, but did not change the concentration of lipids in both species. In conclusion, the two endogenous peptides are hypertrehalosaemic and hyperprolinaemic, thus very likely regulating the mobilisation of the two important flight substrates of blister beetles, namely carbohydrates and proline.

N2  - Emp-AKH is a member of the large adipokinetic hormone (AKH) family of peptides. This peptide family appears to occur in the corpora cardiaca of all insect species and its members are involved in regulating substrate mobilisation. The secondary structure of Emp-AKH has been studied in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate micelles by comparing data obtained from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance and molecular dynamics simulations. The lowest energy conformer obtained in this study has a turn consisting of residues 5–8 and a tail consisting of the first five residues.

N2  - The occurrence of melatonin is known in nearly all organisms, but nothing is known exactly about its function outside of vertebrates. Long-term perifusions as well as short-term batch incubations of brains and moulting glands of the cockroach Periplaneta americana were used to identify the effect of melatonin on the release of prothoracicotropic hormone, a glandotropic neuropeptide in the brain, which stimulates the production of the moulting hormone ecdysone in the moulting gland. This is the first experimental evidence of a neurohormonal releasing effect of melatonin in the insect nervous system.

N2  - The profile of hemolymph ecdysteroid was studied in the gram pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera, during larval-pupal transformation. The changes closely correspond to the developmental events occurring at metamorphosis. Two insect growth regulators, plumbagin and azadirachtin, significantly depleted the content and altered the profile of ecdysteroids at crucial stages, when applied at ED50 doses. The activity profiles of two fat body lysosomal enzymes, acid phosphatase and b-galactosidase, were also significantly affected by the insect growth regulators. It is suggested that plumbagin and azadirachtin treatments primarily modify the ecdysteroid titer, which in turn leads to changes in lysosomal enzyme activity causing overt morphological abnormalities during the metamorphic molt.

N2  - From 1994–1997 the food of Coccinella septempunctata L. was investigated on the basis of gut dissections of adults and larvae collected in the field. Additionally, the gut contents of adults fed under laboratory conditions were investigated. The likelihood of recovering different prey types during gut dissection was variable, which will be illustrated by presenting some common prey fragments. The food eaten by adult C. septempunctata throughout a year was studied at a locality in Berlin-Staaken. Ladybirds were collected from March 1994 until November 1997 in different crops and habitats on roughly a monthly basis. Aphid feeding was detectable from April until October. In May and June they were the most frequent food type. Fungal spores, in most cases the conidia of Alternaria spp., became most frequent in July. Additionally non-aphid arthropods were frequently preyed upon in July. A very common non-aphid prey item were thrips. Pollen was important in May and September. Comparing the food components of newly emerged adults with those of overwintered adults some remarkable differences were detected. In newly emerged adults non-aphid arthropods and fungal spores were much more frequent than in overwintered adults whereas aphids were less frequently found. The diet of adults and larvae was also investigated in June and July in cereal fields at two other localities, Northern Flaeming and Magdeburger Boerde. No difference in adult diet was found between the three localities. The composition of the larval diet was relatively similar to that of the adults.

N2  - The effect of different host plants on Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) body size was investigated. Thrips from three different populations, from the Netherlands, Italy, and USA, achieved greater body sizes when reared on cucumber than on bean. The same thrips grew larger when reared on susceptible than on resistant cucumber. On the latter, reproduction was reduced, suggesting that smaller thrips have a lower reproduction. However, no evidence was found for a correlation between size and reproduction in experiments with thrips from four different populations, from the Netherlands, New Zealand, France, and USA that differed significantly in body size. Also when individual thrips from the four populations were tested, there was no correlation between size and reproduction. It is concluded that resistant cucumber affects both size and reproduction of F. occidentalis. However, lower reproduction in general is not associated with smaller body size.

N2  - The influence of host intrapatch spatial distribution on parasitoid host acceptance behavior was investigated with Trichogramma principium parasitizing eggs of grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella. Single females were placed in Petri dishes, each containing 60 host eggs arranged either as a compact patch or partitioned into 60 or 12 clusters each consisting of 1 or 5 eggs, respectively. Partitioned patches provoked parasitization more often than compact patches. The percentage of ovipositing females (i.e., females parasitizing at least one of 60 host eggs) increased with the number of clusters, while it was independent of the intercluster distance over intervals of 2.5–15 mm. The mean number of eggs parasitized by ovipositing females during 48 h was almost independent of the host egg spatial pattern. As a result, the rate of parasitization was higher when the hosts were sparsely distributed within a patch than when they were aggregated.

N2  - The efficiency of Monte-Carlo procedures to test some hypotheses about the spatial patterns of larvae and damages of Lobesia botrana was studied. Two hypotheses were tested to detect spatial heterogeneity and spatial dependence. The most practical implication is to provide an efficient sampling scheme. The study of the relationship between spatial patterns and grape availability was required to explain scales of spatial heterogeneity and population dynamics studies were needed to relate it to oviposition behavior. It was tested through a third hypothesis. We adapted Monte-Carlo simulation procedures for the analysis of exhaustive count data obtained from regular grids delimited within each of two vineyards. Statistical analyses were based on count permutations and on count redistributions according to the hypotheses which were tested. Indices of aggregation and autocorrelation statistics were used. The hypotheses that we tested at different scales were random distribution of the infestations (HR), independence of vine stock (or groups of k vine stocks) infestation (HI) and independence between vine stock infestation and grape availability (HG). Monte-Carlo tests revealed the same spatial patterns for larvae and damages. We detected different spatial patterns. The implications for sampling were that sample unit could be an individual stock and that sampling along a row could not be used to estimate population density in the vineyard. Results showed that infestation of a given stock depended on grape availability on this stock and on neighboring vine stocks.

N2  - Insect herbivores were collected from Castanopsis acuminatissima (Fagaceae) at Wau, Papua New Guinea, by beating the foliage of 15 trees during four one-month sampling periods, each representing different leaf-flush events. The association of leaf-chewing beetles with C. acuminatissima was verified with feeding trials. Of 59 species of leaf-chewing beetles that were collected, 36 species could be used in feeding trials. Only 9 of these species fed on C. acuminatissima. A further 27 beetle species were tested in feeding trials but did not feed. Of these, 7 were specialists feeding on other tree species within the surrounding vegetation. Most beetle species collected from C. acuminatissima foliage were probably transient species, dispersing from other tree species. Path analyses showed that herbivore abundance during a particular sampling period was significantly influenced by rainfall, leaf flush of other conspecific trees and air temperature, but not so by the species richness of surrounding vegetation, number of surrounding conspecific trees and size (DBH) of trees sampled. The species richness of leaf-chewing beetles collected on particular study trees depended on that of the surrounding vegetation, thus supporting the hypothesis that most beetle species collected were transient. The abundance of insect herbivores on particular C. acuminatissima trees probably depends on a balance between the leaf flush of conspecific trees and that of the particular tree sampled. The results also emphasize the need to remove transient species in analyses of insect faunas of tropical trees, at the risk of analyzing species richness patterns derived from loosely defined "assemblages” of species.

N2  - Four species of Anagrus (A. breviphragma Soyka, A. incarnatus Haliday, A. fennicus Soyka and A. obscurus Foerster sensu Soyka), that live on Carex riparia Curtis (Cyperaceae) in uncultivated areas along the Po river in the Piacenza province in Italy were analysed using RAPD markers in order to investigate their genetic relationships. High levels of RAPD polymorphism were found in the genus Anagrus, which permitted the fingerprinting of the four species. Analysis of average genetic similarities within species and comparison with average values between species confirms that A. breviphragma, A. incarnatus, A. fennicus and A. obscurus represent four genetically distinct species. A dendrogram constructed from molecular data of single families clearly clustered the four species in different groups, their mutual position reflecting morphological and biological observations.

N2  - A. schneideri and A. grossulariae clones from southern Poland produced fertile hybrid eggs under experimental conditions. Established hybrid clones expressed normal parthenogenetic reproduction but bisexual generations were not obtained, though a few sexuales developed in some cases. Morphological features of A. schneideri and host-specificity of A. grossulariae tended to dominate in the majority of hybrid clones. Independent inheritance of the studied morphological characters and host specificity can therefore be presumed.Present results do not exclude the possibility of natural hybridisation of studied aphid species. Natural crosses might cause taxonomic and currant pest management problems.

N2  - The cixiid planthopper Hyalesthes obsoletus Signoret is an efficient vector of the stolbur phytoplasma, the cause of various crop diseases. In the field, this monovoltine species feeds on a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants. It overwinters as larvae on the roots of its host plants. During this study, we collected adults mainly from lavender (Lavendula angustifolia Miller), bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L. and C. sepium L.), hoary cress (Cardaria draba L.), and occasionally from plantain (Plantago cynops L.), toadflax (Linaria striata L.), bedstraw (Galium verum L.), and mountain savory (Satureia montana L.). Fertility of field collected females from sites at two different elevations differed significantly. Fertility at 300 m (50.6 eggs per female; N = 28) was more than twice that at 900 m (22.8 eggs per female; N = 19). Only one specimen of the species was found to be parasitized by an undetermined species of Dryinidae (Hymenoptera). H. obsoletus was reared in controlled conditions on lavender. Unlike in the field, larvae developed in the laboratory at the base of the host plant and on basal shoots. Egg incubation averaged 7 ± 1.2 weeks (N = 10). Total development time from egg to adult averaged 27 ± 4 weeks (N = 5) on lavender. A morphological description of the five instars is provided. The study was supplemented by scanning electron microscopy. Particular attention was paid to the structure of the wax-plates and the absence of compound eyes in the early larval stages.

N2  - Female hybrids of the cross Chironomus t. thummi female × Ch. t. piger male which are largely affected by the sterility inducing Rud syndrome were backcrossed with males of both parental strains. The aim of the study was to provide information about those egg volumes that are insufficient for a normal embryogenesis and to ascertain whether in the hybrids the lethally small egg size represents a new abnormal trait of the Rud syndrome. The egg masses obtained contain eggs of very different sizes with volumes ranging from 0.5 nl to 3.49 nl. Embryo mortality is unusually frequent in those eggs of the backcrosses and of the parental strains that have volumes smaller than 1.5 nl. An egg volume of 1.5 nl represents in Ch. thummi the lower limit for those volumes that are sufficient for a normal embryogenesis. Mortality increases with decreasing egg size, reaching 100% in backcross eggs with volumes of 0.99 nl and smaller. Small egg size is a new trait of the Rud syndrome affected thummi female × piger male hybrids. This trait is part of a postzygotic reproductive isolation barrier between thummi and piger and manifests first in the backcrosses. Most backcross eggs show volumes between 1.5 nl and 2.99 nl. Within this volume range the amount of mortality does not depend upon egg volume. Here, embryo death is great in the backcrosses but normal in the parental strains. The high frequency of embryo death in the backcrosses must be predominantly due to the action of the Rud syndrome and a second hybrid syndrome, called HLE syndrome. Since further characteristic traits of these syndromes could be detected in surviving backcross individuals, the study demonstrates the occurrence of the syndromes in this generation also. Therefore, the postzygotic reproductive isolation mechanism of both hybrid syndromes is effective in the hybrids and in their progeny as well.

N2  - Allozyme polymorphism was investigated in adult males of the stenotopic peat bog (tyrphobiontic) noctuid moth, Coenophila subrosea Stephens, from three isolated peat bog localities in Austria (Styria) and Czech Republic (South and North Bohemia). Of the eighteen enzyme loci examined, twelve were polymorphic and six monomorphic. Significant deviations of genotype frequencies from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were observed at about one third of polymorphic loci within the populations. The average heterozygosities for the populations from three geographically distinct localities ranged from 0.192 to 0.245, and 61% of the loci were polymorphic. The FST mean value of 0.0675 was higher than that found in most other Lepidoptera. The genetic distances based on allozyme heterozygosity ranged from 0.019 to 0.051, with the population from South Bohemia being the most distant. The genetic distances and FST values do not reflect the geographic distances between the populations. Morphometric analysis revealed a difference between the Austrian Purgschachen Moor and Bohemian populations. These isolated relict peat bogs are habitat islands inhabited by unique \"geographical races\" of tyrphobiontic taxa.

N2  - In the laboratory, not all females of the seed bug Lygaeus simulans Deckert, 1985, produced fertilized eggs after copulation: 26.7% of the females were not inseminated and 5% were inseminated but did not lay fertilized eggs; only in 40% of the couples did copulation result in fertile eggs. The remaining 28.3% of couples refrained from mating. Duration of copulation was associated with insemination and fertilization: (i) fertile eggs were produced by only one couple that copulated for less than 60 min and all those that copulated for more than 360 min, (ii) probability of fertilization increased steadily with duration of copulation between 60 and 360 min, and (iii) duration of copulation was significantly different for couples that showed different insemination status. A possible morphological explanation for this rime dependency was revealed by examining the genitalia of 69 couples freeze-fixed in copula after different periods in copulation. Because of the intricate structure of the genitalia in L. simulans, a male takes a long time to manoeuver its intromittent organ into the narrow insemination duct of the female. Only if completely inserted is the tip of the intromittent organ close enough for successful ejaculation of sperm into the spermatheca. The freeze-fixing experiment revealed that it usually took the male more than 30 min to locate the entrance to the insemination duct and another 30 min for full penetration. This explains why copulations that lasted less than 60 min failed, since insemination began only after intromission was complete.The experiments, therefore, indicated that there is a relationship between the complex morphology of the genitalia and the low rates of insemination and fertilization in L. simulans.

N2  - Adult diapause in Riptortus clavatus (Thunberg) was induced by short-day photoperiods, and the critical daylength for its induction was 13.5 h. When insects were reared from eggs under diapause-inducing photoperiods near the critical daylength, the duration of diapause was shorter than when reared under the shorter daylengths. Adults terminated diapause under long-day photoperiods earlier when they had been raised under a near-critical photoperiod than under shorter daylengths; this indicated that the initial intensity of diapause was dependent on the length of the inducing photoperiod. Not only the photoperiods experienced during preimaginal development but also the value of the long-day photoperiods experienced after adult emergence affected the time of onset of oviposition. When the photophase was shortened, either abruptly or gradually after adult emergence, the duration of diapause was prolonged. Diapause was long when induced by shorter daylengths than the near-critical photoperiod. Different photoperiods have thus different quantitative effects on both the initial intensity of diapause and the rate of diapause development.

N2  - A possibility of using synthetic analogues of juvenile hormone (juvenoids) to disrupt imaginal diapause of the apple blossom weevil, Anthonomus pomorum females was demonstrated. Out of three preparations tested (methoprene, fenoxycarb and W-328) methoprene and fenoxycarb appeared to be effective. Sensitivity to juvenile hormone analogues develops early after imaginal emergence (even before the female starts to feed) and lasts throughout the whole aestivo-hibernation dormancy. Although the juvenoids could stimulate the onset of oogenesis at any time during diapause, the propensity of the ovaries to form normal eggs developed only during hibernation part of the dormancy; in earlier stages of diapause accumulation of yolk was observed but matured eggs were not produced. Methoprene treatment caused marked increase of locomotory activity accompanied with decrease of dry weight, increase of water content, depletion of trehalose resources, decrease of cold hardiness and, finally, 100% mortality within four weeks in the weevils treated during their feeding or aestivation stages. Although similar changes were observed in the treated pre-feeding weevils, they later recovered and survived until next spring without apparent loss of cold hardiness. A possibility of designing a control method based on this principle is discussed and the results of small-scale field trials that support its plausibility are reported.

N2  - Oviposition behaviour of Delia radicum is not only influenced by host plant duality but also by the duality of the substrate in which the plant grows. Direct behavioural observations showed that the females partition their visits to a host plant (cauliflower) into ovipositional bouts separated by exploration of the host plant surface. Ovipositional bouts were further partitioned into acts of egg deposition separated by exploration of the substrate. While the mean number of ovipositional bouts per visit (2.6), and eggs laid per egg deposition event (1.4) were stable, the mean number of egg deposition events per ovipositional bout significantly varied (from 2.1 to 7.3) with the duality of the substrate and the physiological state of the female (egg load). Ovipositing females adjusted the final number of eggs laid around the plant during the behavioural stage of substrate exploration. Additional experiments using plant surrogates treated with methanolic extract of Brassica leaves mounted in different substrates showed that: (a) the presence of living Brassica, Hordeum or Allium roots in a substrate enhances the number of eggs laid into this substrate, but females do not discriminate between the different plants; (b) females avoid both wet and dry substrates and prefer the substrates with a dry surface and moist particles directly accessible at a depth of about 5 mm; (c) substrates rich in organic matter are preferred to sand; (d) olfactory perception of volatile chemicals from the substrate must at least partial

N2  - Ceratophysella sigillata uses protrusible vesicles on its antennae and posterior end as sticky landing devices to avoid tumbling upon landing. This technique facilitates its orientated movement during winter migration. It allows the animal to use directional jumps without rebounding even when climbing tree trunks. The antennal vesicles are present only in the surface active morphs of C. sigillata, and only these individuals jump readily. The vesicles are everted only when the animal has time to prepare the jump. In an escape leap, they are not protruded and therefore the animal tumbles upon landing.

N2  - Data on the webs, prey spectrum, density and fecundity of Theridion impressum from three different habitats [fields of sunflower, fiddleneck (Phacelia), and apple trees] are presented and discussed. The volume of webs were found to vary between 5 (the first free instar) to 117 cm3 (subadult and adult specimens). The mean density of adult spiders per plant was 0.7 (sunflower), 1.5 (fiddleneck) and 1.2 (per apple branch). Spiders preferred to build webs in the upper part of vegetation or at the extremities of tree branches. The prey spectrum was assessed by collecting webs and identifying their contents. Prey items were primarily aphids (73%), Diptera (7.5%), acid Coleoptera and Hymenoptera (both 5.4%). Pests comprised 90% of the prey; the remaining 10% was accounted for by natural enemies, pollinators and other insects. The number of insects captured in webs differed among study habitats (sunflower > fiddleneck > apple tree) though this difference was not statistically significant. Due to greater numbers of aphids in webs on sunflower, the mean prey length was significantly smaller on sunflowers than in other plots. An index of fecundity was obtained by counting the number of eggs in eggsacs. This varied from 48 to 156 per eggsac and was not significantly different between study plots. The number of eggs was strongly correlated with numbers of prey captured per spider.

N2  - The efficacy of morphometric characters for separating the species of the genus Aspidiotes Schoenherr, 1847, was evaluated. Thirty characters were analyzed. Multivariate and univariate analyses of variance, and discriminant function analysis, all dem onstrated that each species is morphometrically distinguishable. The lengths of rostrum, scape, onychium, pronotum, and width and length of elytra have the maximum discriminatory power. Males and females are also morphometrically distinguishable, mainly due to differences in the widths of rostrum between pterigia and at base of pronotum, and width and length of elytra. The classification functions provided by discriminant gave the correct identification of every single specimen by sex and species. Mahalanobis\' distances between species were calculated and subjected to UPGMA clustering, to construct a dendrogram reflecting the morphometric relationships between species. This dendrogram did not correspond to the phylogenetic relationships depicted by a cladogram based on discrete characters (Sánchez-Ruiz & Alonso-Zarazaga, 1994). Some hypotheses are reviewed, which might explain this discrepancy.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships among Palaearctic species of the ant genus Tetramorium and its social parasites of the genera Strongylognathtus, Anergates and Teletomyrmex, were investigated electrophoretically at 21 presumptive enzyme loci. The data set comprising 33 species was analysed with distance (UPGMA, Neighbor-joining and least squares statistics) and parsimony methods (independent allele, minimum turnover and mutation coding) in order to rule out analysis-dependent effects. Several groupings were consistently resolved by all procedures. Observed branching patterns support the placement of the three parasite genera and their hosts into the Palaearctic species group of Tetramorium (tribe Tetramoriini). The genus Strongylognathus forms a monophyletic group in which the slave-makers of the S. huberi group constitute the sister group of the inquilines S. testaceus and S. karawajewi (S. testaceus group). Most species of the S. huberi group show very low genetic differentiation. However, little consensus has been found with regard to which Tetramorium species are the closest relatives of Strongylognathus. According to the electrophoretic data, social parasitism in Palaearctic tetramoriine ants has evolved independently at least twice. Though inquilinism once arose from slave-making ancestors in Strongylognathus, the extreme inquilines Anergates atratulus and Teleutomyrmex schneideri are clearly set apart from the Strongylognathus clade in phylogenetic analyses. Thus, extreme inquilinism cannot be regarded as the endpoint of a single parasitic lineage in the Tetramoriini. In these highly advanced inquilines, evolutionary rates at allozyme loci appear to be higher than those of their Tetramorium hosts. The results do not unambiguously reveal whether Anergates and Teleutomyrmex arose jointly or independently from Tetramorium ancestors. However, a combined analysis using all available evidence supports the former hypothesis. The finding that the Tetramorium parasites are not the closest relatives of their respective host species is discussed in relation to current theories for the evolution of social parasitism.

Females that: attended aggregations of 2nd and later instar nymphs feeding on fruit of inflorescences often settled close to the basal part of or just below the aggregation, and faced towards the base of the inflorescence. The nymphal aggregations often Seemed to be too large for females to guard effectively. The position and orientation of females attending 2nd or later instar nymphs probably enabled them to detect predators walking towards the nymphs.

N2  - Respiratory metabolism of developing eggs of Schistocerca gregaria has been individually monitored by means of scanning microrespirography. The freshly oviposited eggs consumed 7 nl of O2 /min./egg (50 µl O2/g/h) while the pharate 1st instar larvae shortly before hatching consumed 141 nl of O2/min./egg (550 µl O2/g/h), which shows 20-fold metabolic increase during the egg stage. The output of CO2 was also regular, without discontinuous bursts throughout the whole embryonic development. The amounts of CO2 produced were constantly close to R.Q. ratio of 0.7, suggesting that lipid was the main energetic source. The vermiform, pharate 1st instar larvae emerging from the eggs exhibited very high respiratory rates (up to 3,000 µl O2/g/h). During initial phases of the egg stage, O2 consumption steadily increased until day 6, which was associated with katatrepsis or blastokinesis stage of the embryo (61 nl of O2/egg/min. = 240 µl O2/g/h). Since blastokinesis, respiratory metabolism of the egg remained constant or decreased steadily until day 10, when it rose sharply again towards hatching. The temporary metabolic depression was closely correlated with endogenous peak in ecdysteroid concentration within the embryo. These results corroborate validity of the reciprocal, high ecdysteroid – low metabolism rule previously known from insect metamorphosis. They extend its application into the period of embryogenesis. Practical implications of certain physiological, morphological and evolutionary consequences of these findings are discussed with special emphasis on the connecting links between embryogenesis and metamorphosis.

N2  - The cold hardiness of individuals from overwintering populations of a freeze susceptible bug Pyrrhocoris apterus from central and southern Europe differed significantly. Supercooling point (SCP) correlated well with both lethal temperature (LT50) and lethal time (Lt50), and is agood index of cold hardiness of adults during and after diapause. In January, diapause terminated, but cold hardiness was similar to that recorded in November; cold hardiness decreased slightly in March and markedly in May. Short exposure (less than a week) to higher temperatures before termination of diapause did not reduce the cold hardiness. Cold hardiness did not closely follow air temperatures.The Bulgarian bugs retained lower cold hardiness regardless of acclimation to harsh field conditions in the Czech Republic. The interpopulation difference is therefore a heritable character representing an adjustment to local climates.

N2  - Episyrphus balteatus only matures eggs after emergence. Ovaries develop in 4 stages. In the absence of oviposition sites, females refrain from ovipositing and their ovaries progressively fill the abdomen and then egg resorption occurs. The potential fecundity, which is expressed by the ovariole number, the reproductive biomass and the abdomen volume, scales isometrically with the size of females. Egg size is much less variable and does not rise proportionally to body size. In laboratory conditions, females of E. balteatus might lay between 2,000 and 4,500 eggs during their life-time at a rate of 1 to 2 eggs per ovariole per day. Both life-time fecundity and rate of egg production are directly related to the size of females. The potential and realized fecundities are likely to be limited by the availability of food resources during larval and adult life, respectively.

N2  - The reproductive biology (drumming call, mating behaviour, fecundity and egg structure) of Isoperla curtata, an endemic species from the Southern Iberian Peninsula, is described. The male’s mating call has a diphasic pattern, with a mean of 17.3 beats per call (range = 8–27; SD = 4.7) and a duration of 792.9 ms per call (range = 228–1312; SD = 307.9). This call differs from that of other species of Isoperla in having two distinct phases with different millisecond intervals, and is species-specific. Mating lasts between 131 and 3864 seconds (mean = 2180.9 s and SD = 1027.8). Since males and females mate more than once (mean number of matings per female was 1.85 and per male 2.25), the species is polyandric and polygynic. The position adopted by the male during mating is different from that described for other stonefly species. Other mating behaviours are interpreted as displacement manoeuvers, tactile stimulation and possibly sexual selection by cryptic female choice. There was a statistically significant correlation between size and the number of matings in females (r = 0.849; p = 0.016), but not in males. Each female laid between one to four egg masses composed of an average of 88.7 eggs. Maximum fecundity was 319 eggs. The mean egg volume was 80.5 × 105 µm3 which is very similar to that of other Isoperla species. An outstanding morphological characteristic of the egg is the lobed outline of the chorion cells.

N2  - The parasitoid, Anagyrus kamali Moursi (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae), has been recently introduced into the Caribbean as a biological control agent against the hibiscus mealybug (HMB), Maconellicoccus hirsutus Green (Homoptera: Pseudococcidae). Storage of A. kamali that is essential for its use in biological control did not affect the longevity of female and male parasitoids (40.3 ± 14.07 and 31.7 ± 9.57 days, respectively) when kept at 20 ± 2°C in absence of hosts and fed ad libitum with droplets of pure honey. At a storage temperature of 27 ± 2°C the longevity decreased by about 10 days. Fed females did not resorb eggs during the first two weeks of storage at 20 ± 2°. Parasitoid ovogenesis ceased when ovarioles/lateral oviducts were full. The lifetime fecundity was not significantly affected by a storage at 20 ± 2°C of up to 14 days. Foraging activities and oviposition were the main factors influencing the lifespan of female A. kamali.

N2  - Populations of the specialist gall-forming fly, Urophora cardui (Diptera: Tephritidae), were studied at the western and eastern margins of its distribution. In western Europe U. cardui attacks the creeping thistle Cirsium arvense, whereas in eastern Europe, in the Ural mountains, it attacks Cirsium setosum, a taxon closely related to C. arvense. Gall densities are high in the Ural mountains and can be predicted by environmental variables. Compared to galls on C. arvense, those on C. setosum are on average larger. This indicates better performance of U. cardui on C. setosum in terms of cell numbers per gall. Despite the wide distribution of U. cardui, the dominant parasitoids are the same at the western and eastern ends of its distribution and the interactions between parasitoids and the host are similar. In general, we suggest that the synchronisation between the host plant species, the phytophage and the parasitoids is an important factor in the spatial ecology and evolution of this food web.

N2  - The absolute population density of adult Pardosa agrestis (Westring, 1862), the dominant epigeic spider species in many arable lands in Central Europe, was quantified in two alfalfa fields using a multiple mark-recapture method. The resulting density estimates are presented together with catch data from simultaneously performed suction sampling and pitfall trapping. Two week long mark-recapture surveys were conducted in August 1995 and 1996 using grids of 11 × 11 live-catching pitfall traps covering a square area of 400 m2 in the first, and 900 m2 in the second survey. The trap checking and marking procedure, using individual codes, was done daily. Over 5,000 spiders were marked in the two surveys. The number of spiders caught varied greatly between days. The recapture rate was also variable, ranging between 5–19%. Recaptured animals moved considerable daily distances, marked animals left the area of the trapping grid within a few days. Population sizes were estimated for 3 day time windows during which period the population could be considered closed. Spider densities were calculated from the estimated abundances and the capture area, which consisted of the grid area plus a boundary strip calculated from the estimated movement ranges of spiders. The resulting densities were close to 2 males and 1 female per m2 in the first, and 4.5 males and 4.5 females per m2 in the second experimental site. Suction sampling caught very few adult individuals and gave unsatisfactory data for statistical comparison. Live catching pitfall trap catches did not correlate with the derived mark-recapture density estimates across the short time windows, but for the entire trapping sessions the catches were consistent with the density estimates.

N2  - The south east Asian pest thrips, Thrips parvispinus is recorded breeding in Europe for the first time, damaging Gardenia plants in Greece. Morphological variation in this species from various Asian countries is recorded and compared to the type specimens. As a result Isoneurothrips jenseni Karny, 1925 and Thrips (Isoneurothrips) taiwanus Takahashi, 1936 are placed as synonyms of Thrips parvispinus (Karny, 1922). In contrast, Thrips compressicornis (Sakimura), a species from the Marquesa Islands of the Pacific that has previously been associated with these taxa, represents a very different species. The quarantine significance of T. parvispinus is emphasised.

A key to genera is provided separately for the first- and older-instar larvae. Monophyly and phylogenetic position of the subtribes and genera are discussed on the basis of presumably apomorphic character states of larvae. Based on at least six synapomorphic character states the subtribes Tachyina and Xystosomina appear to form a monophyletic group. On the other hand, there are no synapomorphies to propose a sister-group relationship between Tachyina and Xystosomina within the supertribe Trechitae.

N2  - To establish the importance of different cues for feeding site location in aphids, two birch-feeding species were given access to leaves that were either orientated normally or inverted. Euceraphis betulae used gravity and/or light as the main cue, and settled on the surface that was orientated down. Monaphis antennata additionally used leaf surface features to locate its feeding site, and approximately half of the individuals settled on the correct feeding surface whatever its orientation. This is one of the few examples of positive stimuli being used by aphids during feeding site location.

N2  - The stereotypical sperm is characterised as being tiny but produced in great quantities. However a few species (frequently insects) produce much larger spermatozoa, probably with an associated cost in reduced numbers per ejaculate. Here I present the first evidence that a species within the Lepidoptera also produces giant sperm. It seems likely that given wider sampling this record for the largest sperm produced by a lepidopteran may subsequently be broken.

N2  - Some previous work on arthropod development is insufficiently detailed or incompletely reported. Much of the published information in this area is of limited use for the general analysis of life cycles. These difficulties arise primarily because many experiments do not control fully for the strain of the material (and even its specific identity) nor for rearing conditions, do not adequately take account of the complexity of life cycles and their stages, or are restricted to only part of the life cycle. For example, 285such factors as variable numbers of instars, sexual differences, abbreviated or hidden stages and dormancies may mean that the "average durations” reported apply to an unknown mixture of developmental types. Nor are experiments always designed or results reported and analysed in a logical and transparent manner. Undefined terms may obscure what actual developmental intervals were measured. Highly derived developmental or demographic measures may obscure core data. Statistical information may be inadequate. Such pitfalls are reviewed here, suggesting ways to ensure that results on the duration of development are both valid for specific studies and more widely useful. General experimental difficulties, recommended background information that should be provided, recommended life-cycle intervals and their terminology, and recommended ways to report numerical and statistical information are briefly summarized in tabular form.

N2  - Female genitalia of lygaeid bugs are characterized by a tube-shaped ductus receptaculi (spermathecal duct) connecting the bursa copulatrix with the highly coiled receptaculum seminis (spermatheca). In this study the morphology and functional anatomy of these structures in Lygaeus simulans were examined by light-, fluorescence- and electron microscopy. In addition, copulating animals were freeze fixed and their interconnected genital structures observed using light microscopy. The ductus receptaculi is separated from the receptaculum seminis by a complicated valve. The valve is nearly surrounded by the spermathecal muscle, which controls its opening. The ductus receptaculi leads into the proximal convoluted tube of the receptaculum seminis. Both the ductus receptaculi and the convoluted tube are composed of a single layer of epithelial cells lined by a thick electron dense apical cuticle. The distal part of the receptaculum seminis is a brownish, irregularly coiled, blind ending canal made of small epithelial cells covered with cuticle. Big glands are present in the epidermal layer. The cuticle of this distal part is much thinner and features concentric lamellae. The lumen of the receptaculum seminis cannot be expanded. For transfering sperm into the receptaculum the male aedeagus is equipped with a long, tube-like, sclerotized appendix (processus gonopori), which enlarges the ductus receptaculi considerably during copulation. For successful insemination the tip of the processus gonopori has to pass the valve. The convoluted tube, the valve and the surrounding spermathecal muscle may enable females to control insemination and egg fertilization.

N2  - Bethylid wasps are a medium sized family of parasitic Hymenoptera, with biological control potential, which have recently proved excellent model systems for testing evolutionary and life history theory. We report observations on a species of Laelius from The Netherlands. The species is morphologically indistinguishable from Laelius pedatus, previously reported only from the New World. Reciprocal crosses between the Dutch wasps and L. pedatus from Madison, Wisconsin, USA confirmed that the Dutch population belongs to L. pedatus. We compared the life history of the Dutch wasps with those from Madison by rearing them on Trogoderma glabrum, but found no significant differences. The Dutch wasps successfully parasitize Trogoderma angustum, an invasive museum and domestic pest found in situ, but suffer high developmental mortality on T. glabrum. Wasp egg size was positively correlated with the size of ovipositing female, which was also negatively correlated with the developmental mortality of offspring. Larger wasps also carried more mature eggs. Time taken to lay the clutch increased with the size of the eventual clutch laid and was longer in unmated than mated females. When some wasps died before completing development, surviving members of the brood grew to a larger size and took longer to complete development. The number of males per brood increased with previous oviposition experience, an indication of sperm depletion through life. We discuss the implications of these trends for parasitoid life history theory.

N2  - The body length variation, sex ratio, ovarian development and natural enemies (parasitoids and entomopathogenic fungi) of Coccinella septempunctata were studied during two dormancy seasons in three hibernation sites in the Karkonosze mountains: the top of Mt. Œnie¿ka (1,600 m a.s.l.), the top of Mt. Szrenica (1,360 m a.s.l.) and Karpacz, the village at the foot of Mt. Œnie¿ka (800 m a.s.l.). The proportion of females and mean body length increased with the altitude of the hibernaculum. Post-diapause maturation of ovaries occurred earlier in spring in females from Karpacz than from the mountain tops. The rate of parasitization of C. septempunctata by its most common parasitoid, the braconid Dinocampus coccinellae, in both seasons exceeded 70% at Karpacz and was 14–28% in the mountain top hibernacula. In contrast, the incidence of fungal infection (mainly by Paecilomyces farinosus and Beauveria bassiana) was higher in beetles overwintering on the two mountain tops.

The study is based on data of the annual activity patterns in the natural habitat, on anatomical observations related to the sex and age of the specimens, on the reproductive condition of females and, finally, on the results of laboratory rearing experiments carried out to study the oviposition patterns and the course of development of immature stages. The results indicate that C. dufouri shows the annual rhythm of autumn breeders. However, the rhythm may also be related to the winter-breeder type of North Africa.

The use of two Malaise traps in an organically-grown spring barley field and its boundary through 6 seasons (1992–1997) also allowed us to compare these two habitats and to observe the effect of harvesting on the parasitoid activity without interference from pesticides. C. fuscula overwinters as an adult and oviposits in May/June. Few specimens of the next generation, emerging in the crop, were caught in the boundary traps, suggesting the fly hibernates elsewhere. In contrast, the F1 generation of the parasitoids was caught in considerable amounts both in the crop and boundary. The abundance of parasitoids was highest in July/August; in the crop it usually started decreasing well before harvesting; in the boundary it peaked two weeks or more after harvesting. The results suggest that many parasitoids (especially females) move from the crop to the boundary (or beyond) before harvesting. In both habitats parasitoid species richness usually increased until harvesting, and thereafter decreased. The pooled parasitoid female proportion was 0.36; in crop and boundary it was 0.30 and 0.66, respectively, and the majority of species had a higher proportion of females in the boundary than in the crop. The phenology of two of the most common parasitoids is presented: The pupal parasitoid Cyrtogaster vulgaris Walker (Pteromalidae) had a high activity in the boundary, also very early (females only) and late (both sexes) in the season. The larval parasitoid Diglyphus begini (Ashmead) (Eulophidae) was less active early and late in the season, and had a much smaller boundary activity than C. vulgaris. Both sexes were present throughout the season. The annual sex ratio of D. begini was density dependent, being highly male biased in the two years with highest catches. In C. vulgaris neither density nor habitat explained the sex ratio. D. begini probably overwinters inside the mine as a preadult, having one generation on C. fuscula in the crop and another one in an alternate host away from the habitats sampled here. C. vulgaris overwinters as fertilized females in the border habitat.

N2  - Monoctonus paulensis is a solitary parasitoid of several species of aphids, including the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. We evaluated host-instar selection by comparing the parasitoid’s preference for the four nymphal instars of the pea aphid, presented two at a time in dichotomous choice tests. Females parasitized more, and laid more eggs in, the relatively smaller aphids among those available. This preference was independent of aphid instar: L1 > L2 > L3 > L4. Preference was not influenced by female size or age. Normal and anaesthetized aphids were accepted equally. The total time needed by a female to capture, position, and parasitize an aphid varied among host instars, with fourth instars requiring nearly twice as much time as first, second, and third instars. The probability of an attacked aphid escaping or avoiding parasitism increased with aphid instar, from ~10% in first and second instars to ~50% in fourth instars. Although fourth-instar pea aphids contain more resources for offspring development than smaller counterparts, it may not be profitable for a female to invest opportunity time in attacks on large aphids.

N2  - The development of the solitary endoparasitic braconid Glyptapanteles porthetriae in gypsy moth larvae of different ages was studied. Host larvae were parasitized during the premolt to the 2nd instar (A-larvae), to the 3rd instar (B-larvae) or to the 4th instar (C-larvae), respectively. The percentage of successfully parasitized larvae decreased markedly with the age of the host at the time of parasitization. When parasitization occurred at the premolt to the second or third instar, parasitoid larvae successfully emerged at rates of 68% and 57%, respectively, in contrast to the 17% from larvae parasitized in the premolt to the fourth instar. In all three groups of parasitized larvae the final host instar was significantly longer than the corresponding instar of unparasitized control larvae of the same age. However, the growth and growth rate of parasitized larvae were reduced compared to control larvae. Due to the extremely low rate of successful development of G. porthetriae in C-larvae, parameters of parasitoid development were only recorded in A and B-host larvae. In both the parasitoid growth was slow during the first instar but rapidly increased during the second instar. Total developmental time of the parasitoid was significantly longer in B-host larvae, and the resultant cocoons were heavier than those that developed in A-host larvae, but proportionally fewer of the offspring were females. Within both groups the female wasps took significantly longer to develop than the males.

N2  - The large copper butterfly, Lycaena dispar batavus, a subspecies of much conservation interest, is host-specific to the great water dock, Rumex hydrolapathum, but little is known of the relationship between herbivore and host in wild populations. This study investigated the distribution of both R. hydrolapathum plants and L. d. batavus eggs in four different habitat types within the Weerribben National Park, The Netherlands, during the summer of 1993. As expected, host plant distribution strongly influenced that of its herbivore. Further, both species had significantly aggregated distributions, and that of R. hydrolapathum was in agreement with the negative binomial model. Host plant selection for oviposition showed no significant relationship with physical plant characteristics, such as plant height and the number of leaves, and at the scale studied, habitat type was of only limited influence. The possible influence of the vegetational architecture surrounding host plants is discussed.

N2  - The spider community of a beech forest on limestone was studied for one year using four sampling techniques: emergence traps, pitfall traps, soil samples, and arboreal eclectors. 87 spider species were recorded. Emergence traps and arboreal eclectors were particularly efficient in detecting spider species. Dominance identity (percentage similarity) was highest for catches from emergence traps and pitfall traps. Species recorded were assigned to various ecological groups. In terms of proportional abundance, representation of the ecological groups varied and appeared related to the sampling method used. Stratum type and type of prey capture strategy accounted for >60% of the variance in the catch results (canonical correspondence analysis). Proportional abundance of funnel-web spiders was much higher in pitfall trap catches (31.7%) than in any other method (1.0–11.6%).

Established hybrid clones expressed normal parthenogenetic reproduction but bisexual generations were obtained only in three hybrid clones out of twenty six. Fertile F1 hybrid eggs were obtained in one hybrid clone. Morphological and host-specificity features of A. grossulariae dominated in the majority of hybrid clones. The present results do not exclude the possibility of natural hybridisation of studied aphid species. Natural hybrids may be difficult to detect because of their "pure” morphological and host-specificity features.

N2  - SSCP (single-strand conformation polymorphism) analyses of ubiquitin genes were used to investigate evolutionary relationships within the subgenus Orinocarabus of the genus Carabus. After SSCP electrophoresis of PCR-amplified ubiquitin copies, population-specific band patterns were obtained. Ubiquitin-SSCP-analyses of the six central European Orinocarabus species, including three subspecies and thirteen populations, resulted in a dendrogram that differed from that based on morphology. Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) did not support the SSCP dendrogram, but was in good accordance with the taxonomy based on morphological characters. The reason for the discrepancies seems to be evolutionary conservation of the ubiquitin genes. The time that elapsed since the evolution of the closely related Orinocarabus species is too short for concerted evolution of the ubiquitin genes.

The common characters of both species, and the specific diagnostic characters are provided and discussed. The most important morphological characters of the larvae of Plagiogonus Mulsant, 1842 are the longitudinal alignment of the anterior setae of the stipes, the spatulate form of the posterior-lateral setae of the glossae of the hypopharynx, the slight development of the anal lobe slit, the form of the epitorma of the epipharynx, the slight sclerotization of the pternotormae and the relative length of second antennal segment. A key to the larvae of both species of Plagiogonus is presented along with life history data and the preferred food of these species. This study shows that A. arenarius and A. nanus feeding habits are closer to saprophagy than to coprophagy.

N2  - Diapausing larvae of Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) had relatively low supercooling points (SCP) ranging from –19.0 to –26.4°C. None of the specimens that froze at this temperature survived. A high survival rate (up to 87%) at –10°C for 10 days was observed in supercooled larvae. Such features are characteristic for insects that use a chill-tolerance strategy of cold hardiness. However, the cocoons formed by the diapausing larvae were penetrable by external ice crystals and the larvae showed a relatively high survival rate (23 – 34%) at –10°C for 10 days also in the frozen state caused by inoculation by external ice at high subzero temperatures. Such a duality with respect to cold hardiness strategies seems to be ecologically relevant to overwintering in soil habitats where there may be unpredictable contact with external ice.

N2  - Cicada orni L. is one of the most abundant and common species of cicada in Greece. However, this species was not found during recent field work on the Greek islands of Samos and Ikaria. Instead, the very closely related C. mordoganensis Boulard was found practically everywhere on these islands. C. orni and C. mordoganensis are very closely related species which are morphologically very similar (sibling species), even the male genitalia, and the acoustic signals produced by males during courtship and pair formation have the same general pattern. In order to describe the acoustic signals produced by these sibling species, temporal and spectral analyses were made of the calling songs of the males and certain acoustic variables were measured. Based on the duration of echemes, the number of pulse units they contain, the intervals between echemes and the number of echemes per second, the song of C. mordoganensis is distinct from that of C. orni. Cluster analysis of the acoustic characteristics of C. mordoganensis from Samos and Ikaria and of C. orni from the Greek mainland (Dionysos, north of Athens) gave a clear and distinct separation of these species. Moreover, as there has been very little divergence between these two species at the protein electrophoretic level, the acoustic divergence has evolved independently of allozyme divergence. This may imply that in these cicadas acoustic divergence, and therefore premating isolation, may have evolved rapidly and resulted in rapid speciation at low levels of general genetic differentiation.

N2  - Certain alkanes or their mixture present on the surface of ladybird elytra is important in the recognition of potential mates. Similar chemicals are present in the tracks of larvae, which deter conspecific female ladybirds from laying eggs in aphid colonies already being attacked by larvae. Finally, the shell of ladybird eggs is covered with alkanes that deter other species of ladybirds from eating the eggs. In each case the alkanes are similar although they fulfil different functions. There are, therefore, indications that ladybirds exploit their natural product with parsimonious versatility.

N2  - Although there are few studies of the sexual life of coccinellids these phenomena have attracted the interest of isolated groups of coccinellidologists. Probably the most important finding is that at least some coccinellid species (Adalia bipunctata and Harmonia axyridis) do not mate at random with the females prefering certain males. This phenomenon was first observed in Adalia bipunctata by Lusis and then studied in detail by Majerus, O’Donald, de Jong and others. In Japan, Harmonia axyridis was similarly studied by Osawa and Ueno. While the former author found that in this species (as in A. bipunctata) the colour of the elytra is most important in mate choice by females, the latter stresses that size and activity are important. Sperm competition is another interesting phenomenon, most often the sperm of the last male fertilizes the eggs (Ueno, Katakura). Obata and Hidaka have contributed in an important way to elucidating the function of the spermatophore in mating. The studies by Hodek and Ceryngier recorded the maturation and regression of testicular follicles and the relation of mating activity to diapause in four coccinellid species. In contrast to females, where induction of diapause prevents maturation of ovaries, in diapausing males the tissue of testicular follicles remains active until the temperatures decrease in late autumn. Dissection of spermathecae revealed principal difference in autumn mating activity between Coccinella septempunctata, in which 40–60% of the beetles mated before hibernation and Ceratomegilla (syn. Semiadalia) undecimnotata, which does not mate in autumn.

N2  - A range of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques, 1H liquid spectroscopy and T1 and T2 relaxation measurements, and microimaging, have been used to observe changes taking place within the bodies of live samples of Coccinella septempunctata, under a variety of conditions. NMR measurements showed that various organs could be seen and identified. It also showed that by changing the diet of the ladybird from aphids [Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)] to a standard artificial diet, major changes took place in the insects’ tissues. By using a combination of all three techniques it was concluded that on changing the diet of C. septempunctata a mass of nutrient was built up within the insect's abdomen possibly in the same manner as happens before diapause. Changes in the response to NMR measurements were also seen after infection of C. septempunctata by the parasitoid wasp (Dinocampus coccinellae). Most significantly an image of the parasitoid larva could be seen within the body mass of the ladybird. It was concluded that NMR could become a major tool in the non-destructive study of insects not just as a means of studying anatomy but also to observe changes in the nature of body tissue.

N2  - We determined if mature ladybirds use colour to initially find suitable host plants. We also determined whether ladybird beetles are capable of associating characteristics such as colour with the presence of prey. Here, we show that the multicoloured Asian ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis, has a differential response to yellow compared to green colours. Naive ladybirds, of both sexes, make significantly more visits and spend more time on yellow vs. green coloured pillars. After pairing yellow and green colours with the presence or absence of aphid prey, ladybirds alter their foraging behaviour. Beetles conditioned to having food on both pillar colours exhibited the same responses as naive beetles, while beetles conditioned to only yellow or green pillars did not exhibit a preference for visiting or spending time on different colours. However, there was a trend towards females spending more time on pillar colours on which they received reinforcement, and males spending more time foraging on colours opposite to that which they were reinforced. Thus, H. axyridis is capable of responding to cues such as colour, and its foraging behaviour can be altered as a result of prior experience.

Overwintering individuals of this species, and of native ladybirds, were collected from early season alfalfa in northern Utah during the period of initial establishment of the invader (1989 to 1999), and were measured for body size. Adult body size can vary widely within insect species, often reflecting differential success of individuals as immatures in obtaining food. Here I examine patterns of ladybird body size to address two questions associated with the establishment of C. septempunctata: (1) is there evidence for adverse impact on native species?, and (2) why has the invader has been so successful in establishment? As an indirect test of adverse competitive effect of the invader on native species, I determined whether mean body size of adults of the five most common native species (Coccinella tranversoguttata, Hippodamia convergens, H. quinquesignata, H. sinuata, and H. tredecimpunctata) declined over the period 1991–1997 as the invader increased rapidly in abundance. No such decline was observed for any of these species, thus providing no evidence that the invader’s establishment has significantly increased scramble competition for food among immature ladybirds. I also compared body size distribution of the invading species with that of native species. The invader was distinctive in having particularly large variation in body size among individuals (i.e., in having relatively high proportions of both unusually large and small individuals). Such results are consistent with the hypothesis that the invader’s success derives from being a generalist with much "ecological flexibility” in regard to the conditions under which it engages and succeeds in reproduction.

N2  - Pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) have been reported to produce winged offspring in the presence of predatory ladybirds. These offspring may leave host plants by flight after they have developed into winged adults. The inter-generational nature of this response raises the question about the chances of survival of aphids developing in attacked colonies. We studied the behaviour of predatory ladybirds on host plants by releasing adult 7-spot ladybirds (Coccinella septempunctata) on bean plants hosting either no prey individuals or colonies of 10 or 30 pea aphids. Interactions between predator and prey were recorded until the ladybird left the plant. Ladybird patch residence time increased with the number of aphids present on a plant but beetles generally left a plant before all aphids were eaten. The time budget of the ladybirds revealed a high proportion of time not spent in feeding activities. Predation rate was about one aphid killed per 10min residence time in both treatments with aphid-infested plants. Aphids that survived an attack by the predator or that were alarmed when a conspecific was attacked often emigrated from the host plant, and their number was of the same magnitude as the number of aphids killed by the predator. On average, pea aphid numbers at the end of an experiment were reduced to less than a third of the initial value. The results of the experiment show that attack by single ladybirds does on average not cause immediate extinction of small aphid colonies. The short patch residence times of on average less than two hours show that a predator individual that induces winged-offspring production in an aphid colony will not any longer be present in the colony when the induced offspring mature. To understand the adaptiveness of predator-induced wing development in pea aphids the probabilities of subsequent attacks on an aphid colony need to be investigated.

N2  - The aim of this work was to determine the impact of allelochemicals (glucosinolates/isothiocyanates) from Brassicaceae (Brassica napus and Sinapis alba) at two trophic levels in relation to biological control efficacy. The impact of these plants on aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) and ladybird Adalia bipunctata (L.) biology can be assessed by observation of several developmental parameters: mortality, development duration and adult weight. Sub-lethal toxicity can also be measured through the reproductive parameters of fecundity and/or egg viability. While both specialist and generalist aphids were positively influenced by Brassicaceae species, mixed effects are recorded in ladybird performances following the aphid species/host plant combinations. Significant differences appeared according to aphid host plant and aphid species. This work enhanced the influence of Brassicaceae plants either as cultivated species (B. napus) or as set-aside (S. alba) on both pests and beneficial insects. The allelochemical presence in plants must be taken into account in programs of integrated pest management due to their direct influence on biological control agents.

N2  - Dispersal of the sevenspotted lady beetle, Coccinella septempunctata, was measured in a series of mark-release-recapture experiments in Utah alfalfa. In three experiments, samples were taken in a radial pattern around the release point. Released beetles for the most part left the 0.36 ha (68 m diameter) sample area within 24 hours, and their average residence time in the sample area was calculated as 12, 6 and 1.6 h in the three experiments, respectively. The spatial distribution of beetles around the point of release could be described with normal distributions whose variance increased linearly in time with 3.8, 1.1 and 0.34 m2 per hour. In three additional field experiments the departure of marked beetles was compared between sugar-sprayed plots and control plots. Residence time was 20–30% longer in sugar-sprayed plots than in control plots, with mean residences of 5.3, 3.6, and 2.9 h in the sugar-sprayed plots in the three experiments, respectively, and means of 4.4, 2.7, and 2.4 h in the control plots. The density of unmarked beetles rose by a factor of 10–20 in the sugar sprayed plots during the first 4 to 6 hours following early morning spraying of sugar. This rapid and substantial increase in density cannot be explained by the slightly longer residence time in sugar-sprayed plots. We hypothesize that the aggregation in sugar-sprayed plots is mostly due to greatly increased immigration into those plots, in response to volatiles produced by the plant-pest-predator assembly.

N2  - Development and survival of larvae of two predatory ladybird species, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) and Coccinella septempunctata L. on hibiscus (Hibiscus syridis L.) trees was followed daily outdoors during four seasons. Data were analysed and stage-specific mortality in a stage-structured model was estimated using Manly’s (1997) method. Subsequently, key factor analysis was used to determine the life stages in which the daily mortality was best correlated with the total mortality during larval life. Consistently with the results from the first two years, the larvae suffered the greatest mortality during the first and fourth instars. The k-values for these two instars were also best correlated with those for the whole larval life, especially in H. axyridis.

N2  - The effects of imidacloprid on 1-day-old third instars of Harmonia axyridis were assessed by topical treatment and contact with treated glass plates in laboratory bioassays. When 5 µl of imidacloprid solutions were applied topically, the LD50 was 0.085 g/l per insect after 24 h. Contact with imidacloprid-treated plates had little effect on the number of third instars that became adults. Average duration of larval development was not significantly affected by duration of contact and imidacloprid concentrations. There were no significant differences in maximal larval weight, weight gain and day at maximum larval weight. There were significant differences in average weight gain per day (from third instar to prepupa) after treatments with different imidacloprid concentrations. A temporary knockdown effect was observed with higher concentrations and longer durations of contact with treated plates. Compared with untreated third instars, contact with imidacloprid-treated plates caused an increase in time spent (in seconds) on the glass plates resulting from an increase in number of stops (per second) and angular speed (degrees per second) and a decrease in linear speed, excluding stops (mm/second). The changes in locomotory behavior (i.e., duration of stay on untreated plate, number of stops and angular speed) lasted up to 24 h after contact with imidacloprid-treated plates.

N2  - The capacity of the green lacewing Chrysoperla rufilabris (Burmeister) to modify its oviposition strategy in response to extraguild prey availability in an oviposition site was studied. Gravid females were placed in presence and absence of aphids. Fecundity, fertility, dispersion and hatching synchrony were compared. Results indicate a statistical difference in the hatching synchrony of eggs. However, no statistical differences were observed in the proportion of infertile eggs and in egg dispersion. We suggest that C. rufilabris can alter hatching synchrony of eggs in condition of food scarcity in order to favour intra-clutch egg cannibalism by newly hatched larvae and thus increase its overall reproductive success.

N2  - The gallmidge Aphidoletes aphidimyza is used commercially to control aphids infesting greenhouse crops such as sweet pepper and tomato. In this study we investigated several different ways of improving its use as a biocontrol agent. In the laboratory there was a very strong relation between the availability of spider’s webs and successful mating. When mated in cages containing spider’s webs a greater proportion of the females were mated and the females laid more eggs compared to the females in cages without spider’s webs. As adults emerging from cocoons can crawl up through 15 cm of vermiculite it is possible to transport and release them from bottles, which can be placed open in a greenhouse instead of having to spread the material around the plants. Dispersal of adults from the bottles was measured by placing sentinel plants around a single release point. Eggs of the gallmidge were found on plants at distances up to 45 m from the release point. Intraguild predation of the eggs of the gallmidge by the mites Amblyseius degenerans and Amblyseius cucumeris was also assessed.

N2  - In 1995–1997, we studied the factors which may influence the ground "activity density” of Carabidae using pitfall traps placed in winter wheat, winter rape and pea stands (1995 only) grown within a 1 km2 area with uniform physical conditions. The traps were placed in plots of bare ground established within the crops and under surrounding intact plant stands. The communities were similar between crops within years (Pearson’s correlation coefficient r = 0.60 – 0.81), and between years within crops (r = 0.89 – 0.91), except for the poor winter rape stand in 1997. Factors influencing carabid "activity density” were: (i) Density of crop stand. The carabids preferred crop-shaded ground as long as crop density was low or medium but moved to bare ground plots when crop density became high. Under moderate crop density the preference differed between beetle species, most of which preferred crop-shaded ground while a few ones preferred bare ground. Carabid preferences were probably determined by microclimatic differences caused by presence and density of crop cover. (ii) Presence of seeds dropped on the ground. In rape stands, presence of crop and weed seeds increased the "activity density” of seed predators (species of genera Amara, Harpalus, Ophonus and Pseudoophonus). Scattering of rape seeds significantly increased local activity density of Harpalus affinis and H. distinguendus in the wheat stand. (iii) Presence of aphids. Activity density of Bembidion lampros and Trechus quadristriatus and between–year variation in pooled abundance of the five species recognised as aphid predators was associated with variation in aphid abundance.

N2  - The potential of the parasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi for controlling cereal aphids was tested in 16 m2 field cage experiments in 1998 and 1999. In the first year, aphids and parasitoids were released in cages containing naturally occurring populations of aphids and their natural enemies. In the second year, aphids and parasitoids were released in cages which had been cleared of insects by applying insecticide. The growths of the aphid populations in the different cages were analysed and compared. In 1998, the release of 50 pairs of parasitoids per cage had no significant effect on aphid population growth relative to that in the control cages. Even though the aphid population growth rates were less than 60% of that in the control cages, in the cages in which 100 pairs and 200 pairs of parasitoids were released, it was not possible to show they statistically differed. The aphid populations in these three cages were held below 10 aphids per tiller. In 1999, the aphid density was higher and the population grew faster than in 1998. The release of 100 and 200 parasitoids per cage significantly reduced aphid population growth. A. rhopalosiphi seemed to be a good control agent in field cages, provided they were released at the beginning of aphid population growth.

N2  - Aphelinus abdominalis Dalman (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), a solitary endoparasitoid of cereal aphids [e.g. Sitobion avenae (F.)] and aphids in greenhouses [e.g. Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas)] is available as biological control agent against aphid pests in greenhouses. As little is yet known about its long-range host location after release, the in-flight orientation of female A. abdominalis was investigated with regard to the effects of post-emergence experience, using a wind tunnel bioassay. In no-choice tests experienced females responded to the odour of M. euphorbiae-infested sweet pepper and aubergine plants while naive females exhibited mostly random flights. In a choice test, offering infested and uninfested plants of the same species, experienced wasps were able to recognize the plant-host complex (PHC) and selected it as landing site. In contrast to uninfested plants, host-damaged plants (infested plants with aphids removed) attracted experienced females just as well as infested plants. When the responses of groups of parasitoids with experience on two different plant-host complexes were studied, specifically trained wasps were observed to orientate significantly better towards the infested target plant than wasps with previous experience on the non-target plant. A final choice test, with an infested pepper and an infested aubergine plant as odour sources, showed that females trained on one of the offered plant-host combinations significantly preferred the odour of the learnt PHC to that of the different PHC. The results suggest that A. abdominalis females employ specific volatile signals emitted by host-infested plants (synomones) during long-range host location. These odours must be learnt, e.g. in association with a successful oviposition.

N2  - The tritrophic interactions between two different plant-host complexes, Avena sativa-Sitobion avenae, Triticum aestivum-S. avenae and the aphid parasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi were studied with respect to odour learning and recognition by the parasitoid. The orientation behaviour of females towards odours from either uninfested or aphid-infested oat or wheat plants was tested in a series of dual choice Y-tube olfactometer experiments. Female parasitoids had the opportunity to gain a single oviposition experience on either the oat-S. avenae or wheat-S. avenae complex before the experiment. In the first set of experiments, where A. rhopalosiphi was reared on the oat-S. avenae complex, eight odour-bait combinations were tested. The females did not discriminate between uninfested oat and wheat. After oat complex experience, females responded to odours from the oat complex, but not to odours from the wheat complex. Consequently, in a direct comparison the oat complex was preferred over the wheat complex. After wheat complex experience, the parasitoid’s orientation responses gave a different picture. Both, the wheat complex and the oat complex, were then shown to be equally attractive. Hence, in direct comparison no preference was recorded between the oat and wheat complexes. In a second set of experiments, where A. rhopalosiphi was reared on the wheat- S. avenae complex, a possible influence of any pre-adult or emergence-related host plant experience could be excluded as the same results were obtained as before. At first glance the responses towards the different odour baits seem inconsistent. However, the results may be explained using a simple model with two key odour components.

N2  - The foraging behaviour of individual females of Aphidius uzbekistanicus Luzhetski (Hymenoptera: Aphidiidae) on oat plants with one colony of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae F. (Homoptera: Aphididae) was examined in laboratory experiments. Patch time allocation was analysed under semi-natural conditions when individual hyperparasitoid females, Alloxysta victrix Westwood (Hymenoptera: Alloxystidae) or their volatiles 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one or a mixture of iridoid substances soaked on vermiculite dummies were present simultaneously. Patch residence times of foraging primary parasitoid females were significantly reduced in all analysed treatment groups. Attack numbers on aphids and resulting aphid mummies were also significantly reduced. The presence of hyperparasitoids or their volatiles had no influence on the proportion of time spent engaged in different behaviour by the primary parasitoid. After encounters with hyperparasitoid females or vermiculite dispensers, which had been soaked with the synthetical iridoids, A.uzbekistanicus females changed their behaviour more frequently, and they left the aphid colony at a higher rate than in the controls, where dispensers had been soaked with only pure pentane. The identification of the associated iridoid substances, produced in the hyperparasitoid mandibular glands, is briefly described and their biological significance is discussed.

Gravid females of H. axyridis were deterred from ovipositing on plants contaminated with conspecific larval tracks, but not on those with heterospecific tracks. H. axyridis females spent significantly less time on plants contaminated with conspecific ODP than on those with heterospecific ODP.

N2  - Adalia bipunctata is a well-known predaceous ladybird distributed in Europe, Central Asia and North America. This species has not been recorded in Japan. Recently, we found this species in the Osaka Bay area in central Japan, and assume that it was imported with goods such as timber by ships. We studied the life history and the distribution in the Osaka Bay area since the initial discovery. The larvae and adults preyed on aphids (mainly, Periphyllus viridis) on trees such as Acer buergerianum and Rhaphiolepis umbellata. The over-wintered adults appeared in March and laid eggs. The adults emerged in spring, and were in the rolled leaves throughout the rest of the year. Thus, in Japan this ladybird is univoltine with long inactivity in adult. The life history of Japanese population of A. bipunctata differs considerably from other areas where populations are multivoltine. The developmental threshold was estimated to be 6.3°C and the sum of effective temperatures was 322.6 day-degrees for the period from egg to adult emergence. Predation on prepupae of A. bipunctata by the larvae of native species such as Harmonia axyridis was observed occasionally.

N2  - Coccinella septempunctata was approximately 20% more reluctant to eat the eggs of Adalia bipunctata than the reverse. In addition, fourth instar larvae of C. septempunctata failed to complete their development on a diet of A. bipunctata eggs and only 30% of those of A. bipunctata completed their development on a diet of C. septempunctata eggs, and the survivors took nearly 2 times as long as those fed aphids. This is an indication that the costs of intraguild predation might outweigh the benefits.

N2  - We asked if the structural heterogeneity of a laboratory arena differentially affected the abandonment of the plot, residence time, locomotory rate, pause duration and turning rate of adult Eriopis connexa and Hippodamia variegata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We simulated an increase in heterogeneity by distributing vertically-oriented toothpicks in a circular arena: one control (without toothpicks), one uniform plot (toothpicks every 1 cm) and one random plot (randomly distributed toothpicks). No food was provided inside the arena. Coccinellids were released individually in the centre of each plot and their movement was videotaped. Fewer H. variegata adults left the plots as these become more heterogeneous. E. connexa did not discriminate between plots in their residence time, but H. variegata remained longer in the uniform and longest in the random plots. H. variegata only stayed longer than E. connexa in the random plots. This resulted because adults of H. variegata were stationary for longer periods, moved more slowly and less linearly and explored a higher number of toothpicks than adults of E. connexa in more heterogeneous environments. Thus, the physical structure of the environment differentially affects the movement patterns of insects. Eriopis connexa seems to be less sensitive to structural heterogeneity than H. variegata.

N2  - Some features of the biology and feeding relationships of small waterbugs (Notonectidae, Corixidae, Pleidae, Helotrephidae, Aphelocheiridae) and ripicolous bugs (Gelastocoridae, Ochteridae) are reviewed. Individual families are discussed as predators or as prey of other animals. Special attention is given to characteristics and relationships that affect human beings directly or indirectly. The most important relationships from the economic point of view are: bugs and blood-sucking Diptera, bugs and fish, bugs and some endangered or protected amphibians and water birds. Of less importance is the occasional use of some aquatic bugs as saprobity bioindicators. It seems that the economic importance of these bugs has been underestimated.

N2  - A study on the effect of heat stress on the activity of the medial A1 and A2 neurosecretory neurons (NSN), and the activity of midgut a-amylase and protease was performed on the fifth larval instar of Morimus funereus. Exposure of the larvae to 35°C led to a decrease in the activity of both A1 and A2 NSN, the former being more marked than the latter. These neurons responded differently to heat stress in terms of neurosecretory material synthesis and release. The changes in the size of both A1 NSN and their nuclei and protease activity in the larvae exposed to elevated temperature were significantly correlated, which suggests that A1 NSN play a role in the regulation of the activity of this enzyme during heat stress. The significant correlations between the size of A2 NSN and protease activity in the controls, and the size of both A2 NSN and their nuclei and amylase activity in larvae exposed to heat stress, similarly may mean that A2 NSN regulate both digestive enzyme activities depending on environmental temperature.

N2  - The long-winged (macropterous) and short-winged (brachypterous) adult males of Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.) from temperate (Czech Republic) and Mediterranean (Israel) populations were analysed for the sexual activity and the functional activity of their accessory glands. The sexual activity of the males reared either under long-day (18L : 6D) or short-day (12L : 12D) conditions was determined by their capability to mate with 5-day-old reproductive females of the brachypterous morph and to fertilize the eggs. The functional activity of accessory glands was characterized by the presence of a specific immuno-marker. Sexual activity of fasting macropterous males from both temperate and Mediterranean populations was almost as high as that observed in the reproductive brachypterous ones. These findings were also confirmed by an immunotest. Contrary to the temperate macropterous males, the feeding arrest in temperate macropterous females was coupled with a non-diapause inhibition of reproduction in spite of long days. A similar kind of difference was observed also in the Mediterranean macropterous bugs reared under short-day conditions. The results showed the sexual difference in reproductive activity of the macropterous morph in P. apterus.

N2  - Wolbachia pipientis (Hertig) (Rickettsiaceae) is an endocellular bacterium infecting numerous species of arthropods. The bacterium is harboured by males and females but is only transmitted maternally because spermatocytes shed their Wolbachia during maturation. The presence of this endosymbiont can lead to feminisation of the host, parthenogenesis, male-killing or reproductive incompatibility called cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). Although Wolbachia transmission is exclusively maternal, phylogenetic evidence indicates that very rare inter-species transmission events have taken place. Horizontal transmission is possible in the laboratory by transferring cytoplasm from infected to uninfected eggs. Using this technique, we have artificially infected lines of the fruit fly Drosophila simulans Sturtevant (Drosophilidae). Recipient lines came from two different D. simulans populations. One ("naive” host) is not infected in the wild. The other ("usual” host) is a population naturally carrying Wolbachia in the wild. In this second case, recipient flies used in the experiment came from a stock culture that had been cured off its infection beforehand by an antibiotic treatment. Infected D. simulans laboratory stocks were used as donors. We assessed the three following parameters: (i) trans-infection success rate (ratio of infected over total female zygote having survived the injection), (ii) level of cytoplasmic incompatibility expressed by trans-infected males three generations post-trans-infection, and (iii) infection loss rate over time in trans-infected lines (percentage of lines having lost the infection after 20 to 40 generations). We observed that parameter (i) did not differ significantly whether the recipient line came from a "naive” or a "usual” host population. However, both (ii) and (iii) were significantly higher in the "naive” trans-infected stock, which is in agreement with earlier theoretical considerations.

N2  - A combination of biological control and host-plant resistance is needed to control greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood). The high level of susceptibility of several host plants to whitefly, based on their performance on these plants, is well documented. These studies only provide information on the overall host-plant acceptance by whiteflies. Here, we use a method that allows an examination of the different tissue layers in the overall acceptance. The effects of plant tissue factors on whitefly probing profiles were monitored using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) method. The EPGs of whitefly originating from a culture on glasshouse cucumber, were recorded for 8 hours on sweet pepper, tomato, gerbera and cucumber plants produced in a glasshouse. On sweet pepper the graphs showed that whitefly made many short probes, had long xylem phases, short phloem phases, and the shortest duration of first probes. An opposite probing profile was found on cucumber: longer probes, shorter xylem phases, fewer phloem phases but of longer duration, and longer first probes. The values of these parameters for gerbera and tomato were intermediate. Whiteflies encountered the greatest stimulation or the least resistance in the tissues of cucumber, and the least stimulation or the greatest resistance in the tissues of sweet pepper. Rejection of host plants probably occurred before the phloem tissue was reached, as the probes prior to a whitefly leaving a host plant were so short that the stylets cannot have reached the phloem. But phloem factors also determine host-plant rejection, as phloem probing on sweet pepper - a poor host plant - was much shorter than on the other host plants. Resistance factors seem, therefore, to be located both in the epidermis/mesophyll and in the phloem. We hypothesize that the factors encountered by whitefly in the different tissue layers during probing contribute to the acceptance or rejection of a host plant. Based on the performance of whitefly on these plants, which is also reflected in the values of the EPG parameters, the order of acceptance ranked from high to low is cucumber > tomato = gerbera > sweet pepper.

N2  - The plant vigour hypothesis (PVH) predicts that females of galling insects preferentially oviposit on the most vigorous plants or plant modules, where their offspring’s performance is highest. In the years 1995 to 1998, we evaluated the responses of species of two different guilds, two chewing species, Pantomorus sp. and Naupactus lar (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and one galling species, Contarinia sp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), to the length of shoots that were assumed to show the vigour of the tropical shrub Bauhinia brevipes (Leguminosae). The abundance of the chewing herbivores was not influenced by shoot length, since attack rates were randomly distributed among shoot length classes. The abundance of Contarinia galls increased with increasing shoot length, as proposed by the PVH. However, when we related the attack rate to unit length of shoot (cm), which denotes the resource availability per unit length, there was no effect of shoot length on Contarinia sp. These data corroborate the idea of a continuum of responses to plant quality, even when different herbivores feed on the same host plant.

N2  - Hyssopus pallidus (Askew) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is a gregarious ectoparasitoid of late larvae of the codling moth, Cydia pomonella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). In the present work reproduction and the development and morphology of the immature stages were studied. Five larval instars were differentiated by the shape and size of the mandibles. The larvae are hymenopteriform with a weakly sclerotized head and 13 segments. The first instar has four pairs of spiracles, while the other four instars have nine pairs. Under laboratory conditions of 22–24°C and 60–80% RH the egg stage lasted 1.5 days, the larval instars 6.3 days, and the pupal stage 7.9 days in females and 7.2 days in males. The duration of each of the five larval instars (L1-L5) is approximately 1, 0.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 3.5 days, respectively. Male and female development time does not differ significantly in the egg and larval stages, but differences are highly significant in the pupal stage. Male and female pupae can be differentiated by their sexual rudiments. Copulation takes place immediately upon emergence of the females between siblings, adult males appearing before the females. Females in culture with access to an energy source can survive for more than 60 days. They are synovigenic: they emerge with no mature eggs in their ovaries and take the first two days after emergence to mature the full set of around 24–30 eggs. They continue paralyzing hosts, ovipositing and maturing eggs for as long as they live. After an oviposition a female needs two to three days to mature a new full set of eggs. Age and feeding influence egg load. Oösorption is significant in starved females, but also occurs in older fed females with no host contact.

N2  - Telenomus busseolae Gahan (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) is an egg parasitoid, which is under evaluation for possible introduction into Italy as a biological control agent of the Corn Stalk Borer, Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Two strains are being considered, one from Africa and the other from Turkey. In a series of laboratory experiments we compared their reproductive capacities, walking behaviour, and host selection behaviour mediated by the sex pheromone and body scales of the host. As reciprocal crosses between the two strains yielded female offspring, they are not reproductively isolated. The two strains were similar in both their reproductive capacity and female longevity. Females of both produced 75–90 eggs and lived on average for 6–7 days. There were differences between the two strains in walking behaviour, searching pattern and in the host location behaviour. The African strain walked faster then the Turkish strain, and showed a slower angular speed and lower turning rate. The African strain showed a significant increase in its speed of movement in response to the host's sex pheromone and a more intense local search after encountering host body scales. These results on intraspecific variability could help choosing an appropriate strain of T. busseolae for corn borer management in Italy.

N2  - The eight spined larch bark beetles infest various species of Larix in Europe and Asia. Ips cembrae is the only Ips species with larch as its main host. Ips subelongatus, Ips fallax, Ips shinanonensis and Ips cembrae var. engadinensis are treated as synonyms of I. cembrae. These three putative species and the one variety are distinguished by their host tree and geographic distribution, as it is not possible to distinguish them on the basis of morphological differences. Beetles were collected from European and Asian populations, and from hosts and geographic areas where the species were first found and described and in their natural ranges of distribution. These beetles were used to study the phylogenetic relationships of the eight spined larch bark beetles. A region of the mitochondrial gene was analysed and the blue-stain fungi associated with I. cembrae in Europe were investigated and compared with those recorded as associated with the larch bark beetle in Japan. Only minor sequence differences were detected between the populations in Europe and Asia. However, the European populations differed by 4.3% from the Asian populations. The phylogenetic analysis placed the European and Asian haplotypes in significantly distinct clusters. This distinction was supported by the finding of an insertion/deletion in a non-coding region of the mitochondrial DNA. Furthermore, there are differences in the fungi associated with the eight spined larch bark beetles in Europe and Japan. The results suggest that the I. cembrae complex contains at least two taxa: I. cembrae infesting larch in Europe and I. subelongatus infesting larch in Asia.

N2  - Sympecma fusca and Coenagrion caerulescens mainly deposit their eggs into floating dead parts of emergent plants. In their initial choice of oviposition site (selection of landing site) S. fusca does not distinguish between fresh and dead plant material, whereas C. caerulescens significantly prefers dead material. In S. fusca, the missing discrimination of the plant condition in the choice of the landing site is explained by its oviposition period in the beginning of the vegetation period when the green plant material is rare. C. caerulescens reproduces in summer and finds dead and living plants side by side. I suggest that in the latter species an early recognition of dead material is advantageous because of the reduction of the expense in searching.

N2  - I review the effects of habitat fragmentation on carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) and examine whether the taxon could be used as an indicator of fragmentation. Related to this, I study the conservation needs of carabids. The reviewed studies showed that habitat fragmentation affects carabid assemblages. Many species that require habitat types found in interiors of fragments are threatened by fragmentation. On the other hand, the species composition of small fragments of habitat (up to a few hectares) is often altered by species invading from the surroundings. Recommendations for mitigating these adverse effects include maintenance of large habitat patches and connections between them. Furthermore, landscape homogenisation should be avoided by maintaining heterogeneity of habitat types. It appears that at least in the Northern Hemisphere there is enough data about carabids for them to be fruitfully used to signal changes in land use practices. Many carabid species have been classified as threatened. Maintenance of the red-listed carabids in the landscape requires species-specific or assemblage-specific measures.

N2  - Phylogenetic systematics comprise the principles and methods by which we reconstruct the evolutionary history (phylogeny) of organisms and transform this reconstruction into a biological classification of these organisms. The most important progress in designing the tools for phylogenetic reconstruction was initiated by the German entomologist Willi Hennig (1913–1976), who clarified or redefined the goals of phylogenetic systematics in a book published in 1950: Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik. An extensively revised, English translation was published in 1966: Phylogenetic Systematics. W. Hennig’s "phylogenetic systematics” undoubtedly was a very significant contribution to systematics, by some systematists and philosophers even characterized as a "revolution”. Hennig’s redefinition and clarification of the concepts of monophyly and phylogenetic relationships created a sound foundation for systematics in general. After decades of focussing on species-level problems, Hennig redirected the interest of systematists towards the study of higher taxa and the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships between them. A phylogenetic system is now almost universally accepted as the most useful general reference system for biology. It has been able to accommodate new developments in systematics (such as quantitative cladistics and molecular systematics), evolutionary biology (such as ecological phylogenetics), and historical biogeography.

N2  - So far, available cytogenetic data on 24 species of Rhopalidae reveal a male diploid chromosome number of 13, with a pair of m chromosomes and an X0/XX (male/female) sex chromosome determining system. As a rule Heteroptera have holokinetic chromosomes and a pre-reductional type of meiosis: the autosomal bivalents and the m pseudobivalent segregate reductionally at first meiotic division, while the X chromosome segregates equationally. In the present study, the meiotic chromosome behaviour was analyzed in males from different Argentinean populations of Jadera haematoloma and J. sanguinolenta. Our results corroborate the diploid chromosome number and general patterns of male meiosis previously reported by other authors in samples from Brazil and Texas (USA). Among bivalents, one is remarkably larger and may present one or two terminal chiasmata. Comparison of mean chiasma frequency between Jadera haematoloma (5.63) and J. sanguinolenta (5.14) revealed that differences are significant. In most individuals of both species the largest pair appears as univalents in a variable number of cells and shows a regular meiotic segregation. Autosomal univalents orientate axially at metaphase I (with their long axis parallel to the spindle axis) and segregate equationally at anaphase I. At metaphase II they associate end-to-end forming a pseudobivalent that segregates reductionally at anaphase II. An hypothesis is suggested to explain the appearance of the largest pair, either as a ring/rod bivalent or as univalents within the same individual, although an asynaptic or desynaptic origin of the univalents cannot be ascertained. The highly regular meiotic behaviour of this autosomal pair could ensure a high fertility of the individuals, and could be considered a selectively neutral condition or, at least, not detrimental.

N2  - Polyclonal antibodies against PBAN were used to map the distribution of PBAN-like antigenic sites in the brain-suboesophageal ganglion (Br-SOG) complex, associated neurohaemal structures, ventral nerve cord ganglia and in the alimentary canal. A pair of lateral neurosecretory cells immunopositive to the antiserum were found in each half of the deutocerebrum. PBAN-like immunoreactivity (PLI) was also noticed in the tritocerebral region of the brain and in the aorta. Two groups of immunopositive cells of four and two cells respectively, were found in the SOG. Small and weakly immunoreactive neurons were identified in the prothoracic ganglion, whereas in the pterothoracic ganglion a pair of cells reacted positively to the antibody. Immunoreactive cells were also identified in the corpora cardiaca. Some of the epithelial endocrine cells of the midgut also showed immunoreactivity to PBAN antiserum.

N2  - The aim of this study was to determine if there is a latitudinal gradient in the photoperiodic regulation of wing dimorphism in the flightless bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.). For this purpose individuals from three geographical populations (Israel, Spain and Czech Republic) were reared under different photoperiods and the wing length of the adults analyzed. The highest percentage of long-winged (macropterous) specimens was found in the population from Israel (35.3%), whereas percentages of macroptery were lower in the cultures from Spain (9.5%) and Czech Republic (8.6%). A higher proportion of macropterous specimens was recorded in the northern population of P. apterus kept under long daylengths (Czech Republic, 16 h) than in the southern populations (Spain, 14–15 h; Israel, 12 h). The results indicate that there is a latitudinal gradient in the critical photoperiod determining wing length in P. apterus.

N2  - Only in the southern part of the Iberian Peninsula the large white butterfly Pieris brassicae was recorded to pass the summer in pupal aestivation, induced by long-day photoperiods. It is not clear why this photoperiodic response is regionally restricted. We investigated whether the change of life history in P. brassicae may affect the infestation by parasites. This was done by testing the coincidence of photoperiodic responses in both the host P. brassicae and in its main parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. While the response under short-day conditions was very similar in both species, no summer dormancy of any type was found in the parasitoid at photophases ³ 15h and temperatures of 15°–25°C in contrast to 100% aestivation in the host. We suggest that aestivation is a response which allows the host to desynchronise its life cycle from that of its parasitoid. This is effective because parasitoid wasps cannot pass the temporary absence of suitable host stages by a similar developmental rest. C. glomerata is then forced to switch to less adequate host species which diminishes its reproductive success.

N2  - This study investigates the thermal requirements, nymphal development rates and the fecundity of both alate and apterous adults of the giant willow aphid, Tuberolachnus salignus (Gmelin) at several temperatures. Nymphal development rate increased linearly with temperature. It was estimated that 196 ± 4 degree-days above a threshold temperature of 5.5 ± 0.3°C were required for apterae to complete development from birth to final ecdysis. The alate morph was significantly less fecund than the apterous morph and its fecundity did not vary with temperature. The apterous morph displayed highest fecundity at 20°C. Survival to reproduction was lower in the alate morph, but temperature had no effect on the proportion reproducing in either morph.

N2  - The effects of oviposition-deterring larval tracks of four aphidophagous coccinellids and two chrysopids were investigated on females of four coccinellid species in choice tests. Aphidophagous coccinellids Cycloneda limbifer Casey, Semiadalia undecimnotata (Schneider) and Coccinella septempunctata L. laid significantly fewer eggs on sites with tracks of unfed conspecific first instar larvae than on clean sites, but Leis dimidiata (F.) laid similar numbers of eggs on both sites. In some but not all species, tracks of heterospecific predators also deterred coccinellid females. Interspecific effects were stronger between some allopatric species than between the sympatric coccinellids C. septempunctata and S. undecimnotata. C. limbifer laid relatively few eggs on sites previously exposed to larvae of S. undecimnotata and L. dimidiata. S. undecimnotata avoided sites with tracks of L. dimidiata larvae. The two smaller species, C. limbifer and S. undecimnotata, laid considerably fewer eggs per batch than the larger coccinellids, C. septempunctata and L. dimidiata. C. limbifer and S. undecimnotata oviposited similar numbers of eggs on clean sites and sites with tracks of chrysopid larvae of the species Chrysopa oculata and Chrysopa perla. Females of C. septempunctata laid fewer eggs on sites previously exposed to larvae of C. oculata but not C. perla.Densities of faecal spots of coccinellid females on clean substrates and substrates with tracks of predatory larvae differed significantly in only one choice test (C. limbifer females exposed to tracks of S. undecimnotata larvae). This indicates that the presence of larval tracks affects where females lay eggs more than where they search.

N2  - As part of a search for natural enemies of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), virus-infected samples were collected near Toulouse, France. Light and electron microscope studies confirmed that the French strain is a multinucleocapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus (MNPV). In vivo bioassays using the New Jersey strain of L. dispar, and comparing L. dispar MNPV (LdMNPV) strains from France, North America and Korea, showed that the French strain was the least active, whereas the North American strain had the highest activity. The viral efficacy of all strains was enhanced 200 to 1300-fold in the presence of 1% fluorescent brightener. The enhancement was highest in the American strain and lowest in the French strain. French LdMNPV (LdMNPVF) DNA cut with four restriction enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI, HindIII, and NotI) revealed minor fragment size differences, but many similarities when compared to the North American and the Korean strain. PCR amplification of a LdMNPV early gene (G22) was detected in the North American and the Korean strain, but not in the French strain.

N2  - The female Geometridae are characterized by the presence of saccular pheromone glands. They are paired structures, invaginated anteriorly and located dorso-laterally to the rectum. The opening of dorsal saccular glands varies from wide to narrow and opens up on the 9th abdominal segment. These saccular glands are widely distributed in the family. Morphological variability of these glands can be observed. In certain species of Geometridae, the paired glands vary from short to long. Pheromone production is an established function of these glands, in the case of Rheumaptera hastata.

Unlike other members of the zygaenid subfamily Chalcosiinae, the last instar larva of A. infausta has numerous secondary setae and a multitude of cuticular cavities that are devoid of openings. The other chalcosiine genera have primary setae and cuticular cavities with specialized openings through which a defensive secretion can be discharged. Imaginal characters, on the other hand, provide strong evidence for placing Aglaope in the Chalcosiinae.

N2  - Selected representatives of Cucujoidea, Cleroidea, Tenebrionoidea, Chrysomelidae, and Lymexylidae were examined. External and internal head structures of larvae of Sphindus americanus and Ericmodes spp. are described in detail. The data were analyzed cladistically. A sister group relationship between Sphindidae and Protocucujidae is suggested by the vertical position of the labrum. The monophyly of Cucujiformia is supported by the reduced dorsal and anterior tentorial arms, fusion of galea and lacinia, and the presence of tube-like salivary glands. Absence of M. tentoriopraementalis inferior and presence of a short prepharyngeal tube are potential synapomorphies of Cleroidea, Cucujoidea and Tenebrionoidea. The monophyly of Cleroidea and Cucujoidea is suggested by the unusual attachment of the M. tentoriostipitalis to the ventral side of the posterior hypopharynx. Cucujoidea are paraphyletic. The families Endomychidae, Coccinellidae and Nitidulidae are more closely related to the monophyletic Cleroidea, than to other cucujoid groups. Separation of the posterior tentorial arms from the tentorial bridge and presence of a maxillolabial complex are synapomorphic features of Cleroidea and these cucujoid families. For a reliable reconstruction of cucujoid interrelationships, further characters and taxa need to be studied.

N2  - The activity and number of protocerebral neurosecretory neurons of the dorsolateral group (L1, L2 and L2’), as well as the size of the corpora allata were investigated in 5th instar larvae of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) from two populations (oak and locust-tree forests) fed one of two host-plants (oak is a suitable and locust-tree an unsuitable host-plant).The monitoring of activity related cytological parameters and the number of protocerebral dorsolateral neurosecretory neurons revealed that differently adapted populations respond to nutritive stress differently. The activity of the L1 neurosecretory neurons in the protocerebra of the caterpillars is low in those from the locust-tree forest regardless of host-plant quality. The L2 neurosecretory neurons in the oak population become active when they were fed the unsuitable host-plant whereas their activity was high in locust-tree caterpillars regardless of the host-plant. A decrease in the number of neurosecretory neurons in a response to a novel food was noticed in both populations. The activity of the L2’ neurosecretory neurons was similar in all caterpillars, but their number was increased in those from the locust-tree forest. The corpora allata of the locust-tree caterpillars were large whereas those of the oak forest caterpillars only increased in size when they were fed locust-tree leaves.It is obvious that nutritive stress results in neurosecretory reorganization and changes in the titre of hormones that modulate the morphogenetic programme.

N2  - The physiological parameters mortality, mass, oxygen consumption and amylase activity, and microanatomical features of the digestive tract, mesenchym and reproductive organs were used to characterise starvation in Galumna elimata. The mites were reared in sterilised plastic vials containing moistened zeolite at 25°C and a 12:12 photoperiod. The control group was kept under the same conditions, but pieces of bark covered with the green bark alga, Desmococcus vulgaris (syn. Protococcus viridis), were added as food for the mites. The physiological parameters were recorded after 21 days, and the microanatomical after 21 and 42 days. The guts of the starved mites were empty or filled with mucoid substances, while the guts of control mites contained food boli formed from algal cells. The mortality was significantly higher in starved animals. The mortality after 42 days of starvation was higher in males than females. The fresh mass of starved individuals significantly decreased while the water proportion content of their body tissues increased. Oxygen consumption of the starved mites was lower. Starvation did not influence the activity of amylase. Glycogeneous granulae were characteristically absent, and mucoid substances present in the guts of mites starved for 21 days. The activity of mesenteral and caecal cells, proventricular glands and cells of salivary glands was reduced after 42 days of starvation. The cells of the seminal vesicles were reduced and contained no spermatic cells in males starved for 42 days. Starved females probably resorbed immature oocytes, but had eggs in their oviducts. Starvation induces ovovivipary or larvipary in Galumna elimata.

N2  - The effect of larval body size of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera, Geometridae) on the risk of parasitism was studied in a field experiment. The experiment involved three pairwise exposures of different larval instars to parasitoids. Three hymenopteran species were responsible for most of the parasitism. Parasitism risk was found to be host-instar independent. This result was consistent across parasitoid species and experiments. The results suggest that host use by larval parasitoids cannot constrain selection for larger body size in E. autumnata. However, high mortality due to parasitism may select for a short developmental period (the slow-growth/high-mortality hypothesis), and smaller body sizes as a by-product. A strong selective effect of parasitism on the timing of larval development in E. autumnata is also unlikely. The larger was the host, the larger was the adult size of the parasitoid and the shorter its development time (for one species). We suggest that the lack of a preference-performance linkage in the system studied may be related to the time stress associated with the short phenological window of host vulnerability.

N2  - The coccinellid H. axyridis shows considerable intraspecific variability of elytral patterns. In this paper, we suggest that a genotype that confers a specific pattern of elytra could also confer other specific autecological attributes. The aim of this paper is to compare fitness parameters of two phenotypes (aulica and nigra). Aulica is a common morph characterized by two light red areas that nearly cover the whole elytra, leaving a narrow black border, whereas nigra is completely black; the latter is a rare morph that was naturally obtained from mass cultures. Intraspecific differences occur between H. axyridis phenotypes. The aulica phenotype is more voracious than nigra. Consumption rate of males is higher in aulica than in nigra, but there is no difference for females. Larval biomass of aulica is generally higher than that of nigra. The maximum body-weights reached by larval instars and adults are significantly higher for aulica. Aulica also has greater longevity and reproductive capacity. Only life stage duration of eggs and pre-pupae differ between the two phenotypes. Nigra shows lower fecundity and fertility. Our study showed that the strong differences in phenotype traits of the coccinellid H. axyridis could affect its fitness.

N2  - Density dependent host mortality in the interaction between the solitary endoparasitoid Aphidius colemani (Aphidiidae), and its host, the green peach aphid Myzus persicae, was examined on greenhouse peppers. The experimental approach attempted to eliminate spatial interdependence in the relationship between host density and host mortality by using different plants to measure parasitism at different spatial scales. Increasing host density at the plant scale caused a significant increase in the proportion of host mortality. However, at the shoot and leaf scale, increasing host density caused a significant decrease in host mortality. This may be one of the first experimental demonstrations of a switch from inverse to direct density dependence. The pattern is assumed to be a result of searching parasitoids using different cues at different spatial scales.

N2  - The distribution of arthropod species on a 400 m elevational gradient (equivalent to a temperature decrease of 2.5°C) on Snowdon, North Wales, was examined and compared with the British distribution. Preferred temperature, an indication of optimal body temperature (Tb), and supercooling point (SCP), an indication of cold tolerance, of several species on the gradient were determined experimentally. The alpine beetle species Patrobus assimilis and Nebria rufescens had low preferred Tb, of 5.6 and 7.1°C respectively, whereas the more widespread upland species had higher preferred Tb, between 12.9 and 15.5°C. The SCP of both alpine and widespread beetles were similar, being between –6.9 and –5.8°C. The alpine species, which were smaller, were freeze intolerant, whereas the widespread species, which were larger, were freeze tolerant. On the national scale there was significant correlation between preferred Tb and species elevation, but no correlation with SCP. It is concluded that the alpine species survive on Snowdon because their optimal Tb is close to the ambient temperature at the time of day and year when they are active and because they are able to tolerate winter temperatures, by a combination of cold tolerance and shelter. Although a species’ optimal niche will tend to shift upwards as mean temperatures rise with global climatic change, complex microclimatic and biotic factors make changes in distribution difficult to predict.

N2  - This report describes 7 new species of Drosophila found in the Eastern Arc mountains and on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania: D. baucipyga, D. gata, D. kilimanjarica, D. neogata, D. paragata, D. pilocornuta and D. usambarensis spp.n. Two new species complexes, the megapyga species complex (Sophophora subgenus, melanogaster group, montium subgroup) and the gata species complex (Drosophila subgenus) are introduced. Only one species, D. baucipyga of the montium subgroup, has a geographical range matching the whole Eastern Arc, from the Usambara Mts. in the north-east of Tanzania to Mt. Uzungwa in the south-south west of the country. Five others, including one representative of the dentissima group of the Sophophora subgenus, D. usambarensis, and four representatives of the Drosophila subgenus, D. gata, D. neogata, D. paragata and D. pilocornuta, were found only in the Usambara Mts. Two of these five, D. usambarensis and D. pilocornuta were found only in West-Usambara, while two other related species, D. gata and D. paragata, were found only in East-Usambara. Only the distribution of D. neogata covers the whole of the Usambara mountains. Outside the Eastern Arc, another representative of the dentissima group, D. kilimanjarica, was found only on Mount Kilimanjaro. This new, highly specific, montane fauna of Drosophila further contributes to the unique biological diversity of the Eastern Arc Mts. The biogeographic affinities of the new taxa suggest past connections with the Virunga and Ruwenzori ranges and further west with the Cameroon Volcanic Line. It indicates, in particular, that the Eastern Arc forests have passed through a succession of coalescence and fragmentation events.

N2  - Pulsations of dorsal vessel were monitored by the noninvasive techniques of contact thermography on the dorsal cuticle and by strain gauge detection of abdominal elongation movements. Diapausing pupae exhibited periods of forward-oriented, or anterograde pulsations (average duration of each pulsation 5–8 min, frequency of individual systolic strokes 10–15 per min) alternating with somewhat slower, backward-oriented or retrograde cardiac pulsations (average duration of each pulsation 6–10 min, frequency of systolic strokes 7–12 per min). The highest rate of hemolymph flow was associated with the anterograde pulsations. We studied cardiac functions in diapausing pupae because of the almost complete absence of extracardiac hemocoelic pulsations, which are much stronger and could interfere with the recordings of heartbeat in all other developing stages. The movement of abdomen associated with the heartbeat was extremely small, only some 0.14 to 0.9 µm (i.e. from one 428000th to one 66000th of the body length) and thus was not practical for routine recordings of heartbeat.Simultaneous recordings from multiple thermographic sensors revealed the complete absence of retrograde cardiac pulsations in the head region. There are some indications that the retrograde pulsations were also lacking in the thoracic region of the aorta. The retrograde peristalsis appeared to be used for circulatory functions in the abdomen alone. By contrast, the anterograde cardiac pulsations underwent a profound amplification in the anterior part of the abdomen, entering thoracic aorta with considerable strength before reaching the final destination in the head region. The amplification of anterograde peristalsis was manifested by enhanced hemolymph flow towards the head associated with a two-fold increase in frequency of anterograde heartbeat before reaching the head region. The sensors distributed along the dorsal vessel revealed that the rate of the backward-oriented, retrograde cardiac flow of the hemolymph was also location specific. The rate of flow was lowest at the front of the abdomen, medium in the middle and highest close to the end of the abdomen. The finding of lowest hemolymph circulation at the beginning of the cardiac peristaltic waves suggested that the physiological "raison d’ être” for heartbeat reversal was a need for differential enhancement of hemolymph flow towards the extremities of the immobile pupal body. The switchovers from the retrograde to anterograde cardiac pulsations were usually immediate, while the reciprocal, antero- to retro-switchovers were mostly associated with a brief cardiac arrest. Increasing temperature gradients (in 5°C steps) progressively diminished duration of both reciprocal heartbeat periods. The amplitudes of the cardiac systolic strokes also decreased with increasing temperature while the frequencies were substantially elevated.

N2  - Three experimental groups of adult females of Pyrrhocoris apterus (reproductive brachypterous, diapausing brachypterous, and macropterous with non-diapause type of reproductive arrest) were analysed for their dose dependency of adipokinetic response, sensitivity of the fat body to Pya-AKH and locomotor activity during a 24 hour cycle. The greatest adipokinetic response (lipid elevation after hormonal treatment) was observed in macropterous, lower in diapausing brachypterous and the lowest in reproductive brachypterous females. Macropterous females also exhibited the highest activity of walking, while the lowest locomotor activity was found in diapausing brachypters. Diel changes of adipokinetic response were recorded in all three experimental groups, with maximal response occurring during the day at 6–7 h after the onset of light. On the contrary, the minimal adipokinetic response was found in the night and early after the onset of light. No significant differences in diel rhythms were observed between groups exposed to various day lengths. Diel changes in locomotor activity were found only in reproductive brachypterous females and females of macropterous morph, and showed a diurnal rhythm with only one peak of activity during a 24 hour cycle. In the latter, the rhythmic pattern of walking activity was positively correlated with diel changes of adipokinetic response. This indicates an important role of Pya-AKH in dispersal strategy of macropterous females of this heteropteran.

N2  - The Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica Newman, is an introduced pest on Terceira, one of nine islands in the Azorean Archipelago. Research conducted on Terceira indicates that entomopathogenic nematodes in the families Steinernematidae and Heterorhabditidae provide good to excellent control of Japanese beetle larvae, but the species that have been evaluated are not native to the Azores. An efficacious species that is native to the archipelago might provide increased capabilities for persisting and recycling in Azorean soil and weather conditions. Surveys on the islands of Terceira and Santa Maria resulted in the isolation of two Heterorhabditis strains (São Mateus and Praia Formosa) with good larvicidal activity for P. japonica. Initial bioassays conducted with Steinernema glaseri (Steiner) originally from North Carolina against P. japonica third instar larvae and pupae produced LC50 values of 3.2 × 105 infective juveniles (IJs)/m2 and 0.9 × 105 IJs/m2, respectively. Comparative bioassays of the native isolates and S. glaseri against P. japonica revealed similar larvicidal activity. The LC50s of the São Mateus and Praia Formosa isolates against third instar larvae were 3.64 × 105 and 4.44 x 105 IJs/m2, respectively. The LC50 of S. glaseri ranged from 3.2 to 5.5 × 105 IJs/m2. The higher larvicidal activity of the Azorean Heterorhabditis isolates for P. japonica indicates that native nematodes are as effective as S. glaseri. Heterorhabditid species also have demonstrated ability for persistence and apparent recycling under conditions where sustainable control of this introduced pest is needed. Studies comparing the dispersal behavior of the Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar São Mateus isolate with that of S. glaseri and native and exotic strains of Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) revealed that the H. bacteriophora isolate demonstrated a greater propensity to disperse than other strains in the presence or absence of P. japonica larvae. In the presence of a host, a greater proportion of H. bacteriophora and S. glaseri dispersed than either of the two S. carpocapsae strains.

N2  - The Dermaptera are a small order of insects, marked by reduced forewings, hindwings with a unique and complicated folding pattern, and by pincer-like cerci. Hindwing characters of 25 extant dermapteran species are documented. The highly derived hindwing venation and articulation is accurately homologized with the other pterygote orders for the first time. The hindwing base of Dermaptera contains phylogenetically informative characters. They are compared with their homologues in fossil dermapteran ancestors, and in Plecoptera, Orthoptera (Caelifera), Dictyoptera (Mantodea, Blattodea, Isoptera), Fulgoromorpha and Megaloptera. A fully homologized character matrix of the pterygote wing complex is offered for the first time. The wing venation of the Coleoptera is re-interpreted and slightly modified. The all-pterygote character analysis suggests the following relationships: Pterygota: Palaeoptera + Neoptera; Neoptera: [Pleconeoptera + Orthoneoptera] + [Blattoneoptera + (Hemineoptera + Endoneoptera)]. Blattoneoptera share at least 15 wing apomorphies with the sistergroup Hemineoptera + Endoneoptera and none with the Orthoneoptera and Pleconeoptera; Blattoneoptera: (Grylloblattodea + (Dermaptera + Dictyoptera)); Dictyoptera: (Mantodea + (Blattodea + Isoptera). Dermaptera share 13 wing apomorphies with the sistergroup Dictyoptera. In order to document the intra-ordinal relationships of Dermaptera, 18 new characters of venation and articulation are added to an existing data set and analyzed cladistically. The following relationships are suggested (43 characters, tree length 72, CI 0.819 and RI 0.935). Dermaptera: Karschiellidae + ("Diplatyidae” + ("Pygidicranidae” + (Allostethus indicum + (Anisolabididae + ("Labiduridae” + [Forficulidae + (Chelisochidae + Spongiphoridae)]))))). The taxa in quotation marks are probably paraphyletic. Fossil Dermaptera and "Protelytroptera” show that wing-folding characters were already present in Permian ancestors. The evolution of the dermapteran wing-folding mechanism is discussed and the hindwing is presented as a working "origami” model, which will fold as in living earwigs. The functional role of the wing base in wing folding is examined. Characters in orders and other higher taxa are not independent and cannot be analyzed out of context with their groundplans. Higher systematics is dealing with diametrally different problems than species-level systematics. The necessity of using a different methodology for species-level and higher-level phylogenetics is discussed and recommendations are made.

N2  - I investigated the seasonal changes of cold tolerance and polyol content in adults of Harmonia axyridis to elucidate their overwintering strategy. Adults decreased their supercooling point and lower lethal temperature only during the winter. Although the seasonal trends for both values were almost consistent, there seemed to be considerable mortality, without being frozen, at -20°C in mid-winter. The pattern for seasonal change in tolerance at moderately low temperatures differed among the temperatures exposed: the survival time at -5°C peaked in winter, but the time at 5 or 0°C peaked in autumn. Because both autumn and winter adults were completely paralyzed only at -5°C and survived much longer at 0°C than at 5°C, the survival time at -5°C indicates the degree of chilling tolerance, whereas the time at 5 or 0°C seems to show starvation tolerance. This beetle accumulated a relatively large amount of myo-inositol during winter. Myo-inositol content synchronized seasonally with supercooling capacity, the lower lethal temperature and the chilling tolerance, suggesting that myo-inositol may play some role in the control of cold tolerance in this beetle.

N2  - Voltinism and larval growth pattern were investigated in an edge-of-range population of Coenagrion mercuriale. Coenagrion mercuriale is semi-voltine in Britain and growth is inhibited in winter. The 2nd year group overwinters in a range of instars between the antepenultimate and final instar consistent with the early, asynchronous emergence pattern of this species. A facultative autumnal diapause in the penultimate instar is the most likely mode of seasonal regulation. The broad size distribution of larvae produced by this growth pattern was wider than that found in co-occurring populations of Pyrrhosoma nymphula, a "spring” species with synchronous emergence. The broad size distributions may lead to considerable intraspecific interference between C. mercuriale larvae. Sex ratio in the last three larval instars of C. mercuriale did not differ significantly from unity. A laboratory investigation of the effect of temperature and photoperiod on growth and diapause in C. mercuriale is recommended to determine whether high minimum temperature thresholds for development limit both the width of the temporal niche and microhabitat use by this species at its range margin.

N2  - A series of experiments were conducted to compare the susceptibility of P. regina larvae reared in isolation or in groups to the effects of diet-borne metabolic inhibitors: chlorogenic acid (CGA) and mimosine. Larvae were presented with diets containing 0.4 mM CGA or 0.4 mM CGA in combination with 22 mM lysine or methionine or with diets containing 1.5, 15 or 30 mM concentrations of mimosine. Methionine and CGA caused significantly reduced pupal weights when compared with larvae presented with lysine and CGA. All concentrations of mimosine resulted in 100% mortality with larvae unable to successfully complete pupation even at the lowest concentration. In general, larvae reared in groups were less susceptible to the toxic effects resulting from diet-borne metabolic inhibitors. The results are discussed in relation to the chemical factors that result from the feeding activity of saprophagous dipterans.

N2  - In this study, aspects of the reproductive performance and behaviour of male Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) were investigated. We report that males of clones possessing an autosomal 1,3 translocation conferring insecticide resistance show a weak trend for a reduction in reproductive potential. Clones with the translocation that can produce males but no mating females (androcyclic clones) did not have an additional disadvantage. The age of virgin males and females affected mating success. Young males and females, 0–5 days old, were the most successful with respect to the number of females mated and number of eggs produced. There was a decline in reproductive potential after 9–10 days into adult life for males and after 4–5 days for females. Mating behaviour was observed in the laboratory and described. Some pre-copulatory stroking behaviour by the fore and hind legs of the male was observed. Females occasionally walked in copula sometimes resulting in the disengagement of the male before the termination of mating. Average mating duration in the experimental conditions was 10.5 ± 4.0 minutes and both males and females readily mated more than once.

N2  - Maternal care within the treehopper subfamily Centrotinae has been considered a rare trait. We present observations on maternal care and nymphal behaviour made in 16 rain forest plots in Peninsular Malaysia and Sabah, Borneo, from 1996 to 1998. Females of 11 Centrotinae morphospecies from the tribes Centrocharesini (Centrochares Stål), Gargarini (Ebhul Distant), and Hypsaucheniini (Gigantorhabdus Schmidt, Hybandoides Distant, Pyrgauchenia Breddin, Pyrgonota Stål) produced egg clutches and guarded them. Maternal care was restricted to egg-guarding in all species. Pyrgonota ?bulbosa Buckton eggs hatched successively over a couple of days and females deserted their clutches when most, but not all, 1st instar nymphs had hatched. Nymphs of egg-guarding species lived gregariously and/or by subaggregating, as did some non-guarding species. Leptobelus dama Germar, Gargara semibrunnea Funkhouser, and two Tricentrus Stål spp. were solitary as nymphs and adults.

Factors of mutual exclusion for the different species include spatial (horizontal and vertical), seasonal and behavioural factors. Some geographically widespread species prefer open areas, commonly used for agriculture, but endemic species are localized in the tropical forests of the lowlands, and afford that area the need for special protection.

N2  - This study investigates the influence of microhabitat on the presence of several species of fungivorous beetles in basidiocarps of Fomes fomentarius (L.) Kickx. All dead basidiocarps of F. fomentarius from fragments of forest in an agricultural landscape in Norway were sampled and dissected, and their content of Cis jacquemarti Mellié, 1848/C. alter (Silvferberg, 1991) (did not distinguish between individuals of these two species), C. bidentatus (Olivier, 1790), C. lineatocribratus Mellié, 1848, Ennearthron cornutum (Gyllenhal, 1827) (Ciidae) and Dorcatoma dresdensis Herbst, 1792 (Anobiidae) were identified. Multiple logistic regression models revealed that these species responded differently to the microhabitat variables. The incidence of these beetles was associated with the size (volume), position (height above ground) and moisture content of the basidiocarps. The analyses also indicated possible interspecific interactions between some of the beetles. The presence of some of the species mainly in basidiocarps at particular stages of degradation indicates a successional pattern of occurrence of these species. Together these results indicate that basidiocarps of F. fomentarius are a heterogeneous resource for fungivorous beetles. This has implications for conservation: To preserve the diversity of fungivores, sufficient dead wood has to be left in forests to assure an adequate supply of F. fomentarius basidiocarps of different quality.

N2  - Larvae of Rhipsideigma raffrayi are described in detail and those of Distocupes varians are re-examined. Their morphological structures are evaluated with respect to their functional and phylogenetic significance. Larvae of Rhipsideigma are wood-borers with a straight body and a wedge-shaped head capsule. Most of their apomorphic features are correlated with their xylobiontic habits. The strong mandibles, the sclerotized ligula and the wedge-shaped head enable the larvae to penetrate rotting wood. The broadened prothorax, prosternal asperities, tergal ampullae, the short legs, and eversible lobes of segment IX play an important role in locomotion in galleries within rotting wood. Leg muscles are weakly developed, whereas the dorsal, pleural and ventral musculature is complex. The larval features allow Rhipsideigma to be placed in the clades Archostemata, Cupedidae + Micromalthidae, Cupedidae, Cupedidae excl. Priacma, and Cupedidae excl. Priacma and Distocupes. The monophyly of Cupedidae and Cupedidae, excluding Priacma, so far is only supported by apomorphies of the adults. However, the presence of glabrous patches on the prosternum and of a medially divided field of asperities may be larval apomorphies of the family. A clade, which comprises Rhipsideigma, Tenomerga and probably other genera of Cupedidae with hitherto unknown larvae, is well supported by larval apomorphies such as the broadened prothorax, the presence of coxal asperities and the presence of a distinct lateral longitudinal bulge. Increased numbers of antennomeres and labial palpomeres are apomorphies only found in larvae of Distocupes.

N2  - Naturally occurring veinless specimen of the swallowtail Papilio xuthus show an extremely aberrant colour pattern. In spite of the fact that we have no breeding data, these veinless specimen are provisionally called veins-reduced mutant. In these mutants seven longitudinal veins of the fore wing and five of the hind wing are absent. The absence of wing veins is associated with a loss of the broad black venous stripes that normally are present along the proximal portion of the veins. In addition, missing veins cause a loss of the dislocation of black bands in adjacent wing cells, so that what are discrete black segments in normal wings become continuous bands in the veinless wing. Computer simulations show that the morphology of the striped patterns on both the veinless and veined wing can be explained if the wing margin acts as an inductive source of pattern formation and the veins act simply as boundaries to the propagation of the signal from the wing margin. The vein-dependent patterns by contrast, require that the veins act as inductive sources, at least along their proximal portion. This dual role of wing veins is consistent with prior observations on the biology of colour pattern formation. The unique veinless colour pattern strongly supports the hypothesis that the wing margin is the dominant organiser of colour pattern in this species, and possibly in other Papilionidae.

N2  - Despite their wide distribution and frequent occurrence, the spatial distribution patterns of the well-known gall-inducing insects Mikiola fagi (Hartig) and Neuroterus quercusbaccarum (L.) in the canopies of mature trees are poorly described. We made use of the Swiss Canopy Crane (SCC) near Basel, Switzerland, to gain access to the canopy of a mixed temperate forest up to a height of 35 m. Within one and a half days we scanned 6,750 beech leaves and 6,000 oak leaves. M.fagi showed a distinct vertical zonation with highest abundance in the top-most parts of the canopy as well as a significant aggregation on particular trees. N. quercusbaccarum showed an even more pronounced preference for particular trees and a general preference for Quercus robur over Q. petraea. In contrast to M. fagi, no vertical zonation could be detected. We think that both gall-inducing species have greater powers of dispersal than formerly assumed since they overwinter on the forest floor and yet are able to 1) gain access to the entire canopy, 2) show preference for certain host trees. We found little evidence for the phenological synchrony hypothesis proposed to explain the intertree distribution of N. quercusbaccarum. The highest density of M. fagi galls was in those parts of the canopy exposed to high solar radiation; their host choice is probably determined by micro-climatological factors. The consequences of the distribution patterns of N. quercusbaccarum and M. fagi for their ecological interactions with the host-plant, inquilines and parasitoids (e.g., canopy-layer specific performance linked to plant chemistry, density-dependent parasitism) need now to be subjected to further scientific investigation.

The soma and eggs of newly emerged females were separated and then put in ether to extract and determine their fat content. The fat allocation patterns differed between species. The gregarious outbreak species D. pini and N. sertifer allocated most of the fat to their eggs, whereas the gregarious non-outbreak species, G. pallida, allocated most to its somatic tissues. No modification of these basic allocation patterns was observed with increasing total fat content. In contrast, the solitary non-outbreak species, D. similis and G. frutetorum, invested equal amounts of fat in soma and eggs, and the proportion allocated to the egg load decreased as total fat content increased. That is, they invested additional resources in somatic tissues. Apparently, outbreak species tend to allocate more fat to reproductive tissues than non-outbreak species.

N2  - Insect dormancy responses, in the broad sense of modifications of development, are examined from a general perspective. The range of responses is extraordinarily wide because environments are diverse, different taxa have different evolutionary histories, adaptations are needed for both seasonal timing and resistance to adversity, and not only development but also many other aspects of the life-cycle must be coordinated. Developmental options are illustrated by examining the wide range of ways in which development can be modified, the fact that each individual response consists of several components, and the different potential durations of the life-cycle. The concepts of alternative life-cycle pathways (chosen according to current and likely future environmental conditions) and of active and passive default responses are treated. Also introduced are aspects of variation and trade-offs.Some general conclusions that help in understanding dormancy responses emerge from such an examination. Many options are available (cf. Table 1). The nature of the habitat, especially its predictability, determines the potential effectiveness of many of the developmental options. Any particular set of responses reflects evolutionary history and hence depends on past as well as current environments. It is not necessarily obvious what kinds of selection, especially requirements for timing versus resistance to adversity, explain a particular life cycle. Life-cycle pathways have multiple components, so that components cannot be analyzed in isolation. A given feature, such as delayed development, can have multiple roles. Default responses can be either active (development continues unless signalled otherwise) or passive (development stops unless signalled otherwise), making necessary a broad approach to understanding the action of environmental cues. Even relatively minor effects that fine-tune dormancy responses enhance survival, but may be difficult to detect or measure. Trade-offs are not inevitable, not only when certain resources are surplus, but also because resources in very short supply (constraints) cannot be traded off. Life-cycle components are widely, but not universally, coordinated. These conclusions confirm that the range of dormancy responses is wider, more complex and more integrated than has often been recognized.

N2  - Diapause intensity (DI) is a physiological trait represented by the duration of diapause under given conditions of environment. In many species, it is highly variable, probably being controlled by multiple genes and tends to form a cline in response to the latitudinal gradient of selection pressure. DI clines could be established artificially by crossing between lines of a cricket selected for different levels of DI, indicating the importance of genetic factors in the adaptive variation of DI. However, DI may be modified in response to seasonal cues both before and after the onset of diapause. Polymorphism in the intensity of prolonged diapause may split adults of a single population to emerge in different years. A unimodal distribution of DI may also result in polymodal termination of diapause, if DI variation is so large that chilling in one winter is not enough to terminate diapause for all members of a population. Bimodal termination of diapause after overwintering suggests heterogeneity in the final phase of diapause that requires high temperatures in spring. Polymodal termination of diapause subserves a bet-hedging strategy. Variability in DI thus provides insects with an important means of adaptation to their environments changing in space and time.

All of these species overwinter as adults in diapause. Although they have similar feeding habits, their photoperiodic responses were quite different. Riptortus clavatus, P. c. stali, D. baccarum and N. viridula showed long-day photoperiodic responses with critical daylengths between 13 and 14 h, and were assumed to have three generations per year. The photoperiodic responses of the other five species were different both from those of the above species and from each other. These results suggested that A. fieberi and N. antennata produce two generations per year, and G. rubrolineatum, D. reticulata and E. rugosum have one or two generations per year. Nezara antennata showed a long-day-short-day photoperiodic response with summer adult diapause, which may avoid production of heat-susceptible nymphs in the hottest season. With the exception of N. antennata, the photoperiodic responses resulting in fewer generations were shown to be adaptations to dietary conditions in the field.

N2  - Although some parts of diapause development have been clarified up by endocrinologists, knowledge of the underlying processes remains insufficient. The survey of ecophysiological aspects of diapause development has thus to be limited to inputs and outputs from the blackbox. The terms diapause development, diapause intensity, post-diapause quiescence, horotelic processes of diapause, and tachytelic processes of diapause (reactivation) are defined. Andrewartha’s term diapause development has been accepted because it shows diapause as a dynamic event.In about the last 20 years, some views on diapause development have been updated, while others have fossilised. The assumption that chilling is a general prerequisite for completion of diapause development in all insects still survives in part of the scientific community, in spite of much contradictory evidence and often due to inadequate interpretation of experiments (examples given in figures and tables). On the contrary, it has been generally recognised that in temperate climates overwintering diapause is usually already completed in early/mid winter and the dormancy is then temperature quiescence. The conception of multiple pathways of diapause completion postulates that diapause can be completed either by the normal (slow) progress of diapause development (horotelic processes), or by a faster activation (tachytelic processes). There are important differences between the mechanisms regulating activation and the horotelic processes. Thus, e.g., the photoperiodic response is lost during horotelic completion, while after photoperiodic activation it persists. In addition to photoperiodic activation other kinds of activation are being studied, particularly activation by high temperature.Some conclusions can be made from modern studies on diapause development. In every individual, several (at least two) possible pathways exist that are evidently interlinked and mutually complementary. Thus the time of diapause passed at any condition has to be considered, as well as the exposure to very low temperatures. In temperature studies the experimental range ought to be adequately wide and less affected by a priori assumptions. Stimulation by temperature increase or improvement in food or other conditions has to be considered.The success of diapause completion should be measured by at least four parameters: (1) incidence (%) of developmental steps; (2) duration of delay; (3) synchronization; (4) vigour of post-diapause insects (shown by long-term survival or fecundity). The last two parameters have usually been neglected.

N2  - A laboratory study was carried out on photoperiodic control of prepupal diapause in the egg parasitoid Trichogramma embryophagum (Hartig). All experiments were conducted with an isofemale parthenogenetic strain. The maternal generation was reared at 20°C and photoperiods of L:D = 3:21, 6:18, 9:15, 12:12, 15:9, 18:6, 21:3 or 24:0. The tendency to diapause in the progeny was estimated by rearing the daughter generation at 15°C in the dark. Experiments revealed a long-day type response based on maternal influence on the progeny prepupal diapause. However, significant endogenous fluctuations in the pattern of the photoperiodic curve were revealed in successive laboratory generations reared under constant conditions. The left threshold day-length was very variable, while the right threshold kept relative constancy. Experiments with individual females sequentially offered new host eggs demonstrated that the probability of the progeny entering diapause depends significantly on maternal age. At 20°C and 18L : 6D, the percentage of diapause was maximal (ca 15%) in the progeny eclosed from the eggs laid during 1st – 2nd days of maternal life. Then the proportion of diapausing progeny decreased to 0–5% at days 9–11 of female life and later slightly increased in 15–17 days old females. Thus, endogenous factors play an important role in maternal influence on progeny diapause, particularly in environments close to threshold temperature and photoperiod.

N2  - Chill tolerance (time of survival at –5°C) increased in non-diapausing (reproducing) adults of Pyrrhocoris apterus after a gradual, 4-week-long decrease in ambient temperature from 25° to 0°C. The level of chill tolerance attained after cold-acclimation was considerably lower than that in similarly cold-acclimated diapausing adults. Some physiological changes accompanied the cold-acclimation, irrespective of developmental state (diapause vs. reproduction). They were: A decreased oxygen consumption, loss of body water, an increased haemolymph osmolality, an increased proportion of phosphatidylethanolamines vs. a decreased proportion of phosphatidylcholines in membrane phospholipids, and an increased proportion of linoleic vs. a decreased proportion of oleic acid in phosphatidylethanolamines. Such changes could contribute to the limited potential for cold-acclimation found in non-diapausing insects. Other physiological changes appeared to require the induction of diapause prior to cold-acclimation. They were: Down regulation of ice nucleators resulting in a lowering of the individual supercooling point, synthesis and accumulation of specific "winter” polyols, an increased proportion of palmitic acid in membrane phospholipids; and regulation of the concentrations of Na+ and K+ in the haemolymph. The potential contributions of these changes to the cold hardiness of P. apterus are discussed.

N2  - I investigated effects of density-dependent variation in host plant quality on adult feeding and overwintering success of the leaf beetle Chrysomela lapponica L. During pre-overwintering period adult beetles were fed in the laboratory on host plants, Salix borealis, originating from (a) a site with low density population of C. lapponica, (b) a site with peak density of C. lapponica, and (c) a post-outbreak site. Beetles fed on plants from low density and peak density sites demonstrated similar performance, whereas on plants from post-outbreak site beetles fed longer, gained more weight, and experienced greater mortality during overwintering. Higher water content in these beetles suggests that the main reason for increased winter mortality is insufficient dehydration of the beetles’ bodies, presumably due to low quality food. The total carbon concentration in host plant foliage explained variation in most beetle performance indices, while total nitrogen did not correlate with beetle performance. Damage-induced decrease in quality of host plants from post-outbreak sites (delayed inducible resistance, DIR), associated with increase in carbon-containing defensive compounds, was earlier found to increase larval mortality and thus contribute to the decline in population density of C. lapponica. Results of the current study suggest that DIR can also disturb pre-overwintering feeding and thus increase winter mortality of adult beetles, enhancing post-outbreak density decline.

N2  - Colonies of M. rubra, M. ruginodis and M. scabrinodis were collected in four geographic regions: Kiev, Ukraine (50.5°N, 30.5°E – first two species), Vladimir, Russia (56.2°N, 40.4°E – only last species), St. Petersburg, Russia (59.3°N, 30.3°E – all three species) and Chupa, Murmansk prov., Russia (66.3°N, 33.7°E – last two species). After artificial overwintering experimental cultures consisting of 150 workers and one queen were established and kept at 16, 18, 20, 22, 24 and 26°C under long (22 h) day lengths. The workers reared eggs laid by queens into rapid (non-diapause) brood pupae and diapause larvae, which were removed and counted. The results showed the distinct latitudinal variation in the temperature effects on rapid brood rearing and in the thermal requirements for development. First, the period during which new rapid brood pupae appeared was found to be longer and the total number of pupae produced to be greater in ants from more southern populations. The number of diapause larvae reared by ant cultures was also usually greater, in ants from southern sites. Second, low temperatures reduced the period of rapid brood production and the number of pupae reared to a greater degree in ants from northern populations. It means that northern Myrmica colonies rear rapid brood under lower temperatures evidently worse in comparison with ants from southern regions. Third, eggs and larvae from more northern sites appeared to develop faster than southern brood at temperatures above 16–18°C. This was because brood development in northern populations was more temperature dependent, i.e. characterised by higher slopes of regression lines of development rate on temperature. The sum of effective temperatures decreased with the advance to North. The higher slopes were always associated with higher thermal thresholds for development. We conclude that the reaction norm of Myrmica colonies, in response to temperature, changes according to the local climate in such a way that brood rearing, growth and development of individuals become more temperature dependent in more severe environments with colder and shorter summers. This lead to the increase of the physiological and developmental responses at higher temperatures at the expense of a decrease within lower temperature range. In fact Myrmica colonies from northern populations need on average higher temperatures in their nests for successful production of new adults as compared to southern ants.

N2  - Rhythmic body movements, cyclic gas exchange and heart activity were studied at low temperature (mostly at 5°C) in bumblebee Bombus terrestris foragers. Simultaneous measurements by means of an electrolytic respirometer combined with an optical system by infrared radiation, revealed a co-ordination between discontinuous gas exchange cycles and body rhythmic movements. No distinct correlation was found between intermittent heart activity and body movements. The carbon dioxide bursts were actively ventilated by abdominal vigorous pumping movements. These bursts followed each other with intervals of 25–30 minutes.The periods of heart activity regularly alternated with heart pauses. The frequency of the heartbeat was similar to that of the weak abdominal pulsations (0.2–0.25 Hz) which were imperceptible with the naked eye. All bumblebees displayed abdominal pulsations which were independent of vigorous pumping movements. In bumblebee B. terrestris foragers haemolymph oscillation was assumed at 5°C, as is known in the honeybee and some other Bombus species.

N2  - Adults of Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata are very active at room temperature, and their almost continuous struggling in the respirometer prevents the measurements of the patterns of gas exchange, body movements and heartbeat. The tonic immobility of beetles was evoked by light flashes and by shaking as external stimuli. The immediate reaction to these stimuli was the reflexive closing of the spiracles and the cessation of CO2 release for some minutes, which was followed by a large burst of this gas. The state of the evoked tonic immobility did not influence heartbeat and abdominal pulsations, but the periodically -occurring abdominal-thoracic pumping movements stopped for 2–5 minutes. During the periods of pumping ventilation the metabolic rate was increased about two times.The state of tonic immobility evoked by light flashes lasted 2–6 minutes, but when shaking was applied as a stimulus complete immobility was about two times longer.

N2  - Research of the physiological traits of a long-distance migratory insect, the common cutworm Spodoptera litura, in relation to flight and reproduction, was focused on triacylglycerol (TG) levels and their fatty acid composition.Tethered flight experiments demonstrated that three-day old male moths can fly more than 20 h. Among eight identified fatty acids of which the adult TG is composed, the ratios of the following unsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleic acid (C 16:1), oleic acid (C 18:1), linoleic acid (C 18:2) and linolenic acid (C 18:3), gradually declined with longer flight duration. On the other hand, the TG levels of non-flown males reared for ten days on only water, were the same as those of three-day old males after 12 hr of flight, but the ratios of these unsaturated fatty acids in TG’s remained nearly unchanged. These results suggest that the unsaturated fatty acids in TG are mainly used as a flight energy source.As ovarian development in females of this species occurs shortly after adult emergence, long-distance migratory capacity has been regarded as highly unlikely. In fact, ovarian development was completed within three days after adult emergence and females laid eggs thereafter. During this three day period TG increased in the ovary, accompanied by increasing ratios of unsaturated fatty acids in the TG’s and the ovary eventually occupied most of the abdomen, in spite of a nearly constant level of TG in the abdomen and unchanged ratio of its unsaturated fatty acids. These facts support the transfer of TG from the fat body to the ovary, and further suggest that the mature females utilize the TG deposited in the ovaries as a flight energy source. Then if they migrate a long distance, they use residual TG after flight for egg production.

N2  - Laboratory and field tests support the "voltinism-suitability hypothesis” of host selection at various latitudes as well as in local "cold pockets”: The best hosts for rapid development will be selected by herbivorous insects under severe thermal constraints for completion of the generation before winter. Papilio canadensis and P. glaucus females do select the best hosts for rapid larval growth in Alaska and in southern Michigan, but not in northern Michigan and southern Ohio. In addition to latitudinal patterns, local host preferences of P. canadensis are described in relation to "phenological twisting” of leaf suitability for larval growth in cold pockets with "thermally constrained” growing season lengths. White ash leaves (Fraxinus americana) have the highest nutritional quality (relative to cherry, aspen, birch, and other local trees) throughout June and July for P. canadensis populations inside the cold pocket, but not outside. In all areas outside the cold pockets, even with bud-break occurring much later than other tree species, ash leaves rapidly decline in quality after mid-June and become one of the worse tree host species for larvae. This temperature-driven phenology difference creates a geographic mosaic in host plant suitability for herbivores. However, we also report here that the cold pocket of northern Michigan has basically disappeared since 1998. Implications of these changes are discussed in relation to voltinism and host plant selection. Various physiological and ecological adaptations to thermal unit constraints are evident with both species of naturally hybridizing butterflies (P. canadensis to the North and P. glaucus to the South). The rapid regional climate warming since 1998 in the Great Lakes region has allowed us to document some critical aspects of gene flow via analysis of independent "species-diagnostic” trait clines (including morphological, biochemical, and physiological characters). Narrower black bands on hind-wings, larger fore-wings, larval detoxification abilities for tulip tree leaves, behavioral preference of tulip tree leaves, and species-diagnostic allozymes such as PDG (x-linked) and HK (autosomal) provide evidence of these genodynamics. Laboratory hybridization studies (providing known reference groups) and field observations along the hybrid zone show that gene flow between P. glaucus and P. canadensis has recently been extensive across the historical hybrid zone.

N2  - The development stages of a species may have an identical lower development threshold (LDT) and proportionally different durations. This phenomenon called "rate isomorphy” (RI) has been demonstrated for a number of insect species. In contrast, the growing day degrees accumulated over the period of larval development (sum of effective temperatures SET) should be plastic and vary with environment conditions. The prediction from RI is that, with changing conditions, the uniform LDT should be accompanied by differences in development time which remain proportional at different temperatures. This was tested by investigating the effect of diet on thermal requirements for development of larvae of the polyphagous species Autographa gamma (L.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). The larvae were kept at 15.0, 20.3 and 26.7°C and fed on leaves of 13dicotyledoneous herb and tree species. The proportion of total development time spent on a particular diet was plotted against temperature. The existence of RI was inferred from a zero change in development time proportion with changing temperature. This rigorous test supported RI for 3 of 9 diets where development was completed in all temperatures. The LDT observed on 11 diets where the larvae completed development in at least 2 temperatures varied between 9.3 and 11.0°C while SET varied between 167 and 353 day degrees (dd). Assuming RI, LDT and SET for those 9 diets were recalculated. The recalculated LDT was 10.0°C and SET varied between 177–257 dd. The SET increased with decreasing water content and decreasing nitrogen content of food. Worsening food quality decreased food consumption, metabolic and food conversion efficiency, and the relative growth rate of the larvae. Increasing metabolic costs of development were thus positively correlated with SET. The standardized rate of growth (mg.dd-1) was typical for particular diets. Pupal mass decreased with increasing temperature and, within each temperature, with development length.

N2  - Circellium bacchus is a flightless telecoprid (ball-rolling) dung beetle, endemic to the afrotropical region, where it is found in a few restricted populations in the eastern Cape of South Africa. Its apterous condition and large size (mass ranges from 6 to 12 g) are considered to be adaptations to a semi-arid habitat. This beetle is active in the sun for long periods, walking between widely scattered dung pats, thus is under selection pressure to reduce water loss.C. bacchus has eight spiracles on each side of the body. The metathoracic spiracle and six abdominal spiracles open into the subelytral cavity, which is closed. The mesothoracic spiracle is the largest and most exposed, occurring ventrally in the membrane connecting the prothorax and mesothorax.When at rest a cyclic form of respiration, known as discontinuous gas exchange cycle, is used by C. bacchus, releasing a burst of carbon dioxide approximately once an hour when the spiracles open for about 33 minutes. Flow-through respirometry was used to measure water loss from the thorax (being the head, prothorax and mesothorax) and elytral case (containing the metathorax and abdomen) separately. The total water loss of C. bacchus could be divided up as 65% cuticular water loss from the thorax, 35% cuticular water loss from the elytral case, 4% respiratory water loss from the thorax and no measurable respiratory water loss from the elytral case. 1.51 µg of water is lost for every µl of CO2 emitted during respiration in the thorax. Thus, the main avenue for both respiration and respiratory water loss is via the mesothoracic spiracles, suggesting that the primary function of the subelytral cavity is not to reduce respiratory water loss.

N2  - Four case studies are used to examine the relationships of water, ice nucleators and desiccation in the cold survival of invertebrates and the viability of frozen plant material: the freeze intolerant Antarctic springtail Cryptopygus antarcticus (Willem) (Collembola, Isotomidae), the freeze tolerant larvae of the fly Heleomyza borealis Boh. (Diptera: Heleomyzidae), the freeze intolerant Arctic springtail Onychiurus arcticus (Tullberg) (Collembola, Onychiuridae) and meristems of the currant Ribes ciliatum Humb. & Bonpl.(Grossulariaceae) from Mexico. Prevention of ice nucleation, lowering the water content by removal of osmotically active (freezable) water are critical features of the different cold survival strategies of the three species of invertebrates. In C. antarcticus, which desiccates rapidly by losing water via the cuticle to the atmosphere, the number of ice nucleators (and their activity) increases with lowered ambient temperature. During prolonged cold exposure ice nucleators are masked, but re-activated rapidly by water uptake in this species. Larval H. borealis do not readily desiccate and conserve their body water, 20–25% of it being bound (osmotically inactive). Experiments showed that a high proportion (c. 80%) of slowly cooled larvae survived exposure to –60°C. By comparison O. arcticus is able to sustain up to 40% loss of its body water and desiccation lowers its supercooling point to promote over winter survival. Dehydration leading to partial vitrification of currant (R. ciliatum) meristems improves their viability after cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen. From this comparison of four biological systems, it is concluded that the role of water and its activity at sub-zero temperatures are fundamental to the survival of freezing conditions by all the species studied. Although similar features exist in the four systems, no common basic mechanism was found.

N2  - RFLP clones harbouring multi-copy DNA sequences were isolated from the Pst I sub-genomic library of the indigenous silkworm race, Nistari, and were used for DNA fingerprinting studies in 13 stocks of silkworm, Bombyx mori L. Six multilocus probes produced 180 RFLP markers that showed a high level (98%) of polymorphism and are highly useful in molecular mapping, genotype characterization and marker assisted selection (MAS). The dendrogram derived from UPGMA analysis clearly divides the 13 silkworm stocks into two major clusters: high- and low-yield stocks. Furthermore, adopting multiple regression analyses, the RFLP marker(s) associated with characters of economic importance were identified, a first of its kind for any species of insect of commercial importance. The results obtained create an opportunity of using germplasm stocks directly for isolating specific RFLP band(s) and use it for MAS in breeding programs.

N2  - On the basis of a twenty-year investigation, the life-cycle of Torymus cyanimus Boheman (Hymenoptera: Torymidae), a hyperparasitoid of a gall-forming fly in the Volga-Kama region is described. This parasitoid is the top-consumer in a food chain on Cirsium setosum (Willdenow) Iljin, in which the herbivore is Urophora cardui L. (Diptera: Tephritidae) and the primary parasitoids belong to the genus Eurytoma (Hymenoptera: Eurytomidae). Mating and oviposition behaviour were studied, and the superparasitism and larval cannibalism investigated in the second parasitoid generation. The superparasitism in T. cyanimus evolved in connection with the ovipositor elongation, leading to eggs being laid later when the fly host has already been completely consumed by larvae of Eurytoma serratulae F. Hyperparasitism and larval cannibalism in the second generation of T. cyanimus might account for the evolution of hyperparasitism in this species.

The results showed the importance of adult experience, conditioning and innate preferences on the responses of A. ervi toward volatiles and provided a mechanistic explanation to the high prevalence of A. ervi on aphids on cereals and legumes in central Chile.

N2  - Aquatic Coleoptera in shallow lakes associated with the Canal de Castilla (Palencia Province, Spain) in the northern Iberian Meseta were sampled over the course of a year (spring 1998–winter 1999). These waterbodies are typical plateau wetlands with dense vegetation and vary in permanence and area (from 3.3 ha to 29.35 ha). Oxygen concentration, conductivity and pH were recorded at the time of sampling. Lake area, depth, water permanence and type of vegetation were also taken into account. Ninety two species were collected. Species richness was high in comparison with other wetlands in Spain. The assemblage structure was assessed in terms of three community parameters: richness, abundance and diversity (Shannon index). Their relationships with environmental variables were explored using correlation coefficients. The assemblage composition was analysed by multivariate techniques. First, the sites were classified by means of TWINSPAN. The presence of each species in the different TWINSPAN groups was used to assess their habitat preferences. Second, the sites and species were ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) using the CANOCO statistical package. Richness was significantly correlated with water permanence, conductivity and aquatic macrophyte cover. The first DCA axis was significantly correlated with water permanence and conductivity, but not with any of the other parameters. Conductivity was significantly inter-correlated with permanence. Therefore, water permanence and aquatic vegetation cover seem to be the main factors influencing richness, but only water permanence appears to determine species composition.

Within the Metriorrhynchinae, evidence is presented for the monophyly of the Conderini and Metriorrhynchini and their sister group position. The Trichalina, Hemiconderina and Metriorrhynchina form the tribe Metriorrhynchini. The relationships between the basal lineages of this group are poorly understood. Several clades are distinguished within the Metriorrhynchina, but there is only weak evidence supporting a relationships between them. The distribution of individual clades is discussed.

N2  - Typically, the relationship between insect development and temperature is described by two characteristics: the minimum temperature needed for development to occur (Tmin) and the number of day degrees required (DDR) for the completion of development. We investigated these characteristics in three English populations of Thrips major and T. tabaci [Cawood, Yorkshire (N53°49’, W1°7’); Boxworth, Cambridgeshire (N52°15’, W0°1’); Silwood Park, Berkshire (N51°24’, W0°38’)], and two populations of Frankliniella occidentalis (Cawood; Silwood Park). While there were no significant differences among populations in either Tmin (mean for T. major = 7.0°C; T. tabaci = 5.9°C; F. occidentalis = 6.7°C) or DDR (mean for T. major = 229.9; T. tabaci = 260.8; F. occidentalis = 233.4), there were significant differences in the relationship between temperature and body size, suggesting the presence of geographic variation in this trait. Using published data, in addition to those newly collected, we found a negative relationship between Tmin and DDR for F. occidentalis and T. tabaci, supporting the hypothesis that a trade-off between Tmin and DDR may constrain adaptation to local climatic conditions.

N2  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of bilaterally symmetrical organisms has been introduced as a promising indicator of environmental stress. Stress factors reported to contribute to developmental stability include inbreeding and the presence of resistance genes. In the current study we examined the effect of stress derived from high developmental temperatures, resistance genes and low genetic variation on life history variables and wing FA in Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Three strains were compared: two inbred laboratory strains sharing a similar genetic background but differing in that one strain contained organophosphate (OP) resistance genes, and a third strain that was an outbred OP resistant field strain recently collected from India. There were no strong and general trends that suggested that the OP resistant lab strain was less fit than the OP susceptible strain, although there were some specific among strain differences for some treatments. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of wing traits was higher in the laboratory strains than the field strain, suggesting that inbreeding may cause elevated FA in the study species. There was no evidence that the resistance genes were associated with increased wing FA. Wing FA increased with increasing developmental temperature in females, but the association was less strong in males. There was a significant difference between the sexes in this respect. The results are discussed with reference to the value of FA as a biomonitor of environmental stress.

N2  - A radiochemical assay (RCA) has been used for the measurement of juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis in vitro by corpora allata (CA) from the Eri silkworm, Samia cynthia ricini. Using CA from newly emerged female adults for the bioassay, the most suitable incubation conditions were determined. A high rate of JH synthesis was found in medium TC199 at pH 6.5, 30°C and 4 mM Ca2+. The time course of JH synthesis showed a steady decrease during the first 6 hours of incubation. Under optimal incubation conditions, CA from the 4th and 5th larval instars, pupae and adults were used for measuring JH synthesis in vitro. The highest rates of JH synthesis were found on the 1st day of both larval stages, and then JH synthesis decreased steadily during the following two days of each instar. From the 4th day of the 5th larval instar to the 2nd day after pupation, CA could still synthesize small amounts of JH. However, from the 3rd day of the pupal stage to 12 hours before adult emergence, no JH release was observed. About 6 hours before emergence, CA of both female and male pharate adults regained the ability to synthesize JH. JH synthesis increased to a maximum shortly after emergence and then decreased again during the following two days. During this period, JH synthesis in vitro by CA from females was always higher than that of males. This is the first report on JH synthesis in vitro by CA from both female and male pharate adults and adults of a lepidopteran species, where the adults do not feed, are relatively short-lived, mate only once, and ovarian maturation and vitellogenesis are completed before emergence.

The incidences of diapause by TC 12 : 12 thermoperiods under DD, in which the thermophase was 30°C and cryophases varied from 10 to 25°C, were compared to the effects of thermophotoperiods with the same configuration. Higher incidences of diapause were recorded when larvae were exposed to thermophotoperiods with cryophases of 15–25°C, than under thermoperiods under constant darkness. In addition, larvae exhibited significantly lower percentages of diapause when exposed to cryophases

N2  - A comparative study of the direct influence of single, non-repetitive changes of light and/or temperature on the daily pattern of adult eclosion was conducted in laboratory conditions with the egg parasitoid, Trichogramma embryophagum (Hartig). In all experiments, the entire development occurred under the same regimen (12L : 12D, 20°C). However, just in the day when records of eclosion were made, the time of light-on was changed (from the total absence of a dark period to the 12-h-long scotophase). In addition, in different treatments of each experiment a thermophase (30°C during 2 or 4 hours) was applied in various positions relative to light-on. Results showed that light-on or a temperature step-up could induce eclosion in a certain percentage of individuals practically at any time of the 24-h-long cycle (masking effects). The fraction of adults emerging during 2 h after the beginning of the action of an exogenous factor depended not only on the preceding scotophase duration, but also on the stimulus itself (light, temperature or both). The temperature stimulus was found to modify the responsiveness to light considerably, depending on the order of application of the stimuli. The simultaneous action of light-on and a temperature step-up exerted a more considerable influence than could be expected based on their separate impacts. On the contrary, a high temperature pulse preceding the onset of the photophase inhibited the response of individuals to light-on, evidently acting by phase delay of a circadian rhythm of light responsiveness. These effects were more pronounced in the first half of the 12-h-long scotophase. The data suggest a complex interaction between the exogenous factors in their influence on the daily pattern of adult eclosion.

N2  - Previous behavioural tests indicated that strain recognition and aggregation behaviour could be induced by cuticular hydrocarbons. The aim of this study was to document and to compare cuticular hydrocarbon profiles between different strains of Blattella germanica (L.) (Dictyoptera: Blattellidae) and to relate variations in the general profile of cuticular hydrocarbons with strain discrimination during behavioural tests. Profiles of different strains were remarkably similar qualitatively but presented slight quantitative differences over the 25 identified components. Important differences were observed in dimethylalkane components and these allowed separation of the strains into two groups using multivariate methods. Although we were not able to demonstrate a relationship between strain discrimination ability and differences in cuticular hydrocarbon profiles, we assumed that cuticular hydrocarbons could play two major roles in B. germanica strains. Less variable hydrocarbon profiles could play a role in species recognition and aggregation behaviour and the more variable part could play a role in strain discrimination.

N2  - Electroantennogram responses of the polyphagous leafminer Liriomyza sativae and its generalist parasitoid Diglyphus isaea to host and non-host plant odours of L. sativae were investigated. The odours of healthy leaves can elicit distinct EAG responses in L. sativae. The EAG responses to the odours of the host plants, bean and tomato, were stronger than to non-host plants, Chinese rose and morning glory. Neither healthy host nor non-host plants of the leafminer elicited distinctive EAG responses in the parasitoid, D. isaea. Odours of physically damaged leaves, no matter whether of host or non-host plants, increased strongly the EAG responses of the leafminer and its parasitoid. We compared the EAG responses of D. isaea to bean leaves of different status. The odour of mined leaves elicited distinct EAG responses, which were weaker than those of physically damaged ones. No differences were detected in the EAG response to leaves with empty mines, healthy leaves or an air control. The role of plant odours in host location of the leafminer and its parasitoid is discussed.

N2  - In the mating behaviour of Aphidius ervi Haliday the antennae play a pivotal role in partner recognition and acceptance. Mating failure was always observed when antennal contact was experimentally prevented. The male of A. ervi has filiform antennae, consisting of scape, pedicel and 18–20 cylindrical antennomeres (flagellar segments), which bear numerous types of sensory structures and, interspersed among the multiporous plate sensilla, especially on the 1th and 2nd flagellar segments, scattered pores. A secretion oozes from these pores in virgin males exposed to conspecific females. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that these pores are the external openings of integumentary glands. Behavioural and morpho-functional observations indicated that a double step sex recognition mechanism is present in A. ervi, as in other parasitic Hymenoptera. Basically, female recognition by males appears to be mediated by a volatile sex pheromone, that triggers the behavioural sequence leading to mounting. Then, the female recognizes and accepts the male after antennal contact. This is mediated by the secretion that oozes from the male antennal glands, which acts as a contact pheromone.

N2  - The impact of the arrival of the exotic coccinellid Harmonia axyridis on the biological control and dispersion of apple mites and aphids, and on the vertical distribution of the established coccinellids Coccinella septempunctata and Coleomegilla maculata have been studied. Assemblages of adults of the three coccinellid species were tested on apple saplings and on apple trees against Aphis citricola and Tetranychus urticae. The presence or substitution of adults of H. axyridis for adults of C. maculata or C. septempunctata did not reduce the predation impact on mite or aphid prey. H. axyridis was a more efficient predator of mites than was C. septempunctata and generated lower prey dispersal from host plants. Substitutions of adults of H. axyridis for those of C. maculata, and in some cases of C. septempunctata, resulted in greater reduction in number of aphids. On apple trees, the three coccinellid species occurred at different heights. Neither C. maculata nor C. septempunctata modified their vertical distribution on apple tree over a 24 hour period in response to the presence of H. axyridis.

N2  - The reproductive behaviour of a ladybeetle, Coccinella septempunctata was studied in detail. Males became sexually mature within 8.8 ± 0.3 days at 27°C, while females took 11.2 ± 0.4 days. Males exhibited courtship display in five steps: approach, watch, examine, mount and copulatory attempt. A prominent rejection display was shown by certain females who had not matured sexually, had recently mated or were about to oviposit. Males appeared to recognize females through chemical and some visual cues, such as size and body shape, with the chemical cues possibly playing a more significant role. Multiple matings took place within the same day. There was a gradual decrease with time in reproductive parametres, such as the duration of copulation, the number of copulatory bouts and the latent period from first to subsequent matings on the same day. The interval between mating bouts slightly increased from first to subsequent matings. The sexual status of males and females affected the duration of copulation, which was greatest in the case of unmated males and virgin females. Multiple matings increased the oviposition period, fecundity and percent hatching of eggs.

N2  - The persistence of oviposition-deterring effects of coccinellid and chrysopid larval tracks on females of three aphidophagous coccinellid species was compared. One month old tracks of first instars of the coccinellid Cycloneda limbifer Casey deterred conspecific females from oviposition in choice tests with clean and contaminated substrates. Intraspecific effect of larval tracks in Semiadalia undecimnotata Schneider was statistically significant after 10 days. Although fresh tracks of conspecific first instars effectively deterred females in both tested populations of Coccinella septempunctata L., deterrent effects disappeared when tracks of larvae were only one day old. However, females of C. septempunctata laid fewer eggs on sites with 10 days old tracks of Chrysopa oculata Say or sites with one month old tracks of Chrysopa perla (L.) first instars than on clean sites. In contrast to females of C. septempunctata and S. undecimnotata, C. limbifer females left significantly more faecal spots on clean sites than on sites with 5–30 days old tracks of conspecific first instars. This indicates that sites with tracks of larvae can also effectively repel conspecific females of some coccinellid species from searching.

N2  - The seven taxa of the cicada genus Tibicina (T.corsica corsica, T. corsica fairmairei, T. garricola, T. haematodes, T. nigronervosa, T. quadrisignata, T. tomentosa) which occur in continental France and Corsica were investigated. Extrinsic factors (geographical barriers) and factors intrinsic to the ecology of species were considered in an effort to understand the biogeography of Tibicina. Three patterns related to intrinsic factors were recognised: (1) pairs of taxa with sympatric distributions but with divergent habitat preferences; (2) pairs of taxa with sympatric distributions and similar habitat but with allochronic occurrence; (3) pairs of taxa with similar ecology but with allopatric distributions. When taxa were separated by their habitat, the height of vegetation appeared to be more important than the floristic composition of the habitat. These factors lead to the partitioning of resources in time and space. All taxa occur in secondary vegetations. Human agro-pastoral activity has probably influenced the dynamics of cicada populations and the maintenance of isolation between them.

Larvae of these two genera share ten synapomorphic characters, which support the monophyletic origin of Anillina. Sister-group relationships of Anillina with Tachyina + Xystosomina are proposed on the basis of three shared larval synapomorphies: seta LA5 of ligula absent; coronal suture in first-instar larvae very short or absent; second- third-instar larvae have none or one secondary seta on lateral sides of stipes and labium and none on mandibles.

N2  - This paper presents a revision of the genus Dyscia Hübner, [1825] (Lepidoptera, Geometridae: Ennominae). Examination of types and additional material for most described taxa has resulted in several new synonyms: Dyscia ilivolans Wehrli, 1953 syn. n. and Dyscia duanjiao Yang, 1978 syn. n. are new synonyms of Dyscia fagaria (Thunberg, 1784); Dyscia karsholti Wiltshire, 1991 syn. n. is a new synonym of Dyscia galactaria Turati, 1934; Dyscia dagestana Wehrli, 1934 syn. n. is a new synonym of Dyscia malatyana Wehrli, 1934, and Dyscia rjabovi Wardikjan, 1957 syn. n. is a new synonym of Dyscia negrama Wehrli, 1953. One taxon, formerly treated as a species is reassigned to subspecific level, Dyscia conspersaria ssp. sultanica Wehrli, 1936 stat. rev. Dyscia innocentaria sicanaria (Oberthür, 1923) stat. n. and Dyscia malatyana senecai Wiltshire, 1990 stat. n. are downgraded to subspecies-level. On subspecies-level, Dyscia distinctaria perdistincta Herbulot, 1957 syn. n. is a new synonym of Dyscia distinctaria (Bang-Haas, 1910), Dyscia fagaria alvarensis Wahlgren, 1913 syn. n., Dyscia fagaria albescens Lempke, 1952 syn. n., Dyscia fagaria fusca Lempke, 1952 syn. n., and Dyscia fagaria postdelineata Lempke, 1952 syn. n. are new synonyms of Dyscia fagaria. Dyscia fagaria psoricaria (Eversmann, 1848) syn. n. is a new synonym of Dyscia fagaria favillacearia (Hübner, [1799]), Dyscia holli duponti Thierry-Mieg, 1910 syn. n. is a new synonym of Dyscia holli (Oberthür, 1910), Dyscia malatyana nachadira Brandt, 1941 syn. n. and Dyscia malatyana theodoraria Warnecke, 1941 syn. n. are new synonyms of Dyscia malatyana albersaria Warnecke, 1940 stat. n., and Dyscia penulataria naevata Wehrli, 1953 syn. n. is a new synonym of Dyscia penulataria (Hübner, [1819]). Lectotypes for 22 taxa and neotypes for three taxa – Geometra conspersaria [Denis & Schiffermüller], 1775, Geometra favillacearia Hübner, [1799], and Geometra emucidaria Hübner, [1813] – are designated. One species is excluded from Dyscia, Thysanopyga serena (Dognin, 1906) comb. n. From a total of 72 previously described taxa, 19 are recognized as species.

N2  - Two new species (Hemiptera, Fulgoromorpha, Cixiidae) included in a new genus, Meenocixius gen. n., and associated with Acanthophœnix rubra (Bory) H. Wendl. (Arecaceae) are described from the island of La Réunion: M. bebourensis sp. n. and M. virescens sp. n. This genus shows several autapomorphies in its tegmina venation, very particular within the Fulgoromorpha. Borbonomyndus gen. n., is proposed for another new species, B. pandanicola sp. n. associated with Pandanus purpurascens Thouars (Pandanaceae), and B. pallidus (Synave), previously described as a member of the genus Eumyndus Synave. According to morphological and ethological data, E. bistriatus is synonymized with B. pallidus, of which three different forms are recognized. All species of Borbonomyndus are found associated with Pandanus. These two new genera are endemic to La Réunion. Without taxonomic standing, the subspecies of Brixia belouvensis are synonymyzed and restricted to four different forms. A key is proposed for the Cixiidae of La Réunion, which now includes 12 species belonging to 6 different genera: Achaemenes, Aselgeoides, Brixia, Oliarus (but we show that the species placed in this genus need to be reviewed), Borbonomyndus, and Meenocixius. Monophyly of Eumyndus, from which E. perinetensis Synave is excluded, is substantiated. Following the new interpretation, this genus is now restricted to Madagascar. The species Cubana insularis Muir, from the island of Rodrigues, is transferred to a new genus: Achaebana gen. n. Finally, cixiid endemism and their host-plant associations in the Mascarenes are discussed.

N2  - Changes in the content of protein, glycogen, neutral lipids and sterols were investigated in locust eggs from oviposition until larval hatching. The content of all of these nutritional reserves was higher in the eggs of S. gregaria because of their larger size, although relative changes in utilization or synthesis of these materials during embryogenesis showed a more or less parallel course. The amount of protein increased progressively during embryogenesis, while glycogen and neutral lipids were successively metabolized or utilized for development of the embryo. There appeared significant relative differences in the way of utilizing energetic reserves during embryogenesis between the two species. This was especially manifested by a larger relative decrease in the content of neutral lipids (mainly triglyceride) in the eggs of S. gregaria. Conversely, the eggs of L. migratoria showed a larger relative utilization of glycogen reserves. The content of steroids was higher in the eggs of S. gregaria during the initial 6 days of embryonic development. Later on, during advanced stages of pharate larval development, the steroids were rapidly utilized and decreased in both species. The described changes in utilization of the main energetic resources were correlated with periods of tissue growth and differentiation and with the cuticulogenesis of the growing embryo.

N2  - Secondary plant metabolites (allelochemicals) play a major role in plant-insect interactions. Glucosinolates (GLS) and their degradation products from Brassica species are attractants and feeding stimulants for Brassicaceae specialist insects but are generally repellent and toxic for generalist herbivores. The impact of these compounds on crucifer specialist insects are well known but their effect on generalist predators is still not well documented. The influence of the prey’s host plant on both development and reproduction of an aphidophagous beneficial, the hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus, was determined using the cabbage aphid, Brevicoryne brassicae (a specialist) and the peach aphid Myzus persicae (a generalist) reared on two crucifer plants, Brassica napus and Sinapis alba containing low and high GLS levels respectively. The prey and its host plant differently influenced life history parameters of E. balteatus. The predator’s rates of development and survival did not vary when it fed on the generalist aphid reared on different host plants. These rates decreased, however, when the predator fed on the specialist aphid reared on the host plant with high GLS content plant versus the host plant with lower GLS content. This aphid host plant combination also negatively affected hoverfly reproduction; lower fecundity was observed. As a result, the fitness of the hoverfly was strongly affected. This study illustrates the importance of tritrophic relations in pest management involving predators. The host plant of the prey can have a major influence on the potential of a biological agent to control herbivore species such as aphids.

N2  - The ladybird Coccinella magnifica is typically considered to be myrmecophilous, and primarily associated with the Formica rufa group of wood ants. It is regularly associated with ants of the F. rufa group in north-western Europe. The very limited data on the habitat preference of C. magnifica in the southern and eastern parts of its range indicate that its ant-associations change and that it may even be non-myrmecophilous in this region. C. magnifica might consist of geographically restricted species or semispecies, on the basis of its geographical variation in ant-association. Laboratory and field observations on north-western myrmecophilous populations C. magnifica appear to indicate it is a generalist predator of aphids. Coccinella magnifica’s potential dietary breadth is similar to that of its congener Coccinella septempunctata, which has been used as a model of C. magnifica’s non-myrmecophilous ancestor in evolutionary studies.

N2  - In searching both for food to produce eggs and for suitable oviposition sites, females of aphidophagous ladybirds must be adapted to exploit prey that vary greatly in their occurrence and abundance over both space and time. A simple model of ladybird searching and oviposition behaviour emerged in the 1950s: adult ladybirds are highly mobile in traversing the landscape, but become less active and produce more eggs as their rate of aphid consumption increases. The net result is that most eggs tend to be laid at sites of high aphid density. Laboratory and field experiments and observations over the past several decades have generally supported this basic model, although the linkage between ladybird dispersal activity and local aphid density often appears to be relatively weak. Not all ladybird eggs are laid in patches of high aphid density. Females use resources from limited prey consumption to produce eggs in modest numbers. They may thus be prepared to lay some eggs quickly when they succeed in finding aphids in high numbers, but otherwise they may have little choice but to lay these eggs in suboptimal sites. Upon locating patches of high prey density, females are faced with the decision of how long to remain. The basic model raises the possibility that these females become passively trapped at such patches until local aphid density collapses. Recent studies, however, suggest that detection of oviposition-deterring pheromones may promote earlier departure from prey patches. Females may also have an innate tendency to disperse throughout their lives regardless of local conditions, as a bet-hedging strategy to spread their eggs widely over space. Additional studies are needed to evaluate further the degree to which females actively determine and vary the rhythms of dispersal and reproduction in response to the unpredictable and short-lived nature of populations of their aphid prey.

N2  - Species of Pentatomidae are cytogenetically characterized by the presence of holokinetic chromosomes, a pre-reductional type of meiosis, and a great constancy not only in chromosome number (2n = 14 in 85% of the 250 species analyzed) but also in the sex chromosome determining system (XY/XX).Edessa meditabunda and E. rufomarginata males have 2n = 14 = 12 + XY, and both species present small telomeric positively heteropycnotic bands which are DAPI and CMA bright. In E. meditabunda the NOR region is clearly revealed at the telomeric region of the largest autosomal pair by silver staining and CMA banding. Meiotic behaviour of both species follows the general pattern of the order: autosomes divide pre-reductionally, sex chromosomes are achiasmatic and divide postreductionally, and at both metaphase plates the autosomes become arranged in a circle with the sex chromosomes lying at its center. In E. meditabunda, however, the larger sex chromosome is generally observed at metaphase I forming part of the ring of autosomal bivalents. Bivalents with two chiasmata are frequently observed in E. meditabunda and E. rufomarginata; mean chiasma frequency (6.45 and 6.26, respectively) differ significantly between both species, but differences between populations within each species are not significant.The metaphase plate arrangement of autosomes and sex chromosomes is rather constant in Heteroptera. However, our results in E. meditabunda together with previous reports in other species of the order led us to suggest that the metaphase plate arrangement is more liable to variation at the first meiotic division than at the second one, when it is almost constant. The presence of ring bivalents in both species here analyzed constitutes further evidence against the previous statement of only one chiasma per bivalent in Heteroptera.

N2  - Acidic methanolic extracts of haemolymph, cuticle and eyes of larvae and adults of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria migratorioides (R. et L.), were subjected to thin layer chromatography. The Rf-values as well as the fluorescent colour of the spots under ultraviolet illumination at 350 nm, were compared to those of 12 pteridine standards. Most of the standards showed a major spot, as well as up to 3 additional minor spots, probably due to the presence of isomers and degradation products. The extract of the haemolymph of untreated larvae and adults yielded 6 different spots. Cuticle and eyes had their own specific pattern. Application of methoprene (analogue of juvenile hormone) induced solitary phase-like pigmentation of the cuticle and green-coloured haemolyph. The content of pterin, biopterin, leucopterin, isoxanthopterin, and probably also of lumazin, increased. The melanization of the cuticle nearly completely disappeared. Similar, but weak effects were observed in neem-oil treated locusts. Application of precocene caused a number of changes in the pigment pattern of all extracts. It also induced some melanization of the cuticle in particular in larvae. Many pigment spots were observed which did not correspond to any of the 12 standard pteridines. The classical concept about the pigment composition of locust haemolymph, namely that it is restricted to melanin, carotenes and biliverdin, needs modification.

N2  - Supercooling point (SCP), survival at low temperatures, rate of water loss in dry air at 20°C and survival under desiccating conditions of eggs of Polydesmus angustus (Diplopoda) were determined. The results were compared with those obtained previously for the eight post-embryonic stadia, to obtain an overview of the changes in resistance to cold and desiccation throughout the species' development. The SCP temperatures of egg batches ranged from –14.8 to –30.6°C and were significantly lower than those of the active stadia. Eggs were not affected by prolonged exposure to low temperature above 0°C and survived much better than active stadia when cooled to –6 and –10°C. This indicates that the cold hardiness of P. angustus is highest in the egg stage and decreases during development. On the other hand, the rate of water loss was significantly higher from eggs than from active stadia. When eggs were taken out of their protective nest, they lost water at the high rate of 7% min-1 in dry air. They also survived for a shorter time than active stadia at 76% RH and 20°C. The resistance to desiccation of P. angustus is lowest at the egg stage and increases during development. The results suggest that the life cycle of P. angustus may have responded to selection pressures other than cold and drought, and do not support the hypothesis that cold hardiness and resistance to desiccation are overlapping adaptations in terrestrial arthropods.

N2  - Interclonal variability in the photoperiodic responses of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum and intraclonal differences between wingless viviparous females (=apterae) and winged viviparous females (=alatae) were studied. In 7 clones collected from peas near St.Petersburg the effect of constant diel photoperiods (from 0L : 24D to 24L : 0D at 20°C) on sexual morph determination and dynamics of morph production were recorded. Apterae of 5 clones and apterae and alatae of 2 clones were studied. The mean and age-dependent fecundity of apterae and alatae were compared. The clones studied in detail can be divided in two groups. The first includes clones that produced winged males and had critical photoperiods for female morph determination around 12L : 12D. The second includes clones with critical photoperiods for female morph determination around 17L : 7D; these clones produced wingless males, and one clone produced only oviparae. The intraclonal differences in the photoperiodic limits for ovipara and male production depended on the clone-specific abundance of males. The shapes of the photoperiodic curves for male production also depended on the clone-specific abundance of males. In short-day conditions alatae produced more oviparae and fewer males, and the range of photoperiods that induced ovipara production in alatae was nearly twice as wide as that in apterae. The photoperiodic limits for ovipara and male production differed for apterae and alatae. The fecundity of alatae was lower, although they reproduced for longer and lived longer than apterae. Both apterae and alatae reproduced more intensively over the first 2 weeks. Apterae and alatae began to produce males at the same age. Because of their late onset of larviposition, the reproductive pause that divides female and male production was obscured in alatae. Both apterae and alatae tended to produce initially and finally batches of viviparous offspring, possibly reflecting age-dependent endogenous changes in the hormonal titres in the parents.

N2  - Larvae of Phormia regina (Meigen) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) were reared, in isolation, upon either lamb’s liver or meridic diets that varied in protein- and carbohydrate-content. An artificial diet containing 53% protein (by mass of dry ingredients) resulted in the heaviest P. regina pupae and shortest development time when compared with larvae reared upon lamb`s liver and all other diets. In diets where the concentration of protein was less than that of carbohydrate, the level of carbohydrate became important. In a diet containing 22.6% protein it was neither the diet with the highest (51%) nor lowest (17%) concentration of carbohydrate that adversely affected development. Specifically, an intermediate level of carbohydrate (33.9%) resulted in an extended larval period, together with increased mortality and reduced pupal weights. Larvae reared in groups of 10 on either liver or a diet containing 53% protein were heavier than those reared in isolation. Group-rearing hastened development on liver, but not on the meridic diet. The results are discussed in relation to the nutritional ecology of saprophagous calliphorids.

N2  - I hypothesized that sibling cannibalism is one of maternal investment in that a female controls sibling cannibalism. To test the hypothesis, I conducted a laboratory experiment and field observations to investigate sibling cannibalism in relation to cluster size and cluster site in the ladybird beetle, Harmonia axyridis Pallas. In the laboratory experiment, cluster size significantly affected the number of cannibalized eggs per cluster (R2 = 0.516), while cluster size was significantly affected by the oviposition interval. Furthermore, there was a marginally significant positive relationship between cluster size and the percentage of sibling cannibalism per cluster. In the field, cluster size and the direct distance from a cluster site to an aphid colony (an indicator of intensity of non-sibling cannibalism) significantly affected the number of cannibalized eggs per cluster (R2 = 0.472). Furthermore, there was a significant positive relationship between the direct distance from a cluster to the nearest aphid colony and cluster size. However, there was not a significant relationship between the distance and the percentage of sibling cannibalism. These results may be caused by the weakness of the female’s power to control sibling cannibalism. Thus, a female H. axyridis controls cluster size through the intensity of non-sibling cannibalism, which may be one of oviposition strategies in this species.

N2  - Aphidius ervi Haliday is a parasitoid of natural populations of both Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) on alfalfa and Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) on wheat in Chile. In this study the performance of the aphid parasitoid on both host species was evaluated. Regardless of origin, both females and males of A. ervi were significantly smaller when reared on S. avenae than on A. pisum. Males and females of A. ervi reared on S. avenae on wheat also took significantly longer to develop than when reared on A. pisum. There was no significant difference in the sex ratio of the parasitoid when reared on these two host aphids. Survival of parasitoids from the A. pisum - alfalfa system was significantly lower when reared on S. avenae relative to those reared on A. pisum, but no significant difference in survival on both hosts was detected in parasitoids from the S. avenae - wheat system. Behaviour of parasitoid females during oviposition, such as frequency of encounters, number of attacks and stabbings of host aphids, were significantly higher in the A. pisum – A. ervi interaction than in the S. avenae – A. ervi interaction, regardless of the origin of the parasitoid. Aphid defensive reactions such as kicking or production of cornicle secretion, were significantly higher in the A. pisum – A. ervi than the S. avenae – A. ervi interaction. The results are discussed in relation to the effect of host quality and host aphid body size on parasitoid development.

N2  - The effects of body size on mating success and duration of copulation were investigated in Pyrrhocoris apterus. Under laboratory conditions relative mating success of small and large males was investigated in groups of 2 males (majority sex) : 1 female (minority sex). Large males were recorded significantly more often in copulation than small males when the female was large but not when the female was small. This was also the case when the group size was 24 males : 12 females or population density decreased by increasing the area of the experimental arena. In groups of 2females : 1 male, large females were recorded in copulation significantly more often than small females when the male was large but not when the male was small. Proportion of individuals of the minority sex that copulated was similar for males and females, regardless of body size. The average duration of copulation was similar for small and large males, but shorter for small than large females. The difference in the duration of copulation of small and large females was greater when it was with small rather than large males. The prolonged guarding of large females by small males may be explained by a trade-off between increasing the probability of inseminating an uneasily accessible high quality partner and copulating with more females.

N2  - Phloea subquadrata (Hemiptera, Phloeidae) was observed in two natural reserves of the Brazilian Atlantic forest near Linhares (Espirito Santo). This species exhibits maternal care which is also known for the two other species of the family: Phloea corticata and Phloeophana longirostris. They protect the eggs and also the larvae from predation by covering them with their body. Such behavior is known for other species of Hemiptera, but with some variations. The evolutionary significance of phloeid behaviour is discussed with reference to the behaviour of Hemiptera in general.

N2  - Previous work suggests that submergence of Lycaena dispar larvae during overwintering may play a significant role in this butterfly’s population dynamics. Since potential re-introduction sites in eastern England are prone to regular seasonal flooding, we further studied the species’ submergence tolerance with a view to formulating management protocols conducive to larval survivorship under periodic flood conditions. Simulated flooding regimes using captive-reared larvae showed that enforced submergence has a twofold effect: firstly, a direct increase in mortality after 28 days under water and, secondly, a longer term, post-diapause increase in mortality; manifest either as an inability of larvae to resume feeding, or a failure to complete development. Additionally, there was a marked difference in the response of "early” and "late” diapause larvae; the latter generally succumbing after shorter periods under water, and suffering higher total mortalities. Behavioural investigations suggest that, if afforded the opportunity, diapausing larvae can evade submergence by climbing onto the exposed sections of partially flooded host plants. Significantly, survival on partially flooded plants was found to be comparable to that on unflooded controls. Further re-introductions of L. dispar in the U.K. will probably necessitate a direct translocation of wild Dutch stock. As the flood tolerance of this source population remains largely undetermined, and given that re-introduction site hydrology will be generally unamenable to conservation-oriented manipulation, it is recommended that restoration management be directed towards creating structural diversity in the vegetation of overwintering habitats, thereby providing potential "flood refugia” for hibernating larvae.

N2  - Carabid abundance, species richness and diversity were compared along an urban-rural gradient in Helsinki, Finland. Increased urbanization was found to result in significant reductions in species richness, though the reductions in abundance and diversity were not statistically significant. Forest habitat-specialist species were scarce in rural sites and virtually absent from urban and suburban sites. There was no evidence of higher diversity at intermediate disturbance levels (suburban sites), as predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Species with flight ability and the ability to utilize open habitat were more predominant in urban and suburban sites. Flightless species were more predominant in rural and suburban sites. Carabid abundance data were sufficient to reveal the negative impact of urbanization, so similar studies could be conducted in regions where carabid taxonomy is poorly known. Species composition patterns do, however, provide invaluable information. To conclude, if biodiversity is to be maintained in urban areas, priority must be given to the provision of those habitat features which are essential for sensitive species, such as decaying wood and wet microhabitats. These must be incorporated into urban green networks in particular, if biodiversity and species other than common generalists are to benefit from them.

N2  - Slugs are important pests of many agricultural crops, especially oilseed rape. The carabid beetles Pterostichus melanarius Illiger and Poecilus cupreus L. are among the most abundant large carabid beetles of European arable land and were therefore explored as potential slug antagonists. Damage to oilseed rape caused by the slugs Deroceras reticulatum Müller and D. laeve Müller in the presence or absence of P. melanarius and P. cupreus was observed in the laboratory. Whereas P. cupreus failed to reduce damage to oilseed rape by D. reticulatum, P. melanarius significantly reduced slug damage. However, P. melanarius was unable to protect oilseed rape from damage by D. laeve. This can be explained by the fact that D. laeve caused damage to oilseed rape below ground, where P. melanarius did not encounter the slugs. According to our laboratory experiments P. melanarius has the potential to reduce slug damage to oilseed rape by D. reticulatum.

N2  - A nonpigmenting strain of Serratia marcescens Bizio isolated from dead and apparently diseased wild apple maggot flies, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh), was shown to be pathogenic to healthy apple maggot flies upon ingestion. The microorganism was detected in live adult alimentary canal organs four days post ingestion but produced death in some flies within 24 h when flies fed on a cell concentration of 4.7 × 104 cfu/ml and within 8 h when flies fed on filter-sterilized culture medium that previously contained a 21 h culture of S. marcescens. Increasing the cell concentration 10,000 fold did not lead to an increased rate of kill. Young flies (7–10 days old) were more susceptible to infection leading to death than were older flies (21–28 days old). The potential use of S. marcescens cells as control agents against apple maggot flies is negated by their pathogenicity to vertebrates; however, the potential use of toxic compounds produced by this strain of S. marcescens is discussed.

N2  - Emergence of Coenagrion mercuriale and Ceriagrion tenellum was examined in a mixed population at their northern range margin in Britain. Mortality at emergence was quantified in C. mercuriale. Consistent with their larval diapause characteristics, both species had an asynchronous emergence pattern, typical of "summer” species. Daily emergence of C. mercuriale was positively correlated with the duration of sunlight on the previous day (controlling for season) and its emergence period was found to be shorter than that observed in its core populations in Central and Mediterranean Europe. No differences were found between the patterns of emergence of the sexes in either species. Sex ratio at emergence differed significantly from 1:1 (at 1.35 : 1 - males : females) in C. mercuriale but not in Ceriagrion tenellum (at 1.04 : 1). Body size at emergence declined more steeply with time in females than in males of C. mercuriale because large size may confer a greater reproductive advantage in females (larger females may be more fecund) than males in non-territorial odonates. Percentage mortality of C. mercuriale at emergence was low (4.9% including deformed individuals), the main cause of mortality being deformity.

N2  - The systematics of the genus Zabrus Clairville, 1806 is currently based on morphological characters that show a high degree of parallelism. The aim of this study is to find new characters in the female genitalia, which give a better understanding of the phylogeny of the genus and result in a new classification based on monophyletic taxa (subgenera and species groups). For this purpose slides of the whole female reproductive tract were studied under light microscopy and the gonocoxa IX under scanning microscopy. The study of species belonging to eight subgenera of Zabrus, and of twelve subgenera of its sister taxon Amara, shows that Zabrus is characterised by the lack of a spermatheca. This apomorphy is reported for the first time in carabids, and corroborates the monophyly of the genus in comparison to Amara. A villous canal that is intimately joined to the distal bursa copulatrix was found in both genera and in species of related tribes. This feature could be an apomorphy of the Harpalidae sensu Deuve (1988). However, only in Zabrus does the villous canal end in a long falciform head, which is probably another autapomorphy of the genus. It is postulated that the primitive bursa copulatrix of the genus was made up of a moderately inflated basal half and an elongated and simple distal half. This pattern is found in species of the subgenus Zabrus, which are widely distributed, and the subgenera Euryzabrus, Platyzabrus, and Epomidozabrus, which are endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. Extra lobules arising in the region where the two parts of the bursa meet, and cup-like infoldings of the distal bursa are possible apomorphic states that characterise the subgenera Pelor and Iberozabrus. Gonocoxite 2 does not have the strong and short spines found in species of related taxa. Differences in size and shape of both gonocoxites, distribution of setation and microtrichia, and presence of furrow "pegs” are characters of potential phylogenetic interest, which should be thoroughly investigated in other subgenera.

N2  - Comparative analyses of interspecific data in evolutionary biology usually require specific methods to remove the effects of phylogenetic inertia. When phylogenetic inertia is not considered, the Canarian Pimelia species show a positive, and almost significant (Prob. = 0.066) correlation between nuclear genome size and body size. However, after controlling for phylogenetic inertia there was a negative and significant correlation (Prob. = 0.007 to 0.017, depending on the DNA fraction considered). Such a change in the relationship after controlling for phylogenetic inertia is rarely reported. Moreover, the relationship usually reported is positive and thought be a consequence of species having a similar number of cells at the same stage of development. The aim of the present study is to report a case of a negative correlation, but not to explain the causal mechanism involved in genome size variations or propose a formal hypothesis on the specific links between DNA content and body size. However, a common explanation of the change in the relationship, i.e., positive to negative, is suggested. Moreover, the data available on the highly repetitive, non-coding satellite DNA allows us to analyse the specific pattern exhibited by this fraction.

N2  - Exorista sorbillans, the uzi fly, is a serious tachinid pest of silkworm and is present in all silk producing areas of Asia. Assuming that E.sorbillans was accidentally transported from West Bengal to southern states of India, its population genetic structure was studied using 13 ISSR, 3 RAPD, two sets of universal primers and two sets of primers designed from a lepidopteran repeat sequence. Statistical analyses of DNA markers revealed significant genetic variability between the E. sorbillans populations from 4 different geographic locations (within 400 km of one another) in the southern states and the one from West Bengal (Murshidabad). Multivariate and discriminant function analyses indicate that the E. sorbillans from south India has diverged from the original gene pool of West Bengal and is suitable for studying the microevolution of adaptation to the conditions prevailing in the different cocoon producing areas in India.Abbreviations used.

N2  - Experiments on copula duration indicate that the nature of mate competition and sperm storage in the large thistle aphid, Uroleucon cirsii (L.), differs from that in the well-studied yellow dung fly, Scatophaga stercoraria (L.). Unlike the situation in the dung fly, second copulas are shorter on average than first copulas for both individual males and females. This suggests that male aphids have a limited amount of sperm at their disposal and that the females capacity to store sperm is limited as could be expected when males were not able to displace sperm from former copulas.

N2  - This study investigated whether Lathrolestes ensator, a parasitoid released as a biological control agent against the European apple sawfly in Canada, is successfully attacked by the cocoon parasitoid A.nigrocincta. In a no-choice situation in the laboratory, there was no significant difference between the acceptance of unparasitized hosts and hosts containing an egg of L. ensator by females of A.nigrocincta. In addition, A.nigrocincta attacked mature larvae of the larval parasitoid to the same degree as they attacked unparasitized hosts. Survival of A.nigrocincta offspring was close to 100% regardless of whether they developed in unparasitized hosts, in hosts containing an egg of L. ensator or in host cocoons containing mature larvae of L.ensator. This is discussed in the context of the possibility of releasing A.nigrocincta as an additional biological control agent of the European apple sawfly.

N2  - Components of daily and seasonal timing systems in insects are reviewed. Photoperiod indicates seasonal position reliably, but signals can be much modified by habitat, latitude and season. Several receptor features and pigment systems are known, with different daily, seasonal and general functions, including differences between circadian and seasonal reception. Clocks can serve several different purposes, functioning as daily oscillators, interval timers or through successive requirements. The molecular functioning of circadian clocks is best known, but even so there is considerable complexity and diversity and much remains to be discovered. We know relatively little about the internal states that provide information for timed responses (such as the photoperiodic "counter”), about the central controlling mechanism, or about the effectors that transmit output signals. Nevertheless, temporal responses serve a very great range of purposes in insects, and the reported complexity in all of the components of timing systems reflects complex ecological needs across daily and seasonal intervals. The variety of components and the complexity of interactions reported (even within species), as well as the diversity of such elements as photosensitive pigments, molecular clock function and potential neurotransmitters, suggests that – unlike some earlier expectations – there is no single master clock for all timing functions in insects.Insect photoperiodism and rhythmicity have been studied by both observational or direct approaches (examination of system elements or devices, and qualities such as survival), and by inferential or indirect approaches (such as interpretation of various responses to photoperiod, modelling, and estimating fitness). Many students work with only one approach, but the power of different approaches is not equal, and knowledge at one level may not give answers at another. These difficulties tend to limit our understanding of the linkages among components.This overview suggests several lessons for the study of photoperiodism and rhythmicity. There are multiple elements, complex integration and a diversity of clocks, showing that different processes serve different purposes. The diversity of findings also results from the fact that different investigative approaches, which depend on the question being asked and on the perspective of the investigator, can influence the outcome of the investigation. Given these complexities, I believe that the key to interpreting photoperiodic and circadian responses is their ecological value. Notwithstanding the interest of timing mechanisms or their parts and of specific responses, daily rhythms and seasonal timing are best understood through the essential context provided by the ecological demands on the actual organisms under study.

N2  - While observational studies led to the assumption that water or moisture (W/M) is a prerequisite for diapause development, the experimental research indicates rather the opposite: usually W/M is needed as late as for the post-diapause resumption of morphogenesis. Recent examples for this type of regulation of dormancy are given: Eggs of the tettigoniid Stictophaula armata, eggs of the grasshopper Oedaleus senegalensis, adults of the bruchid Bruchidius atrolineatus, adults of the endomychid Stenotarsus subtilis (= S. rotundus). In the late diapause of the noctuid Busseola fusca and in eggs of the chrysomelid Homichloda barkeri, moisture is assumed to be the diapause terminating cue. Fall in temperature is assumed decisive for termination of pupal diapause in the saturniid Schausiella santarosensis, although the effect of intense rain after a long dry period has not yet been excluded. Effects of intense changes in environmental conditions and of gradual decrease in diapause intensity with time have often been neglected.

N2  - Cold-season beetles, Catops nigricans Spence, Choleva agilis Illiger and Choleva elongata Payk., i.e. beetles which start to lay eggs in autumn, which are active during the winter in the adult stage and develop from the egg stage to the adult stage mainly during the winter months, were collected from various locations in north-western Europe and reared in the laboratory at varying temperatures and photoperiods.Reproduction of all species started in autumn and continued during the winter months. Highest reproductive and survival rates occurred at low temperatures and within a small thermal window ranging from 5° to 10°C: The fitness of individuals decreased at higher and lower temperatures. The lower thermal threshold for all developmental stages was in the range from –5°C to +2°C. The metabolisms of the species were independent of temperature in both dormant and non-dormant stages and were elevated in the low temperature range in comparison to other species which show a temperature-dependent reaction pattern.Optimal dates for reproduction were determined by the duration of an obligatory adult summer diapause. In C. nigricans, which favours the litter layer of deciduous forests, this duration was fine-tuned by exogenic factors, such as photoperiod and temperature. In contrast, the soil-inhabiting species Ch. elongata showed a homeostatic response pattern, independent of temperature and photoperiod. Heritability (h2) of the duration of diapause was approximately 0.26 in C. nigricans, less pronounced in Ch. agilis (ca. 0.12) and not evident in the subterranean species Ch. elongata.All three species compensated for the vagaries of climate through bet-hedging tactics. Bet-hedging is so pervasive that a recent substantial increase in temperature seems to have a negligible effect on the distribution pattern of all three species. Based on life-history data it is conceivable that both soil-inhabiting Choleva species, which require a relatively low thermal sum for their development, were already present in western Europe during the sub-arctic conditions when ice shields reached their maximum extension during glacial periods by shifting their activity from the cold to the warm season. The Atlantic fringe north of the Pyrenees, where the climate was not cold enough for permafrost during glacial stages, was probably the only refuge where Ch. elongata might have survived. In contrast, the Mediterranean region should have been the northernmost refuge for C. nigricans during glacial periods. This species has relatively high day-degree requirements (= 1150 d°) for individual development when compared to both Choleva species (= 700 d°).

N2  - The cabbage armyworm, Mamestra brassicae, enters diapause in the early pupal stage. Pupal diapause is induced by rearing the larvae under short day lengths. We previously demonstrated that feeding Dopa during last larval instar induces pupal diapause even under long day lengths. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which pupal diapause is induced after experiencing short day lengths or fed Dopa under long day lengths, we analyzed gene expression in the brain of M. brassicae larvae under both of these conditions using a subtractive hybridization technique. After the secondary screen, 49 clones and 28 clones were identified as short day length or Dopa-feeding specific clones, respectively. All of these genes were sequenced and, using the base sequences of these clones, primers were synthesized. To confirm the genes enhanced specifically by these conditions, quantitative real-time PCR was carried out. This quantitative PCR analysis identified 15 and 1 clone whose expression was enhanced by the short day length conditions or Dopa-feeding, respectively. Among these clones, the gene with a high level of identity to receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK) from Heliothis virescens is the most dramatically up-regulated under both conditions.

N2  - Many stress-induced genes, including those related to the insect humoral immune response, are upregulated during diapause even in the absence of stress. We further test the relationship between stress genes and diapause in Sarcophaga crassipalpis by cloning sarcotoxin II, a member of the attacin family, and examining its expression pattern in relation to pupal diapause. Unlike several other stress-related genes, sarcotoxin II is not developmentally upregulated during diapause, but it remains fully responsive to immune challenge. Interestingly, the elevation of sarcotoxin II mRNA in response to body wall injury, but not immune challenge, is initiated more slowly and persists longer in diapausing pupae than in nondiapausing individuals.

N2  - Potential involvement of circadian clock genes in so far unknown mechanism of photoperiodic time measurement is an important question of insect life-cycle regulation science. Here we report about the cloning of full-length cDNA of the structural homologue of the Drosophila's timeless gene in Chymomyza costata. Its expression was compared in two strains: a wild-type strain, responding to short days by entering larval diapause and a npd-mutant strain, showing no photoperiodic response. The timeless mRNA transcripts were not detectable by Northern blot analysis in the fly heads of npd-mutants, while they were detectable and showed typical daily oscillations in the wild-type strain. After disrupting the normal process of timeless transcription in the wild-type strain by injection of timeless double-strandRNA into early embryos of wild-type (RNAi method: Kennerdell & Carthew 1998, 2000), a certain proportion of the individuals adopted a npd-mutant phenotype, showing no-diapause in response to short-daylength. Cloning of genomic DNA fragments revealed that npd-mutants carry a different allele, timelessnpd, with a 13-bp insertion in an intron positioned within the 5'-leader sequence. Genetic linkage analysis showed that the 13-bp insertion (a marker for timelessnpd) and the absence of response to short days (a marker for npd-phenotype) are strictly co-inherited in the F2 progeny of the reciprocal crosses between wild-type and npd-mutant flies. Such results indicated that the locus npd could code for the timeless gene in C. costata and its product might thus represent a molecular link between circadian and photoperiodic clock systems in this fly.

N2  - Wild females of Pyrrhocoris apterus exhibit seasonal changes in neuroendocrine activity and, consequently, reproduction. Long days (18 h light/6 h dark) (LD) stimulate reproduction, whereas short days (12 h light/12 h dark) (SD) induce reproductive arrest (diapause). This study reveals how photoperiod influences the expression of the circadian clock gene, period (per) in the insect’s head. There is only a weak diurnal rhythm in per mRNA expression under LD and SD. However, levels of per mRNA are consistently higher (up to 10-fold) under SD than under LD. The influence of photoperiod on per gene expression is linked to a developmental output (diapause vs. reproduction); mutant females, reproducing under both LD and SD, show low per mRNA levels under both photoperiodic conditions. Thus, the magnitude of per gene expression may be important to the translation of photoperiodic signals into a hormonal message. Levels of per mRNA are related to properties of locomotor activity rhythms. Low per mRNA levels (displayed by wild females in LD and mutant females in both LD and SD) are associated with long free-running periods (τ~26–27 h) and late peaks of activity (ψR,L~10–12 h), whereas high per mRNA levels coincide with short free-running periods (τ~24 h) and early peaks of activity (ψR,L~4-6 h). Overall, the data provide a background for a molecular approach to the long-standing question about the role of the circadian system in insect photoperiodism.

N2  - The effect of photoperiod on nymphal development in the cricket Modicogryllus siamensis was studied. In constant long-days with 16 hr light at 25°C, nymphs matured within 40 days undergoing 7 moults, while in constant short-days with 12 hr light, 12~23 weeks and 11 or more moults were necessary for nymphal development. When nymphs were transferred from long to short day conditions in the 2nd instar, both the number of nymphal instars and the nymphal duration increased. However, only the nymphal duration increased when transferred to short day conditions in the 3rd instar or later. When the reciprocal transfer was made, the accelerating effect of long-days was less pronounced. The earlier the transfer was made, the fewer the nymphal instars and the shorter the nymphal duration. The decelerating effect of short-days or accelerating effect of long-days on nymphal development varied depending on instar. These results suggest that the photoperiod differentially controls the number of nymphal instars and the duration of each instar, and that the stage most important for the photoperiodic response is the 2nd instar.

N2  - The brain and subesophageal ganglion (BR-SG) of the commercial silk worm, Bombyx mori, were stained immunohistochemically at the larval stage for circadian clock neurons with antibodies against Doubletime (DBT) of B. mori and Period (PER) of Periplaneta americana. The BR-SGs were also stained with antisera against [Arg7]-corazonin, which has been known to be present in B. mori and co-localized with PER in Manduca sexta, and against [His7]-corazonin, a homolog identified in other species. From co-localization of [Arg7]-corazonin and PER-like reactivities in the pars lateralis, [Arg7]-corazonin is suspected to be a downstream regulator of the circadian clock in M. sexta. DBT- and corazonin-like immunohistochemical reactivities were found in both the neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis (PIC) and pars lateralis (PL) in B. mori. Small numbers of neurons shared both reactivities against anti-DBT and anti-corazonin. The majority of the immunopositive cells were common to both corazonins, but some cells were unique in expressing either reactivity against [His7]-corazonin or [Arg7]-corazonin only. The results suggest that there is a diversity in the clock output pathway among lepidopterans and that [His7]-corazonin may be present in B. mori, as well as [Arg7]-corazonin, although the former has not been chemically identified in this species. Corazonin may be a downstream regulator of circadian clocks in B. mori because of the co-localization of [His7]-corazonin at PIC and [Arg7]-corazonin at PL with anti-DBT.

N2  - Photoperiodic control of diapause termination was systematically investigated in Pseudopidorus fasciata. In 24 h light-dark cycles, the rate of diapause termination in this species depended on photoperiod. The critical night length (CNL) for diapause termination was 10 h, 0.5 h shorter than that for diapause induction. Night-interruption experiments with T = 24 showed that diapause was effectively terminated when the scotophases separated by light pulse were shorter than the critical night length (10 h); no developing individuals were found if the duration of the pre-interruption scotophase or the post-interruption scotophase exceeded the CNL. A 15-min light pulse was sufficient to reverse the effect of long night when it was placed 8 h after lights-off. Resonance experiments with a constant photophase of 12 h or 16 h and various scotophases of 4–80 h showed an hourglass-type photoperiodic response, where no rhythmicity was found. In another resonance experiment with constant scotophase of 8 h and various photophases of 4–72 h, all individuals developed into cocoons. In the Bünsow experiment, the response curve showed two apparent peaks for diapause termination, one being 8 h after lights-off, and another 8 h before lights-on. However, there was no periodic rhythmicity, which again indicates an hourglass principle. The results lead to the conclusion that the same photoperiodic clock mechanism (a long-night measuring hourglass) is involved in both diapause induction and termination.

N2  - The receptor for photoperiodism in nymphs of Poecilocoris lewisi was examined using a phosphorescent paint, which absorbs light energy and emits phosphorescence in the dark. This species shows a facultative diapause in the fifth (final) nymphal instar and its induction is primarily controlled by photoperiod in the fourth instar. The incidence of diapause in the fifth instar was determined after exposing selected regions of the body surface to a longer photophase than the rest by applying a phosphorescent paint in the fourth instar. The incidence of diapause was significantly lower in insects with their compound eyes painted than in control insects at near-critical daylengths. However, painting the central part of the head had no effect. It is concluded, therefore, that the compound eyes are the principal receptor for photoperiodism in nymphs of P. lewisi. This is the first report implicating the compound eyes in the reception of photoperiod in nymphal insects.

N2  - Ceratophysella sigillata (Collembola, Hypogastruridae) has a life cycle which may extend for >2 years in a temperate climate. It exists in two main morphs, a winter-active morph and a summer-dormant morph in central European forests. The winter-active morph often occurs in large aggregations, wandering on leaf litter and snow surfaces and climbing on tree trunks. The summer-dormant morph is found in the upper soil layers of the forest floor. The cryobiology of the two morphs, sampled from a population near Bern in Switzerland, was examined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry to elucidate the roles of body water and the cold tolerance of individual springtails. Mean (SD) live weights were 62 ± 16 and 17 ± 6 µg for winter and summer individuals, respectively. Winter-active springtails, which were two feeding instars older than summer-dormant individuals, were significantly heavier (by up to 4 times), but contained less water (48% of fresh weight [or 0.9 g g-1 dry weight]) compared with summer-dormant animals (70% of fresh weight [or 2.5 g g-1 dry weight]). Summer-dormant animals had a slightly greater supercooling capacity (mean (SD) –16 ± 6°C) compared with winter-active individuals (–12 ± 3°C), and they also contained significantly larger amounts of both total body water and osmotically inactive (unfrozen) water. In the summer morph, the unfrozen fraction was 26%, compared to 11% in the winter morph. The ratio of osmotically inactive to osmotically active (freezable) water was 1 : 1.7 (summer) and 1 : 3.3 (winter); thus unfrozen water constituted 59% of the total body water during summer compared with only 30% in winter. Small, but significant, levels of thermal hysteresis were detected in the winter-active morph (0.15°C) and in summer-dormant forms (0.05°C), which would not confer protection from freezing. However, the presence of antifreeze proteins may prevent ice crystal growth when feeding on algae with associated ice crystals during winter. It is hypothesised that in summer animals a small decrease in freezable water results in a large increase in haemolymph osmolality, thereby reducing the vapour pressure gradient between the springtail and the surrounding air. A similar decrease in freezable water in winter animals will not have such a large effect. The transfer of free water into the osmotically inactive state is a possible mechanism for increasing drought survival in the summer-dormant morph. The ecophysiological differences between the summer and winter forms of C. sigillata are discussed in relation to its population ecology and survival.

N2  - Habitats of pre-hibernating gregarious larvae of the endangered Marsh Fritillary butterfly (Euphydryas aurinia) were studied in field in Western Bohemia, Czech Republic. The species inhabits moist seminatural meadows managed by light grazing and haymaking; the only local host plant is Succisa pratensis. The redundancy analyses of the vegetation composition (around 166 nest-bearing and 381 unoccupied host plants) showed that nest presence was positively associated with short cushion-forming grasses (esp. Nardus stricta). It was negatively associated with competitively superior tall grasses (e.g., Deschampsia caespitosa) and tall herbs. Comparison of Ellenberg’s indicator values of vegetation in occupied vs. unoccupied plots revealed that the nests were more often found in drier, nitrogen-poorer and more acidic conditions than unoccupied plants. Multiple regressions of nest presence against architecture of the host plants (170 occupied, 1280 unoccupied) revealed that the nests were associated with densely clumped host plants, low to medium height of sward and mechanical disturbance. The patterns agree with our knowledge of the biology of the larvae: short sward (related to low nitrogen, humidity, and low pH) facilitates larval basking; high host density reduces the likelihood of starvation. Sod disturbance facilitates host plant germination. The conditions favourable for the nests were also favourable for the host plant, but the plants grew in broader range of conditions than that occupied by the nests. The abandoning of a site results into a situation when the conditions first become intolerable for the butterfly, and ultimately for the plant. Since grazing and mowing have a different impact on vegetation composition and architecture, we propose that the studied populations have persisted in a semi-dynamic state in the two modes of management. Conservation management should mimic the dynamics of traditional land use on the smaller scales of extant colonies.

N2  - Despite the impact of parasitoids on insect populations being extensively studied, indirect parasitoid-mediated effects remain rarely documented in natural communities. We examined the influence of shared parasitoids on the interactions between two functionally monophagous moths, Nonagria typhae and Archanara sparganii. The moths showed a considerable variation in terms of relative abundance and the degree of phenological synchrony between the species. On average, parasitism levels caused by shared parasitoids did not differ between the two host species. Relative parasitism levels of the two hosts, however, varied considerably among different samples. Percentage parasitism of the scarcer species, A. sparganii, thus could not be fully explained by that of the dominant species, N. typhae. The results indicated that A. sparganii may benefit from the presence of N. typhae. In particular, both low relative density as well as high phenological synchrony with N. typhae reduced parasitism levels in A. sparganii. The case thus indicates the presence of parasitoid-mediated indirect effects between the coexisting herbivores. The patterns of host use observed in this study are consistent with the scenario of frequency-dependent host use caused by changes in parasitoid behavior. Such a host use by parasitoids is suggested to promote numerical stability and coexistence of the moth species in the system studied.

N2  - The duration of development, survivorship and adult size were compared for the larvae of Amara aenea reared in the first generation on pure diets of seeds (Stellaria media, Capsella bursa-pastoris, Tussilago farfara, Plantago major, Urtica dioica, or Potentilla argentela), or a pure diet of yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae), and on a mixed diet of seeds and mealworm larvae (T. molitor, S. media and C. bursa-pastoris). To ascertain any long-term effects of pure diets, the beetles were reared on the same pure diet for several generations, or on different pure diets in different generations. The hypothesis that the larvae are primary omnivorous was tested. The evidence that the larvae of A. aenea are primary omnivorous was obtained by revealing that the larvae reared on the mixed diet of insects and seeds survived better, and developed faster in larger adults than those reared on the pure diets of seeds or insects. When the beetles were reared on the same pure diet for several generations, survivorship, and in most cases also the duration of development, did not change. However, when the beetles were reared on a different pure diet each generation, survivorship significantly decreased in successive generations.

N2  - Like adults, larvae of the myrmecophilous ladybird Coccinella magnifica are rarely attacked by Formica rufa ants on foraging trails, but more often attacked on ant-tended aphid colonies. Larvae of the non-myrmecophile Coccinella septempunctata, to which C. magnifica was compared, were more readily attacked by ants in both situations. To avoid or counter ant aggression when foraging for aphids, C. magnifica larvae exhibit three main tactics: they may feed on un- or non-tended aphids; when feeding on tended colonies they often carry prey away, minimising time spent there; and if attacked, they use limited chemical defence. No novel behaviours were found in C. magnifica larvae, not occurring to some extent in C. septempunctata. Coccinella magnifica eggs were laid distant to ant-tended aphids, although closer to un- or non-tended aphids.

N2  - The ability of the aphidophagous coccinellids Cycloneda limbifer Casey and Ceratomegilla undecimnotata (Schneider) to discriminate between simultaneously provided clean paper strips and paper strips with oviposition-deterring larval tracks was studied after the ablation of different sense organs. Females oviposited similar numbers of eggs on paper strips with conspecific tracks and on clean paper strips only when deprived of both maxillary palpi. C. undecimnotata without maxillary palpi also did not differentiate between clean paper strips and paper strips with tracks of the coccinellid Leis dimidiata (F.). If both antennae and one maxillary palpus were simultaneously ablated, females of both species laid significantly more eggs on clean than contaminated paper strips. The results of this study indicate that females use contact chemoreceptors on maxillary palpi exclusively to detect oviposition deterring tracks of conspecific larvae.Intact females of C. limbifer laid significantly larger batches of eggs on paper strips with conspecific larval tracks, than on clean paper strips in blank test. In contrast, intact females of C. undecimnotata laid significantly smaller batches on paper strips with conspecific tracks than on clean paper strips in blank test. This is the first evidence of an opposite effect of conspecific oviposition deterring larval tracks on egg clustering in aphidophagous coccinellids.

N2  - To determine if small-scale resource partitioning aids coexistence in fungal breeding Diptera we investigated the avoidance of interspecific larval competition by micro-resource partitioning of the host substrate in several species of Drosophila ovipositing on fungal fruiting bodies. No avoidance was detected and oviposition patterns were unaffected by the presence of allospecifics. There was a general tendency for all species to oviposit preferentially on the cap but no significant differences between species. Egg distribution was not strongly related to the sporophore’s resistance to penetration measured by penetrometer and was also uncorrelated with ovipositor structure even though species had concordant suites of ovipositor characteristics with apparent specialists typified by hard and sharp ovipositors. We discuss the significance to species coexistence of the absence of micro-resource partitioning of the host.

N2  - Structural features of larvae and pupae of Prostomis mandibularis are described in detail. Larval features are discussed with respect to their functional and phylogenetic significance. The distinct asymmetry of the larval head, absence of stemmata, presence of a sensorial field on antennomere III, and elongated and broadened mandibles of pupae and adults are autapomorphies of Prostomidae. The placement of Prostomis within Tenebrionoidea is suggested by the posteriorly diverging gula with well developed gular ridges and the anterior position of the posterior tentorial arms. Affinities of Prostomidae with the pythid-pyrochroid-lineage is supported by the pad-like structure of the maxillary articulatory area, the abdominal tergite IX extending to the ventral side of the segment, and the strongly pronounced prognathous condition. Presence of a distinct molar tooth is a derived feature shared by Prostomidae, Pythidae, Pyrochroidae, Inopeplidae and Othniidae. A thorax narrower than the head and the abdomen, and a plate-like abdominal segment IX, which articulates with segment VIII, are possible synapomorphies of Prostomidae, Boridae, Mycteridae and Pyrochroidae. The strongly flattened, prognathous head and the strongly flattened body of larvae of Prostomidae are correlated with their habits of boring in wood of decaying logs.

N2  - The taxonomy of European Eristalinus syrphid flies is reviewed. New data on their life histories, biological notes and a key to species using pupal characters are provided. The larvae and puparia of Eristalinus taeniops (Wiedemann, 1818) and Eristalinus megacephalus (Rossi, 1794) are described for the first time, including new morphological characters of the thoracic respiratory process of all species. The morphology of the male genitalia of E. megacephalus is described and compared with that of E. taeniops.The results of our morphological studies of the male genitalia and molecular data (mitochondrial COI and nuclear 28S rDNA) do not support the traditional adult classification based on the patterning on the eyes (fasciate vs punctate). We present a phylogeny of the species based on molecular data. The molecular and morphological data indicate that the relationship between some species with punctate eyes and those with fasciate eyes may be closer than with other species with punctate eyes. Moreover the results of the molecular studies support two clades, which does not accord with the traditional arrangement of this group of Syrphidae.Accordingly we propose that the characters of male genitalia stated by Kanervo in 1938 (but subsequently largely ignored) for arranging the European species of the Eristalinus-Eristalodes-Lathyrophthalmus complex, are suitable for classifying these species.

Morphologically intermediate specimens of presumably hybrid origin were noticed in 63 (35.79%) samples, comprising 12.67% of all apterous and 4.87% of all alate viviparae studied. 31 sample originating from 11 countries had 50% or more intermediate specimens of one or both morphs.

For the first time, the diagnostic characters of deutonymphs of the species T. baloghi, T. minima, T. minimasimilis, T. mystacinus and T. splendida are figured. Ten species found in Slovakia are redescribed (T. aegrota, T. baloghi, T. hirschmanni, T. irenae, T. lamda, T. minima, T. minimasimilis, T. mystacinus, T. pauperior and T. splendida) and characterised by their external morphology, geographic distribution and ecological requirements in terms of habitat preference, affinity to merocoenoses and vertical distribution. The zoogeographic origin of Trachytes is analysed. Most species are found only in woodlands and have not been recorded in the distribution area of the Pannonian flora in Central Europe (except for T. aegrota and T. baloghi). Short taxonomic remarks are given for the species of dubious taxonomic status or whose occurrence is not reliably known.

N2  - 1) Alloxystinae are major secondary parasitoids of aphids, important in both their ecology and pest management. 2) Two radically differing views of alloxystine taxonomy exist in the literature, in one of which the group is very diverse, in the other it consists of a few variable species. 3) We sequenced a variable nuclear gene region (ITS2) for 28 specimens of a morphologically clearly defined group which, in one view belong to a single species and in the other to four species. We find that the four putative species each carry a different unique allele with no intraspecific variation. We show that the probability of the observed distribution of alleles under the assumption of a single interbreeding population is very small and we reject the view that all specimens belong to a single biological species. 4) We discuss the implications of our results for aphid - parasitoid community ecology and the biological control of aphids with parasitoids.

N2  - An inbred strain of a newly isolated spontaneous albino mutant of Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk.) was examined for the presence of the neuropeptide [His7]-corazonin by immunocytochemical and mass spectrometric methods. It was concluded that this peptide is definitely present in a limited number of neurosecretory cells in the pars lateralis as well as in the corpora cardiaca (CC). Injection of either synthetic [His7]-corazonin or of extracts of CC of the normal coloured phenotype of S. gregaria failed to induce darkening of the cuticle, while albino Locusta migratoria, used as a positive control, turned dark. The conclusion is that the cause of albinism in the new S. gregaria albino is probably due to a defect in the receptor system for [His7]-corazonin or in the biosynthetic pathway of melanin.

N2  - Many species of chironomids undergo their immature development in habitats that rapidly change in suitability, such as rain pools, phytotelmata, freshly filled ponds or soil layers that seasonally dry out. Strategies for the utilization of these habitats can be divided into two groups: i) physiological or behavioral adaptations of larvae, which enable them to survive unsuitable conditions (in situ resistance) or ii) repeated recolonization of temporarily suitable habitats. In situ resistance, includes desiccation or frost resistance, often in combination with cocoon building and migration of larvae into the sediment. Generally, the species that use the recolonization strategy tend to be better at migration and have a higher fertility and shorter development. Recolonization may include only temporary habitats or temporary habitats and some more stable habitats as well.

N2  - By means of a tracer assay using a labeled synthetic angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) substrate hippurylglycylglycine, we have detected high ACE activity in the testes of the African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. Lower, but significant, ACE activity was observed in midgut and hemolymph. In a two-step purification procedure involving anion exchange and gel permeation chromatography, we have purified LomACE from the locust testes. The enzyme of approximately 80 kDa shows substantial amino-acid sequence homology with ACE from both vertebrate and invertebrate origin. The ACE identity of the purified enzyme was further confirmed by cDNA cloning of the Locusta ACE fragment, which, after in silico translation, revealed a mature protein of 623 amino acids with a large structural similarity to other known ACE proteins.

N2  - We studied visual orientation and perching behaviour of a territorial libellulid dragonfly species, Libellula quadrimaculata. The studies were performed during sunny, cloudless conditions at a pond in southern Styria, Austria, from May to July of 2001 and 2002. Individual males were observed for periods of 3 to 4 weeks. We measured dragonfly’s horizontal orientation relative to the solar azimuth, and vertical orientation relative to the solar altitude. The measurements indicated that the males had a favourable view of the sky during perching. In addition, the relative amounts of ultraviolet (UV) and blue-violet radiation in scattered light (not direct sunlight) were calculated for the whole sky and for the section of the sky viewed by the fovea. Our results show that the dorsal fovea is directed preferentially toward a section of the sky away from the sun, with less radiation but a higher UV and blue-violet saturation.The present findings fit in well with the hypothesis, based on optical and physiological data, that the fovea, which is sensitive only to blue and UV radiation, is optimally suited to the detection of small, rapidly flying insects against the blue sky. The findings supply the first behavioural correlates of this foveal specialisation.

N2  - Effects of chilling on dispersal characteristics of adults of the water strider, Aquarius paludum were studied in the laboratory. The condition of flight muscles was monitored during overwintering under natural conditions in Kochi (33°N), Japan. For diapause adults kept under 12h light-12h dark (12L : 12D), chilling at 7°C for 48h from the 70th day after emergence caused lower Supercooling Point (SCP) and promoted higher flight propensity than among gerrids not exposed to chilling. For reproductive adults kept under 15.5L : 8.5D, 91.3% of 34 adults retained well-developed flight muscles 1 week after the chilling (49 days after emergence), whereas 67.6% of 49 adults which had not been exposed to 7°C histolysed their flight muscles. According to diapause development, part of the adults which had well developed flight muscles histolysed them during December to February. Chilling in fall might trigger dispersal to overwintering sites by diapause adults and, that in spring could inhibit histolysis of flight muscles by overwintered reproductive adults.

N2  - Sexual dimorphisms in adult size (SSD) and development time (SDTD) occur in many groups of organisms. In insects, some of the best examples occur in parasitoid wasps where most studies report that females are larger than males but take longer to develop. Sex-specific differences in the effects of size on reproductive success is generally regarded as the main factor responsible for SSD in parasitoids. Most studies also assume that development time must be extended in order to achieve larger size. Here, SSD and SDTD were compared in the solitary endoparasitoid, Microplitis mediator that develops in larvae of the moth Pseudoplusia includens. The relationship between male and female body size and development time were isometric in M. mediator, but contradict most predictions of parasitoid development models. Across first to fourth instars at parasitism, male wasps were consistently larger than females but completed their development significantly faster. The longer development time in female wasps was due primarily to an extended pupal phase, whereas the duration of larval development did not vary significantly with offspring sex. Secondary sex ratios (percentage male) also did not vary with host instar. We conclude that SSD in M. mediator is not only a function of extended development time, but also because of several possible factors: (i) selection favours an increase in male size (relative to female size); (ii) female size is constrained because of predation risk, (iii) as a cost of reducing the cost of inbreeding or (iv) constraints on egg maturation rate. We argue that failure to look carefully at how parasitoids grow can lead to incorrect conclusions about the basis or significance of SSD.

N2  - The nymphs of spittlebugs (Hemiptera, Cercopidae) are xylem-feeders and live on herbs, grasses or woody plants within their self-produced spittle masses. Nymphs of the spittlebug Neophilaenus albipennis live aggregated in these spittle masses on their host plant Brachypodium pinnatum, a common grass in dry grassland. The objective of this study was to estimate nymphal mortality rates and to examine what role aggregation and vegetation structure play in the mortality of the nymphs. The aggregation and mortality were measured using two different methods, direct monitoring and caging of nymphs. The nymphs passively aggregated with up to 4 nymphs per spittle and aggregation decreased with instar. The aggregation of the nymphs resulted in a reduced mortality in all instars. Although it has already been argued that aggregation may be an advantage, this study is the first direct evidence (i.e. direct measurement of single individuals) for the benefit of aggregation to individual spittlebug nymphs. Despite a clumped distribution of N. albipennis nymphs in tall vegetation, nymphal mortality was not correlated with vegetation height.

N2  - The influence of cucumber offered as a host plant either alone or with Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was studied on the various life table and biological characteristics of the predatory bug Macrolophus pygmaeus Rambur (Hemiptera: Miridae). The nymphal development was studied at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35°C while adult performance was assessed at 15, 20, 25 and 30°C, using a 16L : 8D photoperiod and 65 ± 5% r.h. Nymphs completed their development at all temperatures except at 35°C. Nymphal development took significantly longer time in the absence than in the presence of prey at 20 and 25°C, but the reverse was true at 15°C. Nymphal mortality was highest at 15°C in the presence of prey and it was mainly recorded at the first and second stages. Females oviposited a small number of eggs at all temperatures but not at 30°C in the absence of prey. The average number of eggs per female was almost similar with or without prey, being highest at 20°C, and adult longevity was highest at 15°C. The results concerning population parameters clearly showed that cucumber with or without prey can not support a population increase of M. pygmaeus. However, it seems that A. gossypii on cucumber inhibits development of M. pygmaeus more than when this aphid species is not present. This adverse effect on this host plant-prey system possibly results from the particular aphid genotype on cucumber, leading to high nymphal mortality, reduced fecundity and short adult life-span of M. pygmaeus.

N2  - Development rates of the eggs of 9 species, larvae of 6 species and pupae of 6 species of the genus Amara (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were recorded at five constant temperatures between 17 and 28°C, and thermal constants for each development stage calculated. The lower development threshold varied between 9.2–13.5°C for different stages and species. Rate isomorphy, which implies the existence of a common temperature threshold for all development stages, was demonstrated in 5 species. The sum of effective temperatures differed between stages. On average the egg stage took 18%, the first larval instar 13%, second instar 13%, third instar 35% and pupa 21% of the total development time. A poor diet increased the SET of the larvae. The results are compared with published data on Carabidae.

Barometric pressure had a significant effect on Response Index values (used as a measure of odor discrimination); odor discrimination of hexane-extracted McIntosh fruit volatiles was high when barometric pressure was high. Barometric pressure also had a significant effect on oviposition as females oviposited more during periods of low barometric pressure on a favored host fruit (wild plum). Observed feeding activity of females was not influenced by barometric pressure.

Aphid population dynamics were recorded throughout the growing season and analysis of the chemical composition of spring wheat leaves was conducted at the same time. Results showed that: (1) Aphid populations increased with raised atmospheric CO2 concentrations. (2) The aphid populations showed different responses to different CO2 concentrations. The population size, population growth rate and population density found under the 350 ppm CO2 treatment was far less than those recorded under the 550 and 700 ppm CO2 treatments. The population size, population growth rate and population density recorded under the 700 ppm CO2 treatment was slightly higher than those recorded under the 550 ppm CO2 treatment. (3) The effect of CO2 concentration on the aphid population was correlated with soil water level. The highest aphid population size was achieved under the 60% soil water treatment. (4) Atmospheric CO2 and soil moisture had significant effects on the chemical composition of the wheat leaves. (5) Aphid population size correlated positively with the concentration of leaf water content, soluble proteins, soluble carbohydrates and starch, while correlating negatively with the concentration of DIMBOA and tannin.

N2  - The consumption and preferences of polyphagous ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) for the seeds of herbaceous plants was determined. The seeds were stuck into plasticine in small tin trays and exposed to beetle predation on surface of the ground. In the laboratory the effect of carabid (species, satiation) and seed (species, size) on the intensity of seed predation was investigated. The consumption of the generally preferred Cirsium arvense seed by 23 species of common carabids increased with body size. Seed of Capsella bursa-pastoris was preferred by small carabids and their consumption rates were not related to their size. The average daily consumption of all the carabid species tested (0.33 mg seeds . mg body mass–1 . day–1) was essentially the same for both kinds of seed. Because of satiation the consumption of seed of C. arvense provided ad libitum to Pseudoophonus rufipes decreased over a period of 9 days to 1/3–1/4 of the initial consumption rate. Preferences of P. rufipes (body mass 29.6 mg) and Harpalus affinis (13.4 mg) for the seeds of 64 species of herbaceous plants were determined. The small H. affinis preferred smaller seed than the large P. rufipes. Predation of seed present on the ground in the field was studied in 1999–2000, at Praha-Ruzyne (50°06´ N 14°16´E). Seeds were placed in stands of different crops as in the laboratory experiments and vertebrate predation was excluded by wire mesh cages. Pitfall traps placed near the cages revealed that carabids were the only seed predators active in the area. Rates of removal of seed of 6 weed species varied with crop, season, seed and site. Average rate of removal in June-August was 2.5 seeds.day–1.tray–1 and was smaller before and after this period. The rates of removal increased with increasing activity density of the carabids and paucity of seed from naturally occurring weeds, which may have satiated the carabids. In stands of winter wheat, millet and soybeans there were significant differences in the rates of removal of the seed of 43 herbaceous species. The field preferences were correlated with those established in the laboratory. Predation of seed on the ground in arable fields can be as high as 1000 seeds.m–2.day–1 and may selectively influence the quantity of seed of particular herb species that enters the soil seed bank. Seed predation thus may be an effective component of weed control on arable land, particularly at low weed densities.

N2  - During a survey of 23 wet heathland sites in Flanders (north Belgium) in 1999 and 2000, using both manual nest searching and pitfall traps as sampling techniques, we found 28 ant species. One species (Myrmica lonae) was new to the Belgian fauna and several rare species were encountered. Three ecological groups could be distinguished based on soil preference: the first group of species was characteristic of sandy soil, the second contained species that were more numerous on peat soil (with Sphagnum spp.), and the third group of species had no soil preference. Ant nest numbers increased strongly between 1999 and 2000, especially on the plots that were inundated during the winter of 1999–2000, but the number of ant species did not differ significantly between years. Ant nest density showed an optimum at a Purple Moor-grass (Molinia caerulea) cover of about 45%; the number of species did not show such an optimum. Pitfall traps yielded more species than manual nest searching; in particular temporary social parasites, species with a large foraging range and winged females from the surrounding habitats were missed by the latter technique. Finally, we give some recommendations for the conservation of, and suitable management measures for, ants on wet heathland.

N2  - 1. The Heteroptera, principally mirids, collected in a light-trap run on a field margin at Rothamsted Experimental Station for various periods between 1933 and 2000, have been identified, and the catches analysed to show the extent of change and stability in the community.2. Trap catch, both in terms of individuals and species, was correlated with maximum daily temperature.3. α-diversity showed a U-shaped curve over the period. The dip may have been associated with pesticide use, although a lack of days with high maximum temperatures cannot be ruled out.4. By the late 1990s, α-diversity had again reached a peak (Fisher’s = 11), comparable to that in the 1930s.5. However, the change in the composition of the community over the whole period (β-diversity) was significant, the index of difference being 0.66 on a scale where 0 is no change in composition or relative abundance and 1 no species in common.6. The value of β-diversity was highest in the water bugs, which disappeared altogether. Categorising the others by host plant type, the greatest change over time was in those associated with perennial herbs. There were decreasing differences in tree-dwellers and grassland species respectively, and the least change was in the community associated with annual plants (arable weeds).7. Changes in the abundance of Heteroptera since 1933 follow closely those of the macrolepidoptera from the same samples. However changes in diversity show very different patterns, with moth diversity continuing to decline since 1960 in contrast to the increases apparent from the Heteroptera data.

N2  - The larvae of Lype phaeopa (Stephens, 1836) are found on dead wood substrates in streams and lakes. Gut content analyses, scanning electron microscopy of larval mouthparts, and gallery structure revealed characteristics of this habitat preference. The guts of the larvae contained mainly wood fragments whereas other food items (detritus, algae, fungi, inorganic particles) were much rarer. The suitability of the mouthparts to scrape wood surfaces, and the adaptative elongation of the silk-secreting spinneret, which facilitates the construction of retreats consisting of a tunnel-like silken net incorporating mainly wood fragments, are discussed. Retreat-construction under laboratory conditions indicated that larvae exploit new feeding areas by steadily extending their galleries. Tips of the maxillary palps bear five sensilla styloconica and five sensilla basiconica, almost all bearing an apical pore. Three sensilla styloconica, two with an apical peg, and two small inconspicious sensilla basiconica are located on the galea. Possible function of these sensilla is discussed on the basis of studies on the closely related sister-group of Lepidoptera.

N2  - Sensillar structures of the antennal pedicel are investigated in Reduviidae and Pachynomidae. The cave organ, a presumably chemoreceptive structure, previously reported only for haematophagous Triatominae, is described here also for representatives of Peiratinae, Reduviinae and Stenopodainae. The systematic implication of the occurrence of this sensillar structure is discussed. Further, four sclerites located in the membrane between pedicel and preflagelloid are described and used as landmarks for the recognition of individual trichobothria in Reduviidae and Pachynomidae. Characters of the trichobothrial socket are studied and discussed systematically. Homology of the distalmost trichobothrium of Reduviidae with the single trichobothrium in Pachynomidae is proposed. This hypothesis is based on the structure of the cuticle surrounding the trichobothria and on the trichobothrial position relative to the four sclerites of the pedicello-flagellar articulation. The single trichobothrium present in most nymphs corresponds to the distalmost trichobothrium in adult Reduviidae in position and structural detail. A reasonable hypotheses on the homology of individual trichobothria of the proximal row or field seen in most Reduviidae can so far only be formulated for Peiratinae.

Phylogenetic relationships with the extinct order Caloneurodea, related to the Orthoptera (crickets, grasshoppers), are assumed. This assumption suggests an occurrence of the Permostridulidae at least since the Upper Carboniferous. The most prominent feature of the wing venation is a stridulatory apparatus, nonhomologous with those previously known in "panorthopterid” lineages. This is the oldest recorded sound-producing device of an animal.

N2  - The first part of a revision of the European species of the genus Rhabdomastix Skuse, 1890 is presented. The history of taxonomic research on Rhabdomastix is reviewed, relationships of the genus are discussed, and the subgeneric classification outlined and re-assessed. A new subgenus, Lurdia subgen. n., is established for species centred around R. lurida (Loew, 1873), and Palaeogonomyia Meunier, 1899 and Sacandaga Alexander, 1911, previously considered subgenera, are synonymized with Rhabdomastix. A revision of the European species of Lurdia subgen. n. is presented. Two species are redescribed, Rhabdomastix (Lurdia) lurida (Loew, 1873) and R. (L.) inclinata Edwards, 1938, and the lectotype of the former is designated. Descriptions are provided of seven species, viz. R. (L.) mendli sp. n. (Switzerland, Germany, Italy), R. (L.) sublurida sp. n. (Czech Republic, Slovakia), R. (L.) furva sp. n. (Slovakia), R. (L.) loewi sp. n. (Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy), R. (L.) robusta sp. n. (Czech Republic, Slovakia), R. (L.) falcata sp. n. (Switzerland, Germany, Bulgaria) and R. (L.) tatrica sp. n. (Slovakia). Male and female terminalia are illustrated for all the species (except female falcata), and a key to species is appended.

N2  - The Japanese species of Asteiidae are revised. Six species of Asteia Meigen, 1830, are recorded here in addition to Astiosoma okinawae Sabrosky, 1957, hitherto recorded from Japan. Among them, Asteia gemina, A. longistylus, A. lunaris, and A. nigrigena are described as new to science. Asteia angustipennis Duda, 1934, and A. megalophthalma Duda, 1927, are recorded from Japan for the first time. There are conspicuous morphological differences in the male and female genitalia of the seven species of Asteia. It is suggested that Asteia angustipennis, A. concinna, and A. gemina are very closely related and may be reproductively isolated because of their body markings and male genitalia. These species are assigned to the concinna group of Asteia, newly designated in this study. A key to Japanese species and distribution maps are provided.

N2  - Ornithologists in Finland recorded the autumn migration of the Red Admiral butterfly, Vanessa atalanta (L.). In the best year, 1998, 1240 migrants were counted from a bird tower in September. That is, half a million butterflies migrated over a 100-km front. The butterflies were flying above forests riding on cool northerly winds. Radar indicated that a large proportion migrated at high elevations outside the visible range. These records help to resolve an "evolutionary puzzle” of why migrant butterflies and moths travel to northern latitudes when their offspring have limited possibilities of returning south. Until now, the only butterfly for which a high-elevation return migration on northerly winds is known is the American Monarch Danaus plexippus (L.).

N2  - In the years 1998–2000, parasitization of the pupae of various ladybird species by scuttle flies of the genus Phalacrotophora was studied in central Poland. Altogether, 12 ladybird species were found to be parasitized by these flies, and one of them, Anatis ocellata (L.), proved to be a host of P. beuki Disney, a species whose biology had not previously been described. Our studies showed that P. beuki can limit the numbers of A. ocellata. In its typical habitat, i.e. Scots pine forests, 35–40% of this ladybird were parasitized by P. beuki. In other habitats, however, where A. ocellata occurred sporadically, P. beuki was not recorded from A. ocellata or other ladybird pupae. P. beuki was described from a single female collected in Holland. The present paper describes the hitherto unknown male, which is very similar to the males of P. berolinensis Schmitz and P. delageae Disney. The feature that reliably separates the males of these three species (a detail of the hypopygium) is described. This feature enabled the recognition in the collection of the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology of a male of P. beuki from Germany, previously assigned to P. berolinensis.

N2  - Colletes anchusae Noskiewicz, 1924 and C. wolfi Kuhlmann, 1999 (Colletidae) are closely related bee species with vicariant distributions, the former occurring in east and southeast Europe and Turkey, the latter restricted to the Italian peninsula. Microscopical analysis of scopal pollen revealed that in Europe both species are monolectic collecting pollen exclusively from flowers of Cynoglottis barrelieri (All.) Vural & Kit Tan (Boraginaceae). In Turkey, C. anchusae possibly visits also Cynoglottis chetikiana Vural & Kit Tan. The distributions of the two bee species and of Cynoglottis coincide. The females of both Colletes species are equipped with stout, curved bristles on their foretarsi used for scraping pollen out of the narrow flower tube of Cynoglottis. Compared to other European species of Colletes the foretarsi of C. anchusae and C. wolfi are shortened, presumably an adaptation to the short corolla tube of their host plant.

N2  - The complete nucleotide sequence and the exon-intron structure of the luciferase gene of the firefly, Luciola lateralis (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) is described. The luciferase gene of the L. lateralis firefly spans 1,971 bp and consists of six introns and seven exons coding for 548 amino acid residues. From samples collected at Boun and Muju, Korea, three isoforms, with identical exon-intron structure, named BU, MJ1 and MJ2, respectively, were obtained. Although the amino acid sequences of MJ1 and MJ2 were identical to those of known luciferase genes of Korean origin, the BU type was novel, differing from each of the MJ1 and MJ2 types by one amino acid. The luciferase sequences of the Korean samples, including those previously revealed, differed only by one - two amino acid residues, but differed by five - six amino acid residues from that of the luciferase gene recorded from specimens from Japan, which suggest genetic divergence has occurred in this species. Phylogenetic analyses using both amino acid and nucleotide sequences further showed that the luciferase gene of the Japanese L. lateralis firefly is genetically distinguishable from that of Korean L. lateralis, suggesting the presence of a genetic subdivision between the L. lateralis dwelling in the Korean Peninsula and Japanese Islands.

N2  - Tomicus piniperda is a pest in pine stands in Eurasia and is also found in the USA, where it has caused a decline in the abundance of pine since 1992. Knowledge of the genetic structure of pine shoot beetle populations is important for understanding their phylogeographic history and for quarantine control. In this study, European, Asian and American T. piniperda populations were analyzed by sequencing a region of the mitochondrial COI gene. Twenty-five haplotypes (HT) were detected and over 70% of these HT were found in individual areas, e.g. 5 HT in China, 5 HT in France and 3 HT in Spain. Nested clade analysis revealed that most European and the American population was in a clade containing 9 HT connected by one to two mutational steps. A second clade contained HT from France (2 HT), Spain (2 HT), Sweden (1 HT), Russia (1 HT) and China (5 HT). In this clade, one to 13 mutational steps and 13 missing or theoretical HT were detected. The third clade had 5 HT from France, Russia, Poland, Finland and Switzerland; 1 to 7 mutational steps and 5 missing or theoretical HT were detected. Although only a few significant relationships were found in the nested clade analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) T. piniperda is a polymorphic species with numerous HT throughout Europe, and HT are likely to exist regarding the missing or theoretical HT; (2) It is likely there were refugial areas in Southern Europe and Western Russia; (3) The Pyrenees formed a barrier to migration after the last ice age; (4) Chinese and European populations have been separated for at least 0.6 MYA.

N2  - Abnormal spermatogenesis in Pityogenes chalcographus (L.) and Ips typographus (L.) results in oversized spermatozoa in all the populations investigated. They can be identified by light microscopy and classified as 2n up to 16n polyploid. The percentage of polyploid sperm increases when allopatric parents are crossed: Parental populations with less than 1% polyploid, result in male F1 with more than 20% polyploid. Wild populations of P. chalcographus and I. typographus have very different percentages of polyploid sperm. Populations from allochthonous sites for the host tree, Picea abies (Karst.), are distinguished by higher rates of sperm polyploidy than those from autochthonous areas. Thus, it is assumed that polyploid sperm indicates populations originating from the mixing of partially incompatible beetles.

N2  - The aim of this study was to show that the kind of AKH-mobilized energy substrates in insects can be predicted on the basis of the results obtained with the application of heterologous, i.e. inter-species, AKHs. Four different AKHs, the Locmi-AKH-I inducing hyperlipaemia and hyperglycaemia in Locusta migratoria, Tenmo-HrTH inducing hyperglycaemia in Tenebrio molitor, and Pyrap-AKH and Peram-CAH-II inducing hyperlipaemia in Pyrrhocoris apterus were used, firstly in conspecific tests, secondly in all possible species-AKH combinations, and finally in individual applications on the test species, the cotton bug Dysdercus cingulatus. Since each of the AKHs induced hyperlipaemia in D. cingulatus adults, we predicted that lipids are the only energy substrates which are mobilized in this species by its native AKH. The accuracy of this prediction was subsequently confirmed by the structural identification of the native D. cingulatus AKH and conspecific application tests. The proposed methodical approach can serve as a suitable monitoring system for determination of the kind of energy substrates mobilized by native insect AKHs until the structure of the hormone is identified.

N2  - Our goal has been to determine the effect of the presence of aphids on voracity (measured as number of prey eaten and biomass consumed) of Coccinella septempunctata L. and Harmonia axyridis Pallas (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) feeding upon the oblique-banded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae). For each coccinellid predator, treatments using a single prey species, with either 30 first instar C. rosaceana or 100 third instars Aphis pomi DeGeer (Hemiptera: Aphididae), were compared with two-prey treatments in which the two prey species were present simultaneously. For both predators, the total number of prey killed (total prey species pooled) and the total biomass consumed were significantly higher when both prey were present than in single-prey treatments. The voracity of C. septempunctata on C. rosaceana larvae was not affected by adding A. pomi, whereas that of H. axyridis declined; the voracity of both predators on A. pomi increased when C. rosaceana larvae were added. The preference for the aphids over C. rosaceana was confirmed for both coccinellid species.

N2  - 1. A study was made by knockdown sampling and branch clipping of the arthropod fauna of two native oaks (Quercus petraea and Q. robur) and of two introduced species (Q. cerris and Q. ilex) in woods near Oxford, U.K., and of two native species (Q. ilex and Q. pubescens) in southern France. Sampling was undertaken for five years in England and four years in France. All the phytophagous species except Acarina and Cecidomyidae from the Oxford samples were identified to species. 2. In England a marked seasonal pattern was observed in all years: chewing insects peaked in May, followed sequentially by sucking species, leaf miners and gall formers. The May peak on the native trees is much larger in terms of individuals, and especially in biomass, than on the introduced species. This peak is well known to provide an important food source for several species of woodland bird. 3. Most phytophages were much less abundant on the introduced oaks than on the native species. This is probably due more to the features of the leaves, than to the introduced status per se. 4. The species richness of the fauna was estimated by three methods on the basis of the total projected number of species (Smax), and its specificity to oak by reference to the known host range as recorded in the standard reference works. 5. The species richness of Heteroptera and Coleoptera on the deciduous oaks in their natural habitats (Q. petraea and Q. robur in England, Q. pubescens in France) are similar. 6. The fauna of the evergreen Q. ilex has a similar species richness both in France, where it is native, and in England, where it is introduced and where its phytophage guild is smaller than that of the deciduous species. In England the extent of oak specificity on Q. ilex is less than that of the deciduous species. 7. In England the phytophage fauna of the deciduous and introduced Q. cerris has a species richness considerably greater than that found on Q. ilex, but somewhat less than that of the deciduous and native oaks. However, the specificity of this fauna to oaks was not significantly different to that of the fauna on the native oaks.

N2  - The Large Copper butterfly, Lycaena dispar, is extinct in Britain and rapidly declining in the rest of Europe, due predominantly to loss of its wetland habitats. In the Netherlands the sub-species L. d. batavus is at the edge of its range in Northern Europe and, as with most marginal butterflies, has more specialised food plant and habitat requirements than the core populations of L. d. rutilus. We investigate reasons for the relative specialisation of L. d. batavus on Rumex hydrolapathum in a fenland habitat when compared to the more widespread and common L. d. rutilus. Host-plant choice by ovipositing females and by larvae are measured as well as larval performance on alternative hosts. Laboratory experiments reveal that larvae are able to feed on other Rumex species without detriment to their overall survival and can utilise these alternative host plants at least as efficiently as their natural host plant. This suggests that plant chemistry is not responsible for their lack of utilisation in the wild. Under greenhouse conditions, females showed an equal willingness to oviposit on host and alternative Rumex, expressing no significant preference for any particular plant species. However, in field experiments using free-ranging females in a fenland habitat, eggs were laid only on R. hydrolapathum. Our interpretation is that there are no short distance cues discriminating between the three Rumex species but longer distance cues in the field situation may operate to maintain this host-plant specialisation. The selection pressure maintaining L. d. batavus as a specialist on R. hydrolapathum in a wetland may underlie its current rarity.

N2  - The Large Copper butterfly, Lycaena dispar batavus, is extinct in Britain and rapidly declining in Europe, due predominantly to loss of its wetland habitats. Northern populations have more specialised foodplant and habitat requirements than their more southerly counterparts and rely solely on Rumex hydrolapathum, the Great Water Dock, as their hostplants. Southern colonies use a greater range of Rumex. Previous work has shown that specialisation is not due to foodplant chemistry and in this paper we investigate the ability of different Rumex species to support the larval stages of L. d. batavus in a natural environment. Comparisons were also made between a captive colony at Woodwalton Fen, Cambridgeshire, UK and native larvae at De Weerribben, Netherlands. Field experiments using a captive colony revealed that other Rumex hosts can successfully support larvae throughout each of their larval stages in wet grassland and fenland habitats with no significant differences in survival rates compared with their natural hostplant R. hydrolapathum. An overwintering experiment using a native wild population of both butterfly and Rumex species in De Weerribben found 25% of larvae survived on the natural hostplant R. hydrolapathum and no survivors on alternative Rumex hosts. It is suggested that R. crispus and R. obtusifolius growing in their natural habitat may harbour significant competitors to L. d. batavus leading to its specialisation on R. hydrolapathum in fenland habitats.

N2  - Studies on nocturnal Lepidoptera were carried out on the Laukėnai raised bog and the adjacent wet forest in 2001. Species composition and abundance were evaluated and compared. The species richness was much higher in the forest than at the bog. The core of each lepidopteran community was composed of 22 species with an abundance of higher than 1.0% of the total catch. Tyrphophilous Hypenodes humidalis (22.0% of all individuals) and Nola aerugula (13.0%) were the dominant species in the raised bog community, while tyrphoneutral Pelosia muscerda (13.6%) and Eilema griseola (8.3%) were the most abundant species at the forest site. Five tyrphobiotic and nine tyrphophilous species made up 43.4% of the total catch on the bog, and three and seven species, respectively, at the forest site, where they made up 9.2% of all individuals. 59% of lepidopteran species recorded on the bog and 36% at the forest site were represented by less than five individuals. The species compositions of these communities showed a weak similarity. Habitat preferences of the tyrphobiontic and tyrphophilous species and dispersal of some of the species between the habitats are discussed.

N2  - A general model of the Dolichopoda cave cricket life cycle was produced using RAMAS/stage simulations based on the Beverton & Holt recruitment function. The model indicates the main population parameters responsible for life cycle adjustments to ecologically different cave habitats. The lack of a uniform rate of oviposition throughout adult life, combined with egg and nymphal diapause, results in regular population growth characterized by adults emerging every two years and cohorts overlapping every other year. This pattern is common in populations living in artificial caves where the scarcity of food is likely to favour individuals that synchronise their activity with the seasonal variations in the epigean habitat. In contrast, a uniform rate of oviposition throughout adult life and no egg or nymphal diapause results in a continuous reproductive activity, and the occurrence of adults all the year round. In this case, it was not possible to distinguish between cohorts. This pattern is well represented in populations inhabiting natural caves with stable food resources. The availability of data for a population that resulted from an experimental colonization allowed us to test this model.

N2  - The comparative biology of the solitary endoparasitoid Meteorus gyrator (Thun.) was investigated in five noctuid pest species. Meteorus gyrator parasitized all larval stages of the noctuid pests Lacanobia oleracea, Mamestra brassicae, Spodoptera exigua, Spodoptera littoralis and Chrysodeixis chalcites. When female parasitoids were offered host larvae of all developmental stages, host larvae in their third stadium were parasitized most frequently in all species. When the parasitoid was offered a choice of third stadium larvae from each of the five lepidopteran host species, L. oleracea was the most frequently parasitized, followed by M. brassicae. The growth of L. oleracea and M. brassicae was markedly reduced when larvae were parasitized by M. gyrator, with the effect of parasitism on the remaining species being much less pronounced. In excess of 94% of parasitized hosts gave rise to live wasps in L. oleracea, whilst in M. brassicae only 52% of parasitized hosts gave rise to a live wasp, the remainder dying (44.6%) or pupating (3.1%). The larval development of the parasitoid was also strongly influenced by the host species. Thus, the development (egg to cocoon) of female wasps was most rapid in C. chalcites (9.7 ± 0.09 days), and longest in M. brassicae (17.2 ± 1.08 days). The cocoon weight of wasps was also significantly affected by host species, with the heaviest female cocoons being derived from C. chalcites (10.4 ± 0.16 mg) and the lightest female cocoons being derived from M. brassicae (7.0 ± 0.14 mg). In all cases, the development times and cocoon weights of male parasitoids were less than those of female wasps.

N2  - Life-history parameters (juvenile development time, adult longevity, host instar preference and rate of parasitism) of four parasitoids of Bemisia argentifolii (two strains of Encarsia formosa (D and B), Eretmocerus eremicus and Eretmocerus mundus) were studied in the laboratory. At 15°C juvenile development time was the shortest for E. formosa B (48 days), longest for E. eremicus (79.3 days) and intermediate for E. formosa D (62.8 days) and E. mundus (64 days) at 15°C. With increase in temperature, development time decreased to around 14 days for all species/strains at 32°C. The lower developmental threshold for development was 11.5, 8.1, 13.0 and 11.5°C for E. formosa D, E. formosa B, E. eremicus and E. mundus, respectively. E. formosa D and B, and E. mundus all appeared to prefer to parasitize 3rd instar nymphs. The presence of hosts shortened adult longevity in most of the parasitoids, with the exception of E. formosa B, which lived longer than other species/strains irrespective of the presence of hosts. At 15°C daily parasitism was very low by all parasitoids. The two Encarsia strains had a constant, but low rate of reproduction during adult life, while the two Eretmocerus species had a very high rate of reproduction when one-day old, which then decreased very quickly. Lifetime fecundity, estimated using a non-linear model, indicated that it was higher for the two Encarsia strains than for the Eretmocerus species. Life history parameters reported in the literature for the four parasitoids are reviewed and compared with our results. Finally, the potential value for the biological control of whiteflies on greenhouse crops of parasitoids having either a high reproductive rate over a short period (Eretmocerus spp.) or a low rate of reproduction over a long period (Encarsia spp.) is discussed.

The shortest tree found using Winclada with Nona exhibits the following topology: Orthoneoptera + (Blattoneoptera + (Hemineoptera + Endoneoptera: (Hymenoptera + ((Neuropterida + Mecopterida) + (Coleoptera + Strepsiptera))))). Homologization of the hind wing venation in Coleoptera is reviewed and updated, and comments are made concerning recent works on wing folding. Recent phylogenetic schemes proposed for the orders of Endoneoptera and suborders of Coleoptera are reviewed and their supporting evidence critically examined. The special role and influence of the hind wing anojugal lobe on the diversification of Neoptera and Endoneoptera is discussed. A scenario is proposed for the origin and evolution of the insect hind wing.

N2  - The most recent representative of the semi-aquatic insect family Chresmodidae is described from the Lebanese Cenomanian marine lithographic limestone. Its highly specialized legs, with a high number of tarsomeres, never observed in other orders of insects, were probably adapted for water surface skating. We hypothesize the occurrence of a unique, extraordinary "antenna” mutation affecting the distal part of the legs of the Chresmodidae, maybe homeotic or affecting some genes that participate in the leg development and segmentation. The Chresmodidae had a serrate ovipositor adapted to endophytic egg laying in floating or aquatic plants. They were probably predaceous on nektonic small animals. As the Chresmodidae and the aquatic water skaters of the bug families Veliidae and Gerridae were contemporaneous during at least the Lower Cretaceous, these insects probably did not cause the extinction of this curious group.

N2  - The frontal gland as a sac-like organ in Prorhinotermes simplex is present only in presoldiers, soldiers, and imagoes, but exists also in nymph-soldier intercastes. The secretory epithelium consists of a single type of secretory cells adhering directly to the cuticular intima. Secretory vacuoles originate in electron dense vesicles, which are transformed into large electron lucent vacuoles. Intermediate vacuoles frequently contain lipid droplets. The frontal gland cells in presoldiers reveal modifications connected with the production of a new cuticle; the new cuticle is thin and compact, whereas the old one is thick, porous, and wrinkled. None of these cuticles is present in soldiers (sic!). In soldiers, the cuticular intima is of endocuticular origin and is formed by dispersed dense material; the apical parts of secretory cells are formed by numerous irregular finger-like projections, true microvilli are completely lacking. In imagoes, the cuticle is composed of an epicuticle, a layer of epicuticular filaments, and one more basal layer; sexual differences were not observed. In nymph-soldier intercastes, the structure of the gland differs in the head and in the metathorax; the head part of the gland resembles the imaginal gland whereas the thoracic part resembles more that of the soldier; the development of secretory vacuoles stops at the stage of presence of lipid droplets. E-1-nitropentadecene was found in the highest amount in soldiers (comparable to P. inopinatus soldiers), in moderate amount in imagoes, and it is missing in both presoldiers and intercastes.

N2  - The external morphology and chaetotaxy of the larvae of Heterogynidae (Lepidoptera) are described in order to provide information of potential phylogenetic value for the reconstruction of the systematic relationships within the Zygaenoidea. The most outstanding characteristics of heterogynid larvae are their modified habitus during diapause, the presence of an epipharyngeal lamella, the shape of the prothoracic shield, the presence in the first instar of an organ of unknown function on the middorsum of the mesothorax ("Chapman’s organ”), the absence of V2, V3 and Va on the head, the absence of V1 on the prothorax and the presence of two primary setae on the inner side of the proleg, the last trait representing an autapomorphy of the family. A number of possible synapomorphies with the Zygaenidae (e.g. presence of cuticular cavities) suggest a close relationship between these two families, but other larval and adult traits are shared only with the "Phaudinae” and limacodid-group families of the Zygaenoidea (viz. absence of V1 on the prothorax with the "Phaudinae”, reduced proboscis and absence of ocelli with them all). Nevertheless, a lack of knowledge of the preimaginal instars of species from some zygaenoid families, and of the homology and polarity of given characters of groups within and outside the Zygaenoidea, hamper a thorough comparison of larvae.

N2  - Horse chestnut trees in many regions of Europe have suffered from epidemic infestations of C. ohridella for more than ten years. There has been no obvious decrease in the infestation level anywhere on the continent. One reason is, that the native natural enemies have not been able to control mass outbreaks of the leafminer. Parasitoid Hymenoptera have very little impact on the first generation of the moth in early summer, regardless of the number of parasitoids that overwintered in horse chestnut leaves. This study revealed that there is a considerable time lag between the emergence of the parasitoids from the leaflitter in spring and the appearance of suitable host instars in early summer. The poor control of C. ohridella by natural enemies may partly be due to the poor synchronisation between the life cycles of the introduced host and native parasitoid wasps.

N2  - The aphids Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) (greenbug) and Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) (Russian wheat aphid, RWA) were collected from several localities in Argentina and Southern Chile. Clones were established from aphids collected at each location. The host preferences were studied in free choice tests. Biotypes were characterized on the basis of aphid antibiosis and host plant tolerance. The production of sexuals was assessed under natural conditions, from March to November in 1997-2001, at La Plata (34°55´ S, 57°57´ W). The greenbug distribution ranged from 24°40´ to 43°28´ S, and was bounded between isothermals 18–20°C and 8–10°C, and isohyets 400–600 mm and greater than 1200 mm. The aphids at all localities were collected from a wide range of cultivated and wild hosts. The biotypes in ten out of thirty-four populations were identified. One population was obligatorily parthenogenetic, the remainder cyclically parthenogenetic. No correlation was found between the region they came from and the period required for the induction of sexuals. RWA was found between 26°50´ and 43°28´S, bounded by the isothermals 20–22°C and 8–10°C, and isohyets 400–600 mm and 2000 mm. In Chile, this aphid was only found in Osorno County, which lies on isothermal 8–10°C and is bounded by the isohyets 1000 mm and 2000 mm. Only a few RWA genotypes (clones) produced sexuals irrespective of the host they were collected from, period of the year, region, current host, or the day length and average temperature of the rearing conditions. For the first time, RWA was found infesting cultivated as well as wild oats in South America. At low latitudes, populations of both aphid species were found only infesting wild Sorghum halepensis (L).

N2  - A 1962 bp cDNA clone of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (purH) was isolated from diapausing adults of Leptinotarsa decemlineata using RT-PCR and 3' and 5'-RACE. The probe generated from this clone hybridized to a transcript approximately 1960 bp in length on northern blots. The clone encodes for a deduced protein 594 amino acids in length with 73% identity, 83% similarity to purH from Drosophila melanogaster. Northern blot (total RNA) analysis determined that L. decemlineata purH (LdpurH) was downregulated in diapausing beetles stored at 10°C. Developmental studies revealed that LdpurH is expressed at nearly constant high levels in both nondiapausing and prediapause adults. LdpurH expression during the first 20 days of diapause is equivalent to that seen in nondiapausing beetles, after which expression decreases. Exposing 70 day old diapausing beetles to 20°C for 24 h induced an increase in expression of purH indicating that purH is regulated by temperature in diapausing/overwintering beetles.

N2  - We analysed the chromosome complement and male meiosis in a natural population of Mepraia gajardoi (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae). The normal karyotype of this species is 20 autosomes plus X1X2Y in males and X1X1X2X2 in females. We confirmed that M. gajardoi is cytogenetically strikingly different from M. spinolai (with which it was previously included), which supports the taxonomic separation of these two species. For the first time in the holocentric chromosomes of the subfamily Triatominae, a structural rearrangement was detected. Observations made during meiosis and mitosis indicated that one of eleven individuals had undergone a fusion between two non-homologous chromosomes, probably before germinal cell development. This autosomal translocation resulted in chromosomal irregularities such as an autosomal trivalent, autosomal univalents and chromosomal fragments, which altered the normal segregation of both autosomes and sex chromosomes. The chromosomal fragments resemble supernumerary or B chromosomes, which supports the idea that these chromosomes are remnants of structural rearrangements. The genetic consequences of translocations in holokinetic chromosomes and their role in the evolution of chromosomes in triatomines are also discussed.

N2  - Rhythms in abdominal pumping, heartbeats and discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) of CFV subtype (closed, flutter and ventilation periods) in adults of pine weevil Hylobius abietis were simultaneously recorded using an electrolytic microrespirometer and an infrared (IR) cardiograph or IR actograph (IRA). The cyclic release of carbon dioxide was associated with active ventilation (V phase) provided by vigorous abdominal pumping movements due to contractions of tonic longitudinal and transversal abdominal muscles, which are visible to the naked eye. On the IRA-recordings, the abdominal pumping signals are superimposed on the heartbeat spikes. The relative amplitude of the abdominal pumping signals on these recordings is more than 10 times greater than that of the heart beats. Visual observations showed that the subelytral cavity appeared to be closed during the release of carbon dioxide and open at other times. The flutter (F) of the CFV cycle is characterised by active miniature inspirations or ventilations before the V period. The miniature ventilation movements were imperceptible to the naked eye, but were recorded on the respirometer-actigraph as clear spikes. In addition, movements of the tip of the abdomen, of between 10-20 mm were seen under a stereomicroscope at a magnification of 40×. Some cycles were categorized as (C)FV cycles, when the C period disappears into the end of the V period. Abdominal pumping and miniature inspirations were clearly synchronized with the CFV cycles. Abdominal pumping movements, miniature inspirations or ventilations and heartbeats in adult H. abietis were distinguishable when recordings of the electrolytic microrespirometer-actograph and IRA were made in parallel. These three events were recognized by their different amplitudes and frequencies. It is presumed that abdominal pumping and miniature inspirations in adult H. abietis are obligatory rhythmic movements of different function and origin.

Both primary and secondary reproductives (neotenics) were equally effective in inhibiting the development of replacement reproductives. Single females totally inhibited the development of female secondary reproductives but did not affect the development of male secondary reproductives. Single males had neither a stimulatory nor inhibitory effect on the development of secondary reproductives. The inhibitory ability of pairs of primary reproductives shortly after dealation and at the stage of incipient colony formation (couple with the first batch of eggs) was also examined. While pairs of freshly dealated reproductives were not able to inhibit the development of neotenics, pairs of primary reproductives that had their first batch of eggs, fully inhibited the development of neotenics.

N2  - Cold tolerance of the eggs of the grasshopper, Chorthippus fallax (Zubovsky), was examined in the laboratory. Egg supercooling points varied from –6°C to –32.4°C and could be divided into two groups. The supercooling points of the higher SCP group ranged from –6°C to –14°C and those of lower SCP group from –21.8°C to –32.4°C. Although low temperature acclimation could slightly decrease the supercooling points of eggs, the effect was not significant for all embryonic developmental stages or acclimation periods. The supercooling capacity was obviously different between pre-diapause, diapause and post-diapause embryonic stages. The mean supercooling points of pre-diapause and diapause eggs were similar; –28.8 ± 1.6°C and –30.7 ± 1.0°C for non-acclimated eggs and –29.5 ± 1.3°C and –31.18 ± 0.8°C for acclimated eggs respectively. However, the mean supercooling points of post-diapause eggs were significantly higher; –12.9 ± 5.6°C for non-acclimated and –13.5 ± 4.5°C for acclimated eggs respectively. The survival rates of diapause eggs at > –25°C were not significantly different from that at 25°C, but survival rates at < –30°C decreased significantly. The lethal temperature (Ltemp50) for a 12 hrs exposure was –30.1°C, and the lethal time (Ltime50) at –25°C was 44 days. Since the SCPs of diapause eggs was similar to their Ltemp50, we may consider the supercooling capacity of such eggs is a good indicator of their cold hardiness and the species is a true freeze avoiding insect. Based on the analysis of local winter temperature data, pre-diapause and diapause, low SCP eggs can safely survive severe winters, but not the post-diapause, high SCP eggs. The importance of the overwintering strategy and the relationship between diapause and cold hardiness of this species is discussed.

N2  - The magnitude, direction and symmetry of intraguild predation (IGP) between the developmental stages of the aphidophagous Harmonia axyridis Pallas and Coccinella undecimpunctata L. were characterized and compared. Mobility and body weight were the main factors affecting the magnitude of IGP.H. axyridis was more often the predator than C. undecimpunctata and eggs the most vulnerable developmental stage. There was significant asymmetrical IGP on eggs by the second and later, and fourth larval stages of H. axyridis and C. undecimpunctata, respectively. Asymmetrical IGP of pupae was only recorded for the fourth larval stage of H. axyridis. There was no IGP between adults, but larvae of both species attacked heterospecifics. The best model of the relationship between rate of predation and the difference in the body weight of IG predator and prey differs for the two ladybirds. A small difference in the body weights leads to a marked increase in the rate of predation in H. axyridis but not in C. undecimpunctata. In asymmetrical combinations, increase in body weight of the intraguild predator did not significantly increase the rate of predation. Mobility and body weight were not the only important parameters involved in the symmetry of IGP. Aggressive behaviour of H. axyridis negatively affected the survival of C. undecimpunctata.

N2  - The endoparasitoid Glyptapanteles liparidis (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) injects polydnavirus and venom together with eggs into its Lymantria dispar (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) host larvae during oviposition. We studied effects of these parasitoid associated factors by means of g-irradiation-induced pseudoparasitization. The application of radiation for sterilization of female wasps as a tool to study interactions between parasitoid associated factors and the host is demonstrated in this paper. When wasps were irradiated at doses ranging from 24 to 96 Gy and then allowed to oviposit into L. dispar larvae, temporary sterilization was produced. On the first day post irradiation they laid 99% sterile eggs, but fertility recovered partially during the following days. Irradiation had no negative effect on the lifespan of wasps, but total fecundity was significantly reduced. Pseudoparasitization of L. dispar by irradiated G. liparidis caused prolonged larval development with supernumerary molts before pupation in females, and higher pupal weights in both sexes. Only 8 to 20% of pseudoparasitized larvae developed into adults; 20 to 33% died as larvae, 55 to 65% in pupae. Abnormities, such as precocious formation of pupal antennal pads in larvae or incomplete sclerotization of pupal cuticle occurred. Pseudoparasitization impaired the immune reactions of L. dispar larvae. Encapsulation of implanted plastic rods by hemocytes was reduced and hemolymph melanization was significantly suppressed 3 and 5 days post pseudoparasitization.

N2  - We have investigated the relative importance of bark roughness and host tree species in determining the diversity and make-up of coleopteran assemblages on the trunks of trees in sub-tropical rainforest in south-east Queensland, Australia. There are clear, statistically significant, patterns in the composition of the assemblages which reflect bark roughness. Rougher bark had associated greater species and family richness, a higher proportion of "rare" species, a higher value for Shannon diversity and lower values for the Simpson and Berger-Parker Index (measures of dominance within the sample). The data support strongly the idea that there is a bark-specific beetle assemblage. The rougher bark was associated with significantly greater numbers of an anobiid species, Dorcatoma sp., and of the latridiid species Aridius australicus. Rougher bark also harboured significantly larger species. The most likely explanation for this seems to be related to the physical heterogeneity and biological complexity of the habitat, presenting, as it does, greater opportunities for shelter, feeding specialisation and intra-species aggregation. Rougher bark contained a higher proportion of both predatory and xylophagous groups than did smoother categories. No clear influence of tree species could be detected although some trends were evident.

N2  - Second to fifth instars of nine New Caledonian species of Tingidae are described. A key to fifth instars is provided. The comparison of immature stages among the known larvae shows that translocation of marginal tubercles in larvae, considered as the general rule, is absent in New Caledonian larvae. Also, external morphology of larvae becomes more complex through development, by the addition and ramification of tubercles, as it does also through evolution. Such a tendency is reminiscent of a heterochronous phenomenon, like peramorphosis. Translocation phenomenon could be an intermediate stage of evolution in terms of aquiring more tubercles.

N2  - This paper presents a synthesis of morphological information on larvae of the beetle suborder Archostemata. Larvae of the following families and species were studied: Ommatidae: Omma sp.; Micromalthidae: Micromalthus debilis LeConte, 1878; Cupedidae: Priacma serrata LeConte, 1861, Distocupes varians (Lea, 1902), Rhipsideigma raffrayi (Fairmaire, 1884), Tenomerga cinerea (Say, 1831) and Tenomerga mucida (Chevrolat, 1829). Morphological characters of the suborder and three families are described. Monophyly of the suborder is strongly supported by more than 10 larval autapomorphies. A close relationship between Micromalthidae and Cupedidae is confirmed. New larval characters are introduced, including chaetotaxy of first instar larvae of Micromalthus LeConte, 1878, Priacma LeConte, 1874 and Distocupes Neboiss, 1984. An identification key to families and subfamilies of Archostematan larvae is provided, along with a checklist of extant Archostemata taxa. The work is illustrated with 120 morphological drawings.

N2  - A provisional larval groundplan of the family Hygrobiidae is provided through descriptions of internal and external features of three of six extant species, Hygrobia hermanni (Fabricius, 1775), H. wattsi Hendrich 2001 and H. australasiae (Clark, 1862) and phylogenetic interpretations. Hygrobiidae larvae are morphologically differing dramatically from all other known Adephaga by 20 autapomorphies. Structures involved with feeding, i.e., mouthparts, prepharynx and foregut are highly modified as a result of a specialisation on small tubificid worms and chironomid larvae. A placement of Hygrobiidae within Dytiscoidea is well supported by the reduced condition of the terminal abdominal segments, and the presence of 10 ancestral setae on femur and a clade comprising Hygrobiidae, Amphizoidae, and Dytiscidae by the presence of thin and elongate caudal tentorial arms, a very strong musculus verticopharyngalis and a longitudinally divided adductor tendon of the mandible. A highly modified foregut, reduced terminal spiracles VIII and the presence of tubular gills are features which distinguish hygrobiid larvae from those of other groups of Dytiscoidea (i.e, Amphizoidae, Noteridae, Dytiscidae). A sister-group relationship between Hygrobiidae and Dytiscidae is indicated by a distinctly shortened and transverse prepharynx and a cerebrum and suboesophaeal ganglion shifted to the anterior third of the head. Larvae of the Australian species H. wattsi and H. australasiae share the presence of a bluntly rounded mandible and an apical position of the primary pore MNd in instar I as potential synapomorphies.

On average the mites made two integumental perforations for feeding on prepupae and one on pupae. Most of the punctures were on particular ventral sites on the abdomen. Possible reasons for this pronounced preference and the evolutionary aspects of this highly specialised parasite-host relationship are discussed.

N2  - The rose grain aphid, Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) is one of the three most important cereal aphid species in Europe. High temperature is detrimental for the survival of this species. Detailed experiments were conducted on the effect of high temperature (27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 31.5, 32.5, 33 and 34°C), period of exposure (2, 3, 4, 6 and 8 h per day for 1, 2, 4, 6 days) and developmental stage (2nd, 3rd, 4th instar nymph and adult) on the survival of the aphid. The results show that all three factors significantly affect survival. Temperatures over 29°C for 8 h significantly reduced survival, which decreased generally as the temperature increased. The survival was inversely related to the period of exposure. Exposing aphids to 32.5°C for 4 h or longer significantly reduced survival. Mature aphids had a lower tolerance of high temperatures than nymphs. Periods of high temperature experienced by 4th instar and adult aphids can greatly affect their survival. The value of these results for forecasting and determining control thresholds, the effect of global warming on cereal aphid abundance and the dropping off behaviour of the aphids are discussed.

The female parasitoids were 24–36 h old and were left to forage for 1 h on an eggplant leaf on which 10 nymphs of each instar of A. gossypii or M. persicae were placed. The percentage of A. gossypii nymphs mummified was higher than that of M. persicae (43.2 and 25.2%, respectively). The parasitoid parasitized nymphs of all instars of both aphid species, but it showed a preference for 1st and 2nd instars of A. gossypii and 1st instar of M. persicae. Nymphs of both aphid species parasitized in the 1st and 2nd instars were mummified when reached the 4th instar or adult stage, whereas those parasitized in the 3rd and 4th instars were mummified in the adult stage. The importance of these results in the effectiveness of A. colemani in biological control of A. gossypii and M. persicae is discussed.

N2  - Some behavioural aspects of the reproductive biology of Megaselia andrenae Disney, a kleptoparasite of the communal bee Andrena agilissima (Scopoli), were investigated at the nesting site of its host at Isola d’Elba (Italy). The scuttle fly mates more often in the early afternoon, which coincides with the period when the provisioning flights of its host are more frequent. The presence of the flies at the host nesting site, either in copula or single, is lower in the morning. In general only the females enter the host nests immediately after a mate, in a few cases closely followed by the males. When leaving the nest, females refuse to mate again with the males waiting outside. Observations on the ovaries of the females revealed no differences, either in the number of eggs or in the length of the most mature egg, between the individuals collected in copula or when flying alone. The species is sexually dimorphic, the females being larger than males. Male size does not seem to influence the females choice for mating.

N2  - The adult sex ratio among the genus Parnassius is usually strongly male biased and close to 2 : 1. This paper presents the results of comparative studies, on the basis of data from wild and captive reared populations of apollo butterfly in the Pieniny National Park (Western Carpathians, Poland). Sex ratio among the wild population is strongly male biased and close to 2 : 1, whereas there was no sex ratio bias among the captive population. However, among the captive individuals caught after releasing into the wild, males significantly outnumbered females. There was a significant, sex-related, difference in activity pattern recorded in the field studies: while the majority of females were observed sitting, males were usually flying. This result suggests that the observed sex ratio shifting is at least partially an artifact caused by the more cryptic behaviour of females. The sex ratio bias was more pronounced in the wild population than in captive individuals caught after releasing into wild, which suggests that difference in detectability between the sexes is not the only reason for males outnumbering females.

N2  - Mass releases of Trichogramma confusum Viggiani and T. maidis Pintureau & Voegele are widely used to control lepidopterous pests. They have long been considered to be the subspecies of T. chilonis Ishii and T. brassicae Bezdenko, respectively. To re-examine the taxonomic status of these closely related Trichogramma species, the internally transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA was used as a molecular marker to detect between-species differences. The ITS2 regions of 7 different Trichogramma species collected from China, Germany and France were sequenced and the inter-species distances were calculated. To quantify within-species sequence variation, the ITS2 regions of 6 geographical populations of T. dendrolimi Matsumura collected from across China were sequenced and compared. The results show that the ITS2 sequences of T. confusum and T. maidis are sufficiently different from those of T. chilonis and T. brassicae, respectively, that it is difficult to group them as cryptic species, whereas there are only minor differences between the T. dendrolimi populations. The ITS2 sequences identified in this study, coupled with 67 ITS2 sequences from a wide geographical distribution retrieved from GenBank, were then used for phylogenetic analyses. The results support previous records of minor within-species ITS2 sequence divergence and distinct interspecies differences. The cladograms show the T. maidis sequence clustered within T. evanescens Westwood, while the ITS2 sequences of T. confusum and T. chilonis are clustered in different branches. Taken together, these data suggest that T. maidis is not T. brassicae, but a cryptic or sibling species of T. evanescens; T. confusum and T. chilonis are not cryptic species but two closely related sister species.

N2  - Two-choice experiments on prey preferences of a generalist predator Pterostichus melanarius, and five species of slug prey, were conducted in the laboratory. Different preferences of P. melanarius for each of the slug species are described. They are interpreted as the outcome of differing slug species-specific defence mechanisms. The influence of hunger level, temperature, day/light period, condition of slugs and beetles, weight of slugs and beetles, and the sex of beetles were controlled experimentally or statistically. The order of slug species preference for predation by P. melanarius was: Deroceras reticulatum (Agriolimacidae), Malacolimax tenellus, Lehmania marginata (Limacidae), Arion distinctus and A. subfuscus (Arionidae). Efficiency of slugs’ species-specific defence mechanisms reflected their phylogeny. Defence mechanisms of slugs from the superfamily Arionoidea were significantly more effective at deterring an attack of non-specialised ground beetles than the defence mechanisms of slugs from Limacoidea superfamily. P. melanarius significantly preferred Agriolimacidae to Limacidae, and Limacidae to Arionidae. Slug species was the strongest factor influencing prey preferences of P. melanarius amongst slug prey. Surprisingly, this preference was much more significant than the slug weight. Weight and sex of P. melanarius had no impact on its prey preference.

N2  - The maximum size of ingested ball-shaped particles was determined in three species of adult dung feeding beetle: Anoplotrupes (Geotrupes) stercorosus and Geotrupes spiniger (Geotrupidae, Geotrupinae) and Sphaeridium lunatum (Hydrophilidae, Sphaeridiinae). Maximum diameters were 40–65 µm, 60–75 µm and 16–19 µm in A. stercorosus, G. spiniger and S. lunatum, respectively, and it was concluded that these beetles feed in the same way as found in previous studies on coprophagous scarabaeids (Scarabaeinae and Aphodiinae). Coarse particles, mainly indigestible plant fragments, are rejected by an unknown filtering mechanism, and only very small particles are actually ingested. The two geotrupids, however, tolerate somewhat larger particles than do scarabaeines of similar size. This may reflect a lower degree of specialisation towards dung feeding in the geotrupids than in the scarabaeines. In several ways, the mouthparts of the coprophagous Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae and Hydrophilidae show essentially the same morphological modifications that must be adaptations for dung feeding. For the hydrophilid (Sphaeridium), such modifications are described for the first time. They include asymmetric mandibular molars (right convex, left concave), fitting exactly into each other, with highly specialised surfaces that may concentrate the food prior to ingestion by squeezing fluid out of it. Other examples are the conjunctives (scarabaeids and geotrupids) or similar structures (the hydrophilid) and the large, hairy, pad-like distal lobes of the maxillar galeae. Provided that current views on the evolutionary history of these beetles are correct, dung feeding has arisen independently in the Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae and Hydrophilidae. If so, the feeding on very small particles and the concomitant modifications of mouthparts in these three groups must be results of parallel evolution.

N2  - The coexistence of discrete morphs within a species, with one morph more conspicuous than the other(s) is often thought to result from both sexual selection and predation. In many damselflies, sexual dimorphism occurs jointly with multiple female colour morphs. Typically, one morph is coloured like the male (andromorph), while the other(s) is not (gynomorph(s)). The mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of such female polymorphism in damselflies remain poorly understood, especially the role of predation. We tested the detectability of two different female colour morphs of the damselfly, Enallagma cyathigerum, using human observers as model predators; andromorphs were detected more frequently than gynomorphs. Field data on mortality of males and the two different female morphs due to predation or drowning were also collected, and these observations support morph-specific mortality. In natural populations predation risk was higher in males than females; gynomorphs, however, were more prone to predation than andromorphs. Differences in behaviour between morphs, rather than colour, may explain this result.

N2  - The development of Adalia bipunctata larvae feeding on the grain aphid Sitobion avenae was investigated at 15, 20 and 25°C and two different levels of food supply. Increased temperatures accelerated development and reduced mortality rates. A reduced food supply slowed down development and increased mortality at all life stages. The total food intake of larvae ranged from 24–65 mg, which is equivalent to up to 190 aphids. Larvae compensated for low food supply by reducing development rates, high prey exploitation efficiencies, reaching up to 100%, and by high prey-biomass conversion efficiencies, reaching over 40%. The findings are discussed under the aspect of suitability of A. bipunctata as a biological control agent for greenhouse-specific aphid pest species.

N2  - The detailed external morphology and general anatomy of the majority of families and subfamilies of Poduromorpha were investigated and compared. This examination was done in relation to the three remaining orders of Collembola: Entomobryomorpha, Symphypleona and Neelipleona. Within Poduromorpha, homologies among the different families and subfamilies are established for general chaetotaxy, and chaeotaxy of head, buccal cone, sensilla of fourth antennal segment, anal valves and tibiotarsus. A consistent and comprehensive nomenclature is proposed for these morphological features unifying those applied in scattered existing studies. Observations on first instars are reported. Comparison of first instars and adult chaetotaxy suggests a possible paedomorphic trend in the evolution of Poduromorpha.

N2  - First instar larvae of Polystoechotidae sp., and first and older instar larvae of Ithone fusca Newman and Oliarces clara Banks are described; those of the latter species for the first time. The family Ithonidae is unique in Neuroptera in having grub-like C-shaped older instar larvae. Potential morphological synapomorphies of mature larvae of Ithonidae and Polystoechotidae are the mandibles with exceptionally broad base and markedly thickened apical part; antennal curvature is fixed and rather characteristic in shape; ocular area reduced or absent; cardo and stipes are markedly enlarged with stipes much larger than the cardo; presence of gula (Polystoechotes) or some traces of gular sclerotisation (Ithone, Oliarces). Larvae of Ithone have numerous larval autapomorphies such as C-shaped first instar larva with reduced abdominal segments IX and X; fused tibia and tarsus on all legs and dorsally directed maxillae. Larvae of Ithonidae and Polystoechotidae have some similarities with those of the family Dilaridae, such as no or one pair of stemmata; body not flattened dorso-laterally; mesothoracic spiracle located on fold between prothorax and mesothorax; short and stout mandibles widened at base and tapered apically; robust and elongated fore legs; tarsi on all legs markedly shortened; more than three larval instars. Older instar larvae of Ithonidae are markedly similar to those of the beetle superfamily Scarabaeoidea in having a C-shaped body, at least in older instars; body round in cross-section; sclerites on thorax and abdomen reduced and body surface membranous; each thoracic and abdominal segment subdivided dorsally into two or three fleshy lobes; ventral surface of abdominal apex bears a field of short and stout setae. Chaetotaxy pattern in first instar Ithonidae and Polystoechotidae larvae suggests that it is possible to homologise the sensilla in different genera and provide a system of sensilla designation for Neuroptera larvae. This study is illustrated with 36 morphological drawings.

N2  - We describe here the in vitro rearing of Anagrus breviphragma Soyka, an egg parasitoid of Cicadella viridis (Linnaeus), from the second instar larva to the adult stage. Three media, containing mainly either a commercial tissue culture medium (IPL-41), skimmed milk or veal homogenate, were tested. Larval development occurred on all the diets but few larvae reached the pupal stage on the diets containing skimmed milk or veal homogenate. On the tissue culture medium, pharate adults, albeit malformed, developed. Supplementing the tissue culture medium-based diet with chicken egg yolk alone, or combined with yeast extract, further improved parasitoid development. The addition of both egg yolk and yeast extract resulted in twelve out of twenty larvae reaching the adult stage, of which only four females emerged.

N2  - The effect of constant temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30°C) on several biological parameters of Noctua atlantica (Warren), a noctuid endemic to the Azores, was studied using an artificial diet as food. At 5 and 30°C no eggs hatched. Developmental time (egg, larval, pupal and egg-to-adult) differed significantly at each temperature. Pupal weight (males and females) was significantly higher at 10°C and lower at 25°C. Adult longevity and the pre-oviposition period were longer at 10 and 15°C and differed significantly from those observed at higher temperatures. The mean number of eggs laid per female (fecundity) was significantly higher at 15°C, and lower at 25°C. Pupal weight (males and females) was positively correlated with larval, pupal, egg-to-adult developmental times and with adult longevity. Female pupal weight was also positively correlated with the pre-oviposition period and with fecundity. Temperatures ranging from 10 to 20°C are the most suitable for the development of N. atlantica, suggesting that this species is well adapted to the climatic conditions found in their natural habitat. The number of day-degrees required for the development from egg to adult emergence was 1428.57 D°, and 117.79 D° for the pre-oviposition period. Thus, N. atlantica can have two generations per year at high altitudes (550 or 800 m) in the Azores.

N2  - Diapause fixation and development were studied in females of a Czech population of Aquarius paludum by monitoring changes in oxygen uptake, weight and reproduction potential in field adults between August and February. The fall in oxygen uptake related to fresh weight (from > 1000 µl O2 per g per h to around 500 µl O2 per g per h) in field adults during early diapause was similar in two age cohorts, although the time of adult ecdysis differed by 50 days and thus occurred at markedly different temperatures and photoperiods of late August vs. early October. The different conditions affected the weight of females and thus also the absolute value of oxygen consumption: both parameters were much lower in the October females. The seasonal time of diapause termination in A. paludum did not differ from findings in other cold temperate insects: diapause and the photoperiodic response ended in the winter, as was shown by the possibility of insects’ reactivation by 26°C in spite of a diapause promoting daylength of 12L : 12D. In most females (78.6%) ovaries matured after transfer to these conditions in mid-February, while ovarian maturation occurred in only 16.7% of females transferred in early January and no ovarian maturation was observed in females transferred in early December. Ovarian maturation was preceded by a transient increase in oxygen consumption from 600 µl O2 per g per h to 1400 µl O2 per g per h.

N2  - The cocoons characteristic of the prepupal and pupal stages of many insects vary widely in size, durability, structure, shape and colour, as well as in other features such as orientation and attachment to the substrate. In some species they vary seasonally. Most cocoons provide little direct insulation, although they may reduce the rate at which temperature changes, but many provide the mechanical protection required for overwintering beneath insulating substrates such as soil and snow. The cocoons of some terrestrial species prevent inoculative freezing by isolating the integument from ice crystals on the cocoon surface or its surroundings. In some aquatic species, cocoons appear to limit damage by providing mechanical protection during the freezing of surrounding water. Some cocoons help in the acquisition of solar heat: dark structures are especially effective because dark pigments absorb heat, and surrounding layers trap this heat. Insects are immobilized when it is cold and so cannot move in response to environmental threats, and protective cocoons made for winter tend to be more robust than their summer counterparts. Such cocoons protect against abrasion of the waterproof layer of the cuticle. In some species, robust cocoons or complex structures impede natural enemies. Cocoon silk has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal actions. Other cocoons are more or less waterproof. These and other features withstand simultaneous constraints in addition to cold. Therefore, cocoons enhance survival during cold conditions in many species. However, this conclusion is based on fragmentary evidence, and there has been relatively little explicit examination of the roles of cocoons during winter. Therefore, specific work is required to assess resistance to or enhancement of inoculative freezing, resistance to penetration by natural enemies and water, the roles of particular cocoon silks and silk constituents, and the quantitative contributions of cocoons to winter survival in nature.

N2  - Cryptobiosis is the state when the metabolic activity of an organism is hardly measurable or is reversibly at a standstill. Many groups of invertebrates have this ability, and can be divided into two types according to the developmental stage in which it occurs; embryonic (eggs) or post-embryonic stages (larvae and adults). The latter must be able to reversibly regulate the physiology and biochemistry of development and cryptobiosis. There are several reviews on cryptobiosis and its regulation, but none on the physiological mechanism of cryptobiosis in chironomids. The present paper reviews the physiological traits of invertebrates entering cryptobiosis in a post-embryonic stage. These unique phenomena, which occur in a post-embryonic stage of three groups of cryptobiotic invertebrates (insects, tardigrades and nematodes) are discussed with particular reference to; 1) the behavioural and physiological adaptations of cryptobiotic invertebrates, 2) role of trehalose in cryptobiosis and 3) regulation of cryptobiosis.

N2  - Great progress has recently been made in cryobiology. One field, however, has been neglected: the temporal sequence of the effects of photoperiod and temperature, and their relative importance in cold hardening. This is relevant to the question of importance of diapause in cold-hardiness. Denlinger (1991) outlined the categories of such relations and stressed a great need for further detailed research. A survey of studies done over the past decade revealed many gaps in the evidence and the ambiguous nature of the data on the photoperiodic regulation of cold-hardiness. We hope that this review will stimulate further research in this field. Among several directions where research is most needed we have stressed (1) simultaneous recording of changes in survival and dynamics of suspected cryoprotectants (stressed also by Danks, 1996), (2) checking the regulation of different phases of cold hardening, and (3) discrimination between direct and indirect (mediated via neuroendocrine system) effects of environmental cues on cold hardening.

N2  - Many insects in temperate regions overwinter in diapause, during which they are cold hardy. In these insects, one of the metabolic adaptations to the unfavorable environmental conditions is the synthesis of cryoprotectants/anhydroprotectants. The aim of this study was to investigate the connection between the antioxidative system and synthesis of cryoprotectants (mainly glycerol) in diapausing larvae of the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). At two periods during diapause (November and February), in three groups of insects (kept under field conditions; –12°C for two weeks; 8°C for two weeks), the activity of key enzymes of the antioxidative system and oxidative part of the hexose monophosphate shunt were measured: superoxide dismutase, catalase, non selenium glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, as well that of the antioxidative components: total glutathione and ascorbate, and dehydroascorbate reductase. There was a higher activity of antioxidative enzymes at the beginning of the diapause period (November) compared to late diapause (February), while glutathione and ascorbate were higher in February. Similarly, there was a lower activity of the hexose monophosphate shunt enzymes in February. Exposure of larvae to –12°C resulted in an elevation of hexose monophosphate shunt enzyme activity, especially in November. This was accompanied by a significant increase in glycerol content in February. Changes in ascorbate levels and dehydroascorbate reductase activity in both experimental groups (–12°C and 8°C) suggest a connection between the antioxidative system, metabolism during diapause and cold hardiness. Our results support the notion that antioxidative defense in larvae of Ostrinia nubilalis is closely connected with metabolic changes characteristic of diapause, mechanisms of cold hardiness involved in diapause and the maintenance of a stable redox state.

N2  - The relations between the patterns of discontinuous gas exchange cycles (DGCs) and water loss were investigated in non-chilled diapausing pupae of the white cabbage butterfly Pieris brassicae kept at room temperature (22–24°C) in Petri dishes. An electrolytic respirometer, combined with an infrared (IR) actographic device was used for the simultaneous recordings of metabolic rate, cyclic release of carbon dioxide (bursts), passive suction inspirations (PSIs) and body movements. The patterns of cyclic gas exchange in four- and five-month-old non-chilled diapausing pupae varied individually to a considerable extent. About 40% of the pupae displayed long DGCs lasting 1–3 h, while the interburst periods were characterised by rare and almost regular large PSIs succeeding at intervals of 1–4 min. Nearly 30% of the pupae exhibited short DGCs lasting 3–5 min, while between the bursts there occurred unclear frequent gas exchange microcycles. Standard metabolic rate (SMR) did not reveal significant differences between long DGCs and short DGCs ranging from 32–56 (mean 47.6 ± 4.6) ml O2 g–1 h–1, and 28–61 (mean 44.95 ± 5.3) ml O2 g–1 h–1, respectively. The mentioned levels of SMR were characteristic of diapausing pupae.Water loss in pupae with long DGCs was determined gravimetrically to be 0.29 ± 0.1 mg g–1 day1. At the same time, water loss in pupae that showed only short DGCs and irregular microcycles was 1.73 ± 0.31 mg g–1 day–1, which was significantly higher than in individuals characterised by long DGCs. We suggest that water loss in the non-chilled diapausing pupae may depend significantly on the patterns of cyclic gas exchange: long cycles and rare but deep PSIs exerted a marked water conserving effect.

N2  - Precocious activity of parasitoids is a key factor for cereal aphid control. We investigated the oviposition, flight and walking capacities at low temperature of four aphid parasitoids (Aphidius rhopalosiphi, A. ervi, Praon volucre, P. gallicum) on one of their aphid hosts (Sitobion avenae). Oviposition behaviour was tested at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 and 20°C, under a photoperiod of 12 h light. Some females of A. rhopalosiphi oviposited at 6°C while the percentage of parasitization below 10°C remained low for the other species. The proportion of males decreased with temperature for A. ervi, P. volucre and P. gallicum but not for A. rhopalosiphi. For all species, flight and walking activities increased with temperature, Aphidius species being active at lower temperature than Praon species. Field captures showed that the activity threshold for A. rhopalosiphi is 12°C, 15°C for A. ervi and P. volucre, and 19.5°C for P. gallicum. These results are discussed regarding the potential of these four species for aphid control.

N2  - More than half of the insects collected on snow in Central Poland were flies (Diptera). Altogether 83 species of Diptera from 27 families were identified, of which 9 families were recorded for the first time. Two thirds of the Diptera belonged to the Mycetophilidae and Trichoceridae, which were also very species-rich. Other families with many species were the Heleomyzidae, Sphaeroceridae nd Phoridae.The peak activity was in the first part of December. Flies were most active on snow when the humidity ranged from 80 to 100%, temperatures between –1 to 5°C and the snow was from 20 to 40 cm deep. The occurrence of Trichoceridae was strictly associated with high humidities, in contrast to Drosophilidae and Heleomyzidae, which were most active at lower humidities. The activity of the flies of the most frequently recorded families was displaced towards either lower (Heleomyzidae and Limoniidae) or higher temperatures (Trichoceridae, Mycetophilidae). In contrast to other families, the supranivean activity of Phoridae was strictly associated with thin snow cover.

N2  - Survival under dry conditions was examined in males and females of Alphitobius diaperinus Panzer (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), a beetle of tropical origin. The range of individual responses and the effect of gender on water loss were also evaluated. Females exhibit significantly longer survival (Lt50 and Lt90) than males under desiccating conditions. Larger females beetles have a greater initial water mass and hence can tolerate greater water losses. Such beetles have longer survival under dry conditions. Males and females loose an average of 54.8 and 58.9% of their body water prior to death. The insects were inactive most of the time, when kept under dry conditions; the rate of decrease in body water was thus reduced. Beetles of both gender display a negative correlation between the rates of water loss under desiccating conditions and the duration of survival. We conclude that the difference in survival period between males and females is due to a combination of greater female tolerance to desiccation and larger body size.

N2  - Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) was used to examine the dispersal of females of a geometrid moth, Epirrita autumnata, in Fennoscandia. A 542-bp-portion of the CR of 200 individuals from four northern and four southern localities was sequenced. The mtDNA CR of E. autumnata contains a substantial amount of variation as a total of 108 mtDNA haplotypes were observed. Between the northern and the southern localities (~1100 km), there was a moderate level of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.128). The amount of variation in the mtDNA CR of E. autumnata was lower in the north than in the south. The reduction in genetic variability may result from a combination of historical bottlenecks that date back to the post-glacial recolonization of Fennoscandia and, present-day bottlenecks due to the northern E. autumnata populations experiencing repeated outbreaks followed by collapse in population size. On a small spatial scale (0.6–19 km), within the northern and southern areas, no genetic differentiation was detected suggesting ongoing gene flow due to the dispersal of E. autumnata females among the localities. This finding was contrary to our earlier expectation of poor flying ability of E. autumnata females.

N2  - The genus Zabrus Clairville, 1806 is a Holomediterranean taxon that radiated into about a hundred species most likely during the Cenozoic. There are four endemic subgenera on the Iberian Peninsula, which include 28 species, Epomidozabrus (3 spp.), Euryzabrus (1 sp.), Platyzabrus (2 spp.) and Iberozabrus (22 spp.). A mitochondrial fragment comprising part of the cytochrome-oxidase-I, tRNAleu, and part of the cytochrome-oxidase-II genes was sequenced of most of these species. Taxa of other subgenera of Zabrus (Macarozabrus, Polysitus, Zabrus, and Pelor), six species of Amara (the putative sister taxon of Zabrus), and representatives of tribes related to Zabrini were also sequenced. The results show that the genus Zabrus is a monophyletic taxon well separated from Amara. The four subgenera endemic to the Iberian Peninsula also make up a monophyletic clade, which stresses the association between the geographic distribution and the monophyly of many supraspecific taxa within this genus. The species-rich subgenus Iberozabrus seems to be the sister taxon of the clade made up of the three other subgenera endemic to the Iberian Peninsula. The Iberozabrus species-groups proposed by Andújar & Serrano in 2001, based on morphological and geographical grounds, are only partly corroborated by the molecular phylogeny. The lack of congruence between these data sets is mainly between those species-groups with large numbers of species and more complex geographic patterns. Some cases of incongruence are possibly due to homoplasic external characters appeared by convergent evolution.

N2  - Heartbeat reversal patterns have been monitored in the body of diapausing pupae of M. sexta 2 h before and 3 h after the injections of [Arg7]-corazonin, using noninvasive thermographic and optocardiographic methods. Large dosages (10–6 M final concentrations of corazonin in the body) caused almost immediate, adrenaline-like enhancement of the anterograde heartbeat. During the relatively short, acute phase of the tachycardia induced by corazonin, the systolic anterograde contractions of the heart increased in average from 10.5 to 24 pulses per min, culminating at 2.5 min after the injections. Duration of the acute period of tachycardia was only 7 to 20 min, which was followed by a period of slightly elevated, residual anterograde heartbeat which persisted occasionally for 1 to 3 h. Smaller dosages of corazonin (10–7M concentrations in the body) occasionally also produced a less intensive cardiotropic effect, while the more diluted samples were completely inactive. In pupae of the beetle T. molitor, injections of corazonin (10–6 M in the body) had no effect on the rate of in vivo heartbeat at all. Pharmacological analysis of the effects of corazonin in M. sexta indicated that the cardiostimulating effects of corazonin did not conform with the expected action of a peptidic neurohormone. A possibility that these effects might be artifacts produced by the low molecular breakdown products of corazonin has been discussed.

N2  - In warm temperate and subtropical regions an adult summer diapause regulates the timing of oviposition. Epilachna admirabilis is a univoltine phytophagous lady beetle ranging from south to north Japan, Taiwan, China and Myanmar. In Japan the species hibernates in the full-grown larval stage. In cool temperate Sapporo (43°04´N) the adults never enter summer diapause but pass a second winter in diapause. This study revealed that in Kyoto (35°01´N), the adults had a summer diapause induced by an intermediate photoperiodic response; they had a critical photoperiod of approximately 14.5 h light per day. All females entered reproductive diapause under a long photoperiod of 16L (light) : 8D (dark) and 6.7% of them did so under shorter photoperiods of 13L : 11D and 12L : 12D. However, diapause incidence was 40% at 8L : 16D, suggesting the existence of a second critical photoperiod at a photophase slightly less than 8 h. At photophases of 12–15 h, non-diapausing females laid eggs on average between 27.1 to 39.0 days after emergence. Photoperiod reversibly regulated the induction, maintenance and termination of the adult diapause. Temperatures of 20–30°C did not affect the incidence and termination of diapause at 16L : 8D. Adult winter diapause at the higher latitude Sapporo might have originated from adult summer diapause at middle latitude regions such as Kyoto. Selection at increasing latitudes would have forced northerly populations of the species to lose the adult summer diapause in the range of natural day-lengths. Subsequent selection pressure should have favored adults that avoided futile oviposition in late summer or autumn, survived cold winters in diapause and commenced an additional oviposition

N2  - The aphid Tuberculatus quercicola (Matsumura), a non host-alternating species, lives on Daimyo oak, Quercus dentata Thumberg, and other species of oak. In summer there was a significant reduction in the total amino acid concentration in phloem sap of the host plant and fecundity of the aphids. There are two phenotypes of Q. dentata: one produces flush leaves in mid-July and the other does not. This study investigates the effect of the flush leaves produced by Q. dentata in summer on the density, fecundity and honeydew excretion by T. quercicola. Of 20 shoots on each of the study trees, 6–13 (average 8.8 shoots) produced secondary shoots with flush leaves. The number of aphids on flush leaves sharply increased by two-fold compared to that on mature leaves. The aphids reared on flush leaves were significantly larger and had a larger embryo number compared to those on mature leaves. These results suggest that the phloem sap of flush leaves has a high nutritive quality for aphids. However, in mid-summer and early autumn T. quercicola went into reproductive diapause regardless of whether it was reared on flush or mature leaves. Aphid colonies persisted until October even on trees that did not produce secondary leaves. These observations suggest that this aphid does not depend on secondary leaf production. Thus, the use of flush leaves does not enable T. quercicola to avoid nutritional stress in summer and the need for reproductive diapause.

N2  - The effect of wing length (brachyptery and macroptery) on mating activity was investigated in adult males and females of a flightless wing-polymorphic insect, Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.). Mating activity of the brachypterous and macropterous adult bugs was assessed according to 14 different parameters. The competition tests revealed higher numbers of copulations and greater duration of mating activity in brachypterous than in macropterous males. Brachypterous males are between two to four times more successful in competition for females than their macropterous counterparts, depending on the wing morph and physiological status of the females. Decreased mating success of macropterous males is associated with the smaller size of their accessory glands. Lowered competitive ability for mates is a likely penalty associated with macroptery. Receptivity tests showed the highest tendency to mate in reproductive brachypterous females, lower in macropterous females and the least in diapausing brachypterous females. This is the first report of decreased mating propensity of macropterous morphs in insects with non-functional wing polymorphism. The association of lowered mating success with the higher dispersal activity of the macropterous morph in this bug and a trade-off between the ability to reproduce and to disperse in the flightless wing-polymorphic insects is discussed.

N2  - We recorded the association between the planthopper Tettigometra laetus Herrich-Schäffer, 1835 (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha: Tettigometridae) and three ant species belonging to the subfamilies Myrmicinae and Formicinae in a coastal dune area of Flanders (Belgium). Lasius psammophilus Seifert, Tetramorium caespitum L. and Formica cunicularia Latreille were observed attending and palpating the dorsal glandular area of this planthopper, taking honeydew directly from its anus, herding them and carrying them into their nests when disturbed. The planthopper was rarely found in the absence of ants and probably develops within ant nests, which may provide protection against predation and adverse weather conditions. The natural history of temperate ant-hemipteran relationships is discussed.

N2  - We examined the occurrence of carabid beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae) at the edges of oak (Quercus pyrenaica) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) forests in León, NW Spain. Pitfall traps were used to collect beetles from April to October 2002, and leaf litter cover and depth were measured. Traps were placed at three distances (0, 50 and 100 m) from the edges of eight forest patches. A total of 5436 carabids belonging to 43 species were collected. We found no statistically significant edge effect at the carabid assemblage level, i.e. the number of species and individuals was not higher at the edge compared to the forest interior. However, individual species were affected by distance from the edge. Five of the 14 species analysed responded predictably to the edge, three of them statistically significantly so. Four species did not respond in the predicted direction, two of them statistically significantly so. We found a considerable difference between forest types in terms of carabid assemblage composition and response to the edge. Oak forests were species richer and beech forests had a higher number of individuals. These differences were probably due to small-scale habitat heterogeneity in the oak forest patches, caused by man, and the homogeneous structure of beech forests. Leaf litter appeared to be one possible factor influencing the distribution of some species from the interior to the edge of forests.

N2  - The suctorial proboscis of adult Lepidoptera represents a key morphological innovation that enabled these insects to gain access to new food sources. In the ancestral condition of the lepidopteran proboscis only extrinsic galeal muscles are present in the basal joint region. The presence of additional muscles (i.e., the intrinsic galeal muscles) is regarded as a morphological novelty of the Myoglossata that evolved after the galeae were modified to form suctorial mouthparts. The present comparative investigation of the galeal anatomy in representatives of all major taxa revealed that the intrinsic galeal muscles are derived from the basal galeal musculature. In the examined Neopseustoidea, Exoporia, Nepticuloidea, Incurvarioidea, and Tischerioidea all galeal muscles have their origin in the stipes-galea joint and/or in the proximal region of the galea. Two muscle units form the basal galeal musculature of the joint region and one to three longitudinal muscles extend into the galea lumen. Multiple intrinsic galeal muscles, of which both the origin and attachment sites are markedly distal from the basal joint region are regarded as a groundplan autapomorphy of the Ditrysia. Some slightly oblique muscles may occur along the lateral wall; these were lost in species with extremely slender galeae. In most investigated Obtectomera two series of intrinsic galeal muscles occur; these are the (1) oblique lateral intrinsic galeal muscles, which are arranged one upon the other along the lateral proboscis wall and (2) the median intrinsic galeal muscles, which run more or less longitudinally along the ventral wall. Oblique muscle arrangement probably evolved in concert with the functional demands of a long lepidopteran proboscis. A likely evolutionary pathway to account for the serial arrangement of galeal muscles is proposed.

N2  - Paleoripiphorus deploegi gen. n., sp. n. and Macrosiagon ebboi sp. n., described from two French Albo-Cenomanian ambers (mid Cretaceous), are the oldest definitely identified representatives of the Ripiphoridae: Ripiphorinae. They belong to or are closely related to extant genera of this coleopteran subfamily. Together with Myodites burmiticus Cockerell, 1917 from the Albian Burmese amber, they demonstrate that the group is distinctly older than suggested by the hitherto available fossil record. By inference after the biology of the extant Ripiphorinae, Macrosiagon ebboi may have been parasitic on wasps and Paleoripiphorus deploegi on bees, suggesting that Apoidea may have been present in the Lower Cretaceous.

N2  - The genus Platesthes Waterhouse, 1845 (Pimeliinae: Praocini), distributed in the Patagonian steppes in southern Argentina and Chile, is revised. A phylogeny of its 13 species is proposed, based on 48 morphological characters. The cladistic analysis provides one most parsimonious cladogram showing that three unambiguous synapomorphic characters of external morphology and male genitalia support the monophyly of Platesthes. This article includes a redescription of the genus, redescriptions of its species, an identification key, habitus photographs of the most representative species, illustrations of external morphology, genital features and metendosternites, a cladogram and distribution maps. A discussion of the biogeography and status of conservation of Platesthes in the Patagonian steppes and in Central Chile is presented. A new Platesthes species is described: P. neuquensis sp. n. and P. hirtipes Kulzer, 1962 stat. n. is elevated to species status. Other valid species of the genus are: P. depressa (Guérin-Ménéville, 1841), P. similis Kulzer, 1956, P. unicosta Kulzer, 1956, P. nigra Kulzer, 1956, P. pilosa Kulzer, 1956, P. vidali Peña, 1986, P. burmeisteri Haag-Rutenberg, 1877, P. granulipennis Kulzer, 1956, P. kuscheli Kulzer, 1958, P. humeralis Kulzer, 1958 and P. silphoides Waterhouse, 1845 (type species), for which a lectotype is designated.

N2  - Concordant differences in morphology, phenology and RAMS markers, as well as in sequenced mtDNA (COI, COII, cytb) and nuclear DNA (ITS2) fragments, indicate that Dolerus asper Zaddach, 1859 and Dolerus brevicornis Zaddach, 1859 are valid species. On the basis of morphology, molecular markers, and distributional records, both species are distinct from Dolerus gibbosus Hartig, 1837 (= Dolerus planatus Hartig, 1837). Taxonomy of the species is clarified and the neotypes of Dolerus asper Zaddach, 1859 and Dolerus brevicornis Zaddach, 1859 are designated. The synonymies of Dolerus asper Zaddach, 1859, to Dolerus planatus Hartig, 1837 and Dolerus derzavini Malaise, 1931, spec. rev. to D.asper Zaddach, 1859 are abandoned. Dolerus carbonarius Zaddach, 1859 and Dolerus fumosus Zaddach, 1859 are considered to be species inquirendae. Phylogenetic analyses of the ITS2 fragment and fragments of ITS2 + COI and ITS2 + COII yielded the topology [D.asper, (D.brevicornis, D. gibbosus)], while those of all other markers and their combinations resulted in the topology [D. brevicornis, (D. asper, D. gibbosus)]. In the latter hypothesis the clade asper + gibbosus is also supported by structural synapomorphies.

This relationship is facultative for the partners. Preliminary field observations suggest a mutualistic interaction that represents an intermediate stage in the spectrum of formicid-hemipteran mutualisms. Behavioural adaptations of the leafhopper (no escape reaction) and the ants (no predation of leafhoppers, protection from spiders) are evident, but characters of advanced facultative mutualism such as physical contact between the partners or ant-triggered excretion of honeydew were not observed.

N2  - Host-ant specificity of Maculinea alcon, an endangered obligatory myrmecophilous lycaenid butterfly, was studied at two sites in southern Poland (Œwiêtokrzyskie Mts near Kielce). M. alcon larvae and pupae were found in nests of both Myrmica vandeli and M. scabrinodis, which is the typical host in Poland and Southern Europe. To our knowledge this is the first record of M. vandeli as a host of M. alcon. Our results show that M. scabrinodis and M. vandeli are about equally suitable as hosts. We hypothesize that both host ant species are closely related and have similar chemical profiles, and that the M. alcon "scabrinodis-vandeli” populations we studied belong to the M. alcon "scabrinodis” race. More than half of the M. alcon pupae, both from M. vandeli and M. scabrinodis nests, were parasitized by a single wasp species of the genus Ichneumon, which also suggests that the cuticular chemistry of the two ant species is similar.

N2  - Attraction of first instar larvae of Spodoptera litura to different colours was studied to determine those that could be used as effective visual attractants for trapping the larvae during dispersal. The larvae were presented with cones of coloured paper. Each cone was placed in the center of a 15-cm Petri dish around the edge of which the larvae were released. Percentage of larvae arriving at the cone was recorded at 5-min intervals over a 15-min period. Differences in the percentages reflected differences in larval attraction to the different colours. The larvae were highly attracted to Foliage Green, Green Bice and Cadmium Yellow. The larvae arrived at the Scarlet Red, Ultramarine Blue, Gray, Orange, White and Black cones in percentages that were almost equal, but lower than at the Foliage Green, Green Bice and Cadmium Yellow cones. Arrival of larvae at the coloured cones increased with time, but their relative preference for different colours remained the same. This study shows that green and yellow can be used as visual attractants in Spodoptera litura larval traps.

N2  - The grasshopper Dichroplus pratensis Bruner is polymorphic and polytypic for a complex Robertsonian system. In this species, centric fusions induce changes in number and position of chiasmata, and thus potentially affect intrachromosomal genetic recombination and genetic variability. Males and females, from 23 populations covering most of the geographic range of the species and spanning 22 degrees of latitude, were studied. We analyzed chiasma frequency in relation to variability in six exomorphological characters. The chromosomal polymorphisms of D. pratensis are widely geographically distributed, and show a central-marginal pattern, in which the central populations (those occupying the ecologically optimal habitats) have high mean frequencies of different fusions per individual (F) of up to F = 3.00 and total chiasma frequencies as low as XT = 8.98 per cell, while those near the margins of the distribution (central Patagonia and the Andes) have very low levels of chromosomal polymorphisms [down to F = 0.00 in most geographically marginal locations), monomorphic karyotypes and high chiasma frequencies (XT = 11.66, in the southernmost (Rada Tilly, 45°57´S) and XT = 12.01 in the northernmost population (Volcán, 23°55´S)]. Increasing chiasma frequencies towards the margins of the range are positively and significantly correlated with increasing levels of morphological variability. The decrease in fusion polymorphism and the consequent increase in genetic recombination (both inter- and intrachromosomal) in the marginal areas, is a result of natural selection favouring higher levels of variability, which could be adaptive in ecologically harsher and changing environments.

N2  - A cDNA encoding aminopeptidase N3 was cloned by degenerated PCR and RACE techniques. The full-length of APN3harm is 3486bp. Open reading frame is 3042bp in length, encoding 1014 amino acid residues. Its predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point are 117.04 kDa and 5.14, respectively. This deduced amino acid sequence shares some common structural features with aminopeptidase N from Lepidoptera, including the consensus zinc-binding motif HEXXHX18E and the GAMEN motif common to gluzincin aminopeptidases. The full-length of the APN3harm gene from three susceptible and three resistant strains were cloned and sequenced. Comparison analysis revealed fourteen amino acid differences in the APN3harm gene from resistant and susceptible strains and six mutations of amino acids exist in all resistant strains. It is possible that these mutations are related to the resistance of Helicoverpa armigera to Cry1Ac toxin. The results of semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed that the resistance of H. armigera to Cry1Ac is unrelated to the amount of APN3harm mRNA in midgut tissue. In susceptible strains, APN3harm is highly expressed in mid-gut, foregut and hindgut but not in other tissues. To determine if the APN3harm is the receptor of Cry1Ac, recombinant APN3harm protein was successfully expressed in E. coli. A ligand binding experiment showed purified product could bind Cry1Ac toxin. So it is proposed that APN3harm is a putative receptor of Cry1Ac in H. armigera. The sequence of APN3harm was deposited in GenBank with the accession number AY052651.

N2  - The role of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) in the metamorphosis of the central nervous system was investigated by recording feeding, wandering and pupariation behaviour as the measures of hormonal effects on the neural tissues in the flesh fly Neobellieria (Sarcophaga) bullata. The minimum amount of food essential for the commitment to metamorphosis is rather small and constant and the larvae ingest it during the first 4 to12 h of the last instar. Underfed larvae maintain food appetency for a certain time and this period of hunger can be considerably shortened by the application of 20E. Application of 20E also significantly shortens or abolishes the intake of additional food offered to starving larvae. Thus 20E has an effect on neural mechanisms controlling both termination of the period of hunger and suppression of feeding behaviour. Application of 20E at any time during the wandering stage stimulates the precocious onset of pupariation. The central neurons controlling motor patterns of pupariation behaviour are committed to perform properly their programme some 15 h earlier than the larval integument is ready to transform into normal puparium. As a result of this temporal shift of tissue determination, some precociously formed puparia are not properly shaped despite the fact that the larva is exhibiting normal patterns of pupariation behaviour.

N2  - Fenoxycarb is an insecticide with a juvenile hormone mimicking effect, which disturbs metamorphosis in several insect species, including the neuropteran Chrysoperla carnea. Administration of different doses of fenoxycarb to third instar larvae causes a dose dependent inhibition of metamorphosis and cocoon spinning. When treated within 48 h of the last larval ecdysis, this insect shows a temporary inhibition of metamorphosis and cocoon spinning, which leads to a prolongation of the third larval instar. When treated after 60 h into the last instar, most of larvae were unable to metamorphose and spin a cocoon. Thus, C. carnea is most sensitive to this juvenoid in the period after 60 h into the last larval instar.

Both ladybird species consumed most aphids, developed fastest and reproduced best when kept under white light, followed by yellow, blue and red light. Fitness of both the ladybirds was highest under white and lowest under red light. There were positive correlations between prey consumption and developmental rate, and prey consumption and fecundity.

N2  - The abundance of Coleoptera, Diptera and Collembola on different species of fungi was investigated in relation to the size and abundance of fungal resources at different spatial scales; i.e., the size of the fungal fruiting body, the quality of resource in terms of number of conspecific sporophores growing within a radius of 50 cm, crowding of the clumps of fruiting bodies, and the quality of resource within a plot (20 m × 30 m). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that the influential spatial scale varied among the arthropod orders. The amount of resource at the scale of a clump made a significant contribution to the abundance of Coleoptera, and the fruiting body size significantly affected the abundance of Diptera on each fungal species. Collembolan abundance was significantly affected by the crowding of the clumps of fruiting bodies and the number of fruiting bodies per plot. These results suggest that the spatial distribution of fungal fruiting bodies may determine whether they are selected by arthropods visited.

N2  - 1. In Great Britain the distribution of the riverine damselfly Calopteryx splendens is predominantly southern. However, the last decade has seen records of the species in previously unoccupied areas in the northeast of England, prompting speculation regarding northward range expansion. The current study is the first to quantify the physical features of the habitat that influence the presence of C. splendens.2. A field survey was carried out on the physical characteristics of habitat supporting C. splendens along a section of the River Wharfe, West Yorkshire, U.K. Adult C. splendens were marked uniquely for individual identification in order to assess the occurrence of the species within different habitat patches of the study area.3. A multiple logistic regression was used to identify the significant habitat variables in explaining the occurrence of adult C. splendens.4. The most important habitat factor in determining the presence of C. splendens was the height of the vegetation at the edge of the river. Significant negative relationships were found between the presence of C. splendens and tree coverage along the bank, and between its presence and increased bank height.5. The distribution of C. splendens is affected by the natural physical features of the habitat, anthropogenic disturbance and the behaviour of the species itself.6. The importance of quantitative habitat data in species conservation, particularly with regard to range expansion, is discussed.

N2  - Meaningful ecological studies on insect communities require sampling protocols that take into consideration temporal fluctuations in abundance and species composition. Bees with their specific requirements for nutrition and nesting are good indicators of landscape structure and overall biodiversity, provided the ecological and seasonal patterns they show are taken into consideration. The present two year study traced the ecological and seasonal patterns on 2 km2 of a southern slope in the Swiss Alps, ranging from 1150 to 1550 m above sea level. The study area consisted mainly of grassland under different regimes, mostly hay meadows and pastures. By direct netting at five monthly intervals in each year a total of 247 bee species were recorded. This comprehensive sampling scheme identified one of the most diverse bee faunas in Central and Northern Europe, consisting of a statistically estimated 280 species. Most species were rare with 14.6% represented by a single individual. Ecological analysis of the bee community showed that the primitively eusocial species were over represented among the abundant species and the parasitic species among the rarest.Both abundance and species richness were subject to marked seasonal variations. A substantial turnover in species composition as well as changes in ecological patterns were observed. More than 25% of all species were recorded in only one of the two years, in particular many of the parasitic species. Singletons accounted for a higher proportion when individual years rather than the pooled data were analysed. All these findings underline the importance of season-long sampling and sampling over more than one year if bees are to be used as indicators in ecological and studies on bee communities.

N2  - 1. A study was made by knockdown sampling and branch clipping of the arthropod fauna of the canopy of two native oak species (Quercus robur and Q. petraea) and of two introduced species (Q. cerris and Q. ilex ) in woods near Oxford, UK, and of two native species (Q. pubescens and Q. ilex) in southern France. Sampling was undertaken for five years in the UK and for four years in France. All the specimens from the UK, except Acarina, Collembola and Nematocera were identified to species or, occasionally, to morphotype.2. In terms of overall numbers, species richness and biomass, the results for Q. robur and Q. petraea in the UK were very similar. Their samples contained over three times the biomass and nearly double the number of species compared with those from the introduced oak species (Q. cerris and Q. ilex).3. The ordinal composition was very similar on Q. robur and Q. petraea, and that on Q. cerris showed closer concordance to the composition of these trees than to that of Q. ilex in the UK. The ordinal composition of the faunas of the two native oak species in France showed closer concordance to each other than to any of the oak species in the UK. The proportion of Psocoptera was much higher in the UK, and that of Thysanoptera was higher in France.4. The guild composition in terms of numbers, species richness and biomass were closely correlated on Q. robur and Q. petraea, and on Q. robur in two different woods, which argues for an underlying determinism in the development of community structure. The guild composition on the introduced species (Q. cerris and Q. ilex) was most closely correlated when expressed as species richness.5. The similarity of the guild composition on the oak species in the UK in terms of the actual species found was tested by a modified Sørensen’s Index. This showed that the guilds could be ranked in the following order of decreasing similarity: epiphyte fauna, tourists, scavengers, phytophages, parasitoids-predators.6. There were distinct seasonal patterns. In terms of species richness the values showed a general trend peaking in summer and early autumn, but biomass peaked in May on the native oak species, mainly due to Lepidopterous larvae. The ratio of prey to predator and parasitoid biomass had a distinct seasonal pattern, there being an excess of prey in May, but almost an equivalence throughout the rest of the season. This may reflect the high population of spiders in the late summer and autumn, which are likely to feed on tourists. Most classical ecosystem models do not allow for this latter important source of food that is not itself dependent on the communities’ habitat.7. The epiphyte dwelling guild (principally grazing Psocoptera) was a major component of the fauna in terms of numbers on the evergreen Q. ilex in UK. This has been reported for other studies of evergreen species in temperate climates.

N2  - The impact of transgenic Bt-maize, expressing the Cry1Ab protein, on aphids, leafhoppers, cutworms and wireworms was evaluated at the farm scale by comparing their abundance on Bt-plots and those sown with the isogenic variety over three consecutive growing seasons. The impact of Bt-maize was different on each of the three-herbivore groups. There were significantly more aphids on the Bt-maize but in terms of aphid species, the difference was only statistically significant for Sitobion avenae and not for the other three most abundant species (Metopolophium dirhodum, Rhopalosiphum padi and Macrosiphum euphorbiae). The analysis of aphid age structure showed consistently more individuals on Bt-plots; differences were significant for alates, apterous adults and young nymphs of R. padi, apterous adults and apterous fourth instar nymphs of S. avenae, alates, apterous adults and apterous fourth instar nymphs of M. dirhodum. Leafhoppers (Zyginidia scutellaris), particularly mature nymphs, were also more abundant on the Bt-maize. In spite of this there was no difference in leafhopper damage to Bt and non Bt-maize. The reasons for this are unclear but may be due to changes in Bt-maize that favoured aphids and leafhoppers. Differences in aphid and leafhopper densities were not high enough to affect yield. However, they may have affected the availability of prey for polyphagous predators such as Orius sp. The Bt-maize did not affect the incidence of cutworms (Agrotis segetum) or wireworms (Agriotes lineatus). These results indicate that Bt-maize does not have a negative impact on the non-target maize biocenosis at the farm scale.

In addition, males possess posterior sternal glands of the same structure on sternites 8 and 9. The tergal and the posterior sternal glands consist of four cell types: class 1 and class 2 secretory cells, and class 3 cells with corresponding canal cells. The cytoplasm of class 1 cells contains smooth endoplasmic reticulum, elongated mitochondria and numerous microtubules. Apical parts of these cells are formed by dense and long microvilli with a central ductule. Class 2 cells contain predominantly lucent vacuoles (in females) or lipid droplets (in males). The structure of class 3 cells does not differ from class 3 cells found in other body parts.

The cuticle of Rhysotritia duplicita (Euphtiracaroidea: Euphtiracaridae), Phthiracarus sp., Steganacarus magnus, S.striculus and Tropacarus carinatus (all Phthiracaroidea: Phthiracaridae) was studied by light and transmission electron microscopy. A combination of light and electron microscopy were used to precisely characterize and classify the cuticular layers in oribatid mites and show how they differe in mites and other arthropods. In Rhysotritia duplicata the cuticle of the aspis (upper shield of the prosoma) differs significantly from that of the opisthosoma. Moreover, prosomal cuticle in this species is different from that of all others species studied. There were no structural differences in the cuticle of the prosoma and opisthosoma of species of the superfamily Phthiracaroidea (Phthiracarus, Steganacarus and Tropacarus) in spite of the differences in external apparence. Moreover, in Tropacarus, the rough sculpturing of the cuticle results from the very rough exocuticle, which is unlike the thick smooth cerotegument of the cuticle in Steganacarus.

The blanchardi species group, proposed after a study of adult characters, is very important phylogenetically because it is a basal group in the genus and sister group to all the remaining groups. Larval characters confirm the monophyly of the group. The common larval characters of the blanchardi species group are: (i) presence of primary setae below the posterior row of terga, (ii) secondary microsculpture on the head, dense, present from the base of the head to the anterolateral arms of the epicranial suture and fronto-clypeal furrow, (iii) sclerotization around sockets of primary posterior setae of thorax of instar III, (iv) presence of clypeal furrow in the third stage, (v) presence of setae Dc1, Dd1, Dc2, Dd2a on head in instar III, (vi) urogomphomere 1 and 2 similar in length and proportion.

N2  - To re-evaluate the taxonomic status of Cheilosia canicularis (Panzer, 1801), C. himantopus (Panzer, 1798) and C. orthotricha Vujiæ & Claussen, 1994, variation in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and 18 nuclear allozyme genes were surveyed in allopatric and sympatric populations from Serbia and Montenegro. Genetic relationships among five populations of these species from the Fruška Gora (Serbia), Kopaonik (Serbia) and Durmitor (Montenegro) mountains were analyzed. Seven allozyme loci (Aat, Aco, Fum, Idh-1, Idh-2, Mdh-2 and Sdh) were diagnostic for delineating C. orthotricha from the other two species, while only a low, but consistent, genetic differentiation was observed between C. canicularis and C. himantopus. Differentiating all three species was possible based solely on the species-specific alleles at the Est-? locus. Sequence comparisons of 738 bp of the COI gene from eleven specimens was consistent with the variability in nuclear allozymes. Sequence data revealed variation in 5% of the nucleotide sites among C. orthotricha and the C. canicularis/C. himantopus pair, while less variation (0.68%) was observed within the pair C. canicularis/C. himantopus. However, the presence of one diagnostic allozyme locus and five consistently variable nucleotide sites in sympatric populations of C. canicularis and C. himantopus (Durmitor, Montenegro) suggest that these two species have separate gene pools.

N2  - Phylogenetic relationships among 16 genera of the subfamily Aphidiinae (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were investigated using sequence data from three genes: the mitochondrial large ribosomal subunit (16S), 18S ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial ATPase 6. All sequences were downloaded from the GenBank database. A total of 2775 base pairs of aligned sequence were obtained per species from these three genes. The results support the existence of three-tribes: Ephedrini, Praini and Aphidiini, with the Ephedrini occupying the basal position; Aphidiini could be further subdivided into three subtribes: Monoctonina, Trioxina and Aphidiina. The genus Aphidius is a paraphyletic group. The taxonomic status of the subfamily Aphidiinae within the Braconidae is probably closer to the non-cyclostome than the cyclostome subfamilies.

N2  - Membrane-bound proteases from preparations of the midgut of 5th instar velvetbean caterpillars, Anticarsia gemmatalis (Hübner) were obtained by resuspension of the pellet obtained after 100,000 g centrifugation. As expected of trypsin-like proteases, they hydrolyzed casein and the synthetic substrates N-a-benzoyl-L-Arg-p-nitroanilidine (L-BApNA) and N-a-p-tosyl-L-Arg methyl ester (L-TAME). Higher activities were observed at 50°C, and at pH 8.5 and 8.0 for both synthetic substrates L-BApNA and L-TAME. The membrane-bound proteases were inhibited by EDTA, phenylmethan sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), benzamidine and aprotinin. TLCK and benzamidine were particularly active inhibitors. The KM-values obtained were 0.23 mM for L-BApNA and 92.5 µM for L-TAME. These results provide evidence for the presence of membrane-bound trypsin-like proteases in the midgut of the velvetbean caterpillar, a key soybean pest in warm climates. The interaction between A. gemmatalis digestive proteases and soybean protease inhibitors has potentially important consequences for soybean breeding programs.

N2  - The black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, is polyphagous and its life cycle involves seasonal migration between summer and winter host plants. The aphids are regularly tended by honeydew-collecting ants. This study investigates whether differences exist in honeydew production and honeydew sugar composition for A. fabae subspecies feeding on various host plants and whether such differences reflect differences in the intensity of ant-atttendance (Lasius niger).A. f. fabae feeding on the perennial summer host, Tanacetum vulgare, produced twice the amount of honeydew (ca. 110 µg per aphid . h-1) than when feeding on the annual host plants Vicia faba or Chenopodium album. Honeydew production of A. f. cirsiiacanthoides feeding on the creeping thistle Cirsium arvense was the highest measured in this study (ca. 150 µg per aphid . h-1). Total sugar concentration in the honeydew of A. f. fabae did not differ when feeding on various summer hosts, whereas the honeydew of A. f. cirsiiacanthoides on C. arvense contained a significantly higher amount of total sugars. The trisaccharide melezitose was the dominant sugar in all the honeydew samples, except for the honeydew of A. f. fabae and A. f. evonymi feeding on the woody winter host plant Evonymus europaeus. The highest proportion of melezitose (80% of total sugars) was found in the honeydew of A. f. cirsiiacanthoides feeding on C. arvense. In this subspecies, the intensity of ant-attendance was also highest. The results confirm our hypothesis, that the sugar richness of the honeydew (rate of honeydew secretion × total sugar concentration) along with the presence of the attractant sugar melezitose are the critical factors in determining the extent of ant-attendance.In A. f. fabae feeding on the spindle tree E. europaeus, the total sugar concentration of the honeydew as well as the sugar composition differed significantly between generations.

N2  - Data on pupation and emergence dates for the nymphalid Purple Emperor butterfly Apatura iris have been collected at Basel, Switzerland, between 1982 and 2002. The butterfly has been shown to emerge on average 9 (males) to 12 (females) days earlier per decade, 19 and 24 days earlier respectively over the study period. Emergence dates relate strongly to spring temperatures, particularly with daily maximum temperatures for the months March to May. Temperatures for these months have increased significantly during this period (0.7°C to 1.8°C per decade). Three factors suggest that the strongest influence of the rise in spring temperatures has been on late larval instar growth and development: (i) May temperatures dominate emergence date models and larvae are feeding faster and for longer periods during this month, (ii) Salix caprea flowering date, a surrogate for bud burst, is excluded in stepwise regression models with temperatures and years suggesting that tree phenology may be less important than temperature effects on later development, and (iii) convergence of female and male emergence dates over time points to limits on earlier feeding in protandrous males. A negative consequence observed with earlier emergence dates is lethal extra broods.

N2  - Time of oviposition and investment in reproduction output are a crucial decision for animals which could affect their fitness. In this study, the factors determining the time of oviposition and the consequences it has for clutch size and juvenile survival were investigated in the orb-web spider Argiope bruennichi. Egg-sacs laid at different times in the field were collected and inspected for eggs, hatching success and presence of parasites. Relationships between spider body condition, clutch size and time of oviposition were established. The influence of supplementary food on the number of eggs in a clutch and on the time of oviposition was determined both in the field and laboratory. Early clutches were larger and the eggs in late clutches were not heavier than those in early clutches indicating that spiders invested more in eggs at the beginning of the reproductive period. Furthermore, eggs in late egg-sacs were less likely to hatch and more likely to be parasitized. Clutch size was linked to spider body condition but not the time of oviposition. In the field, additional food to females resulted in larger clutches but did not influence the time of oviposition. Laboratory experiments showed that the daily rate of prey consumption affected egg oviposition.

N2  - Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is one of the dominant plants of the Fennoscandian boreal coniferous forest and constitutes a major food source for many insect herbivores. A common ant species in these forests is the wood ant Formica (Formica) aquilonia Yarrow, which preys heavily on other invertebrates within its territories. The aim of this study was to investigate whether aquilonia’s predation on the insect herbivores may have indirect positive or negative effects on bilberry. Damage to the bilberry, its vegetative growth and reproduction were quantified in order to contrast localities close to (2 m) and far away from (50 m) ant nests.Close to ant nests, herbivore damage to the bilberry was significantly lower and reproductive success, i.e. proportion of flowers succeeding to berries, significantly higher. The results of this study therefore suggest that distance to aquilonia nests, and thus predation from ants, can significantly affect herbivore damage to the bilberry and its reproductive success (supporting the hypothesis of a top down effect in this three-trophic-level system). Vegetative growth, i.e., density and biomass of current year shoots, and reproductive investment, i.e., proportion of current year shoots with flower, of the bilberry was, however, not affected by distance to ant nests, indicating that the bilberry can also compensate for losses due to herbivory.

N2  - A laboratory study was carried out to determine the effects and interactions of temperature, host deprivation and adult feeding on the longevity of the parasitoid Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae). The effect of body size was also examined. Large wasps (hind tibia length > 1.96 mm) lived significantly longer than smaller conspecifics (hind tibia length < 1.89 mm). Adults reared at 15°C lived longer regardless of whether supplied with hosts or food. Correspondingly, adults had a shorter life at 30°C. Honey-fed adults lived significantly longer than starved adults at all temperatures and irrespective of host presence, while access to hosts resulted in a decrease in longevity at all temperatures, regardless of food supply. The Weibull distribution was used to describe the age specific survival, which in V. canescens is of \"Type I\", as the risk of death increases with age. Despite the significant effect of host presence on survival it was less than either temperature or feeding. The interactions between feeding, host presence and temperature proved to be significant. The objective of the study was to improve the effectiveness of V. canescens as a biological control agent of stored product pests.

N2  - Mate choice, reproductive success and fecundity of typical and melanic morphs of C. septempunctata were studied. Melanic as well as typical individuals preferred to mate with melanic males and females. Mate choice was mainly determined by females and to a lesser degree by males. Mating duration, oviposition period, and lifetime fecundity were highest (51.20 ± 2.82 min, 47.00 ± 2.79 days and 705.40 ± 69.85 eggs) when a melanic female mated with a melanic male and lowest (38.94 ± 1.68 min, 26.10 ± 2.54 days, 395.9 ± 36.25 eggs) when a typical female mated with a typical male. Longevity of both sexes of melanics was higher than of typicals. The fecundity function of both morphs was triangular but the daily oviposition was irregular. In melanic and typical females the peak oviposition (66.40 eggs/day and 48.30 eggs/day) occurred on the 23rd and 14th day of the oviposition period, respectively. Oviposition peaked earlier in typical females, but peak oviposition was higher and the oviposition period longer in melanic females. The higher reproductive success of melanics may favour this morph over typicals.

N2  - Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), the small and random departures from perfect symmetry of an organism’s bilateral traits, has been used as a measurement of developmental stability and an indicator of stress in endangered populations. We were interested in testing if the level of developmental stability is the same in different populations experiencing the same conditions, as the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress is only meaningful if this is true. In order to do this, the effect of thermal stress on wing size FA over a range of temperatures was determined on three different lines of Drosophila melanogaster: two lines were maintained at one of two different constant temperatures (18°C or 28°C) and one under a fluctuating thermal regime (18°C and 28°C) for eight years. The differences in viability of these lines, when reared at a range of different temperatures, are associated with the temperature conditions they previously experienced. All lines showed a similar increase in FA at the two ends of the thermal range but with significantly different mean values. The two units of wing development (compartments) differed in their FA response depending on the selective history of each line. We discuss the implication of our results for the use of FA as an indicator of ecological stress.

N2  - Host-plant mediation in ant-hemipteran mutualisms requires three conditions. First, hemipteran attractiveness to ants should vary with plant quality. Second, ants should preferentially tend those Hemiptera that produce the most nutritious attractant. Third, increased ant attendance based on a richer food reward should have a significant effect on some measure of hemipteran fitness. A field experiment is used to test these conditions. This is the first study to simultaneously test these three conditions, and the first to test the effect of plant flowering status on the ant-derived benefits for a honeydew-producing hemipteran. It is hypothesized that membracids (Guayaquila xiphias) feeding on plants (Didymopanax vinosum) with flowers ingest phloem sap of higher quality (higher sugar concentration), produce a higher-quality honeydew and, as a result, are attended by more ants and are better protected compared to those on plants without flowers. Total nitrogen content of the phloem sap of plants with or without flowers did not differ significantly, whereas the sugar concentration was higher in the sap of plants with flowers. Honeydew sugar concentration, honeydew production, and ant tending levels did not vary significantly with flowering status. Membracid survival increased, and natural enemy abundance decreased when ants were present. Plant flowering status did not affect the ant-derived protection afforded to treehoppers, but plants with flowers accumulated more natural enemies through time than plants without flowers. The results suggest that a trade-off between feeding on a higher-quality food and running increased risk of predation on flowering plants could underlie this ant-hemipteran interaction. Based on the parameters measured in this study it is concluded that host-plant mediation does not occur in the ant-Guayaquila system. The results suggest, however, that the way in which the host-plant could affect ant-Guayaquila interactions is complex and likely to involve other species.

N2  - Dispersal, fragmented landscapes, distance between fragments, mark-recapture experiments, ladybird, Eriopis connexaAbstract. Habitat fragmentation may affect the dispersal behaviour of individuals across the landscape. If there is a high boundary contrast between the remaining fragments and the matrix, individuals should tend to stay inside the fragments, but the configuration of the landscape, i.e. the level of fragmentation and isolation distance between fragments, may modulate this. To test these ideas, we made several mark-recapture experiments with the ladybird Eriopis connexa (Germ.) in manipulated alfalfa model landscapes (30 × 30 m). Specifically we evaluated (i) ladybird movement and permanence in alfalfa and bare ground areas, (ii) how they move across fragment/matrix boundaries, (iii) how their movement between fragments within a landscape is affected by fragmentation level and isolation distance, and (iv) how their permanence in the landscape is affected by fragmentation level and isolation distance. The fragmented alfalfa landscapes had a constant level of habitat loss (84%), but varied in the level of habitat fragmentation (4 or 16 fragments), and isolation distance between fragments (2 or 6 m). We also sampled aphid abundance in the different landscapes through time. We found that ladybirds stay longer and displace less in alfalfa than on bare ground, and that they move less from the alfalfa fragments to the neighbouring bare ground matrix than vice versa. At the landscape level, ladybirds had a higher inter-fragment movement when fragments were closer, they tended to remain in less fragmented landscapes, regardless of their isolation distance. Aphid abundance increased in time, but it was similar in all landscapes. Ladybird movement within fragments, in the matrix and in the boundary between both habitats explains why ladybirds concentrate within alfalfa fragments. However, their dispersal movements at the landscape level do not reflect the higher abundance sometimes found for several species of ladybirds in more fragmented landscapes. At this larger scale, other mechanisms may have a stronger influence in determining the abundance of ladybirds.

N2  - Species diversity and potential impact of cocoon parasitoids on the abundance of the common pine sawfly, Diprion pini L. (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae), were explored in different forest habitats, with endemic sawfly populations, by the regular exposure of laboratory reared sawfly cocoons. Different cocoon spinning sites of the sawfly were simulated by exposing cocoons at several strata (soil, litter, trunk and stem of pine trees) in a forest. In more fertile, mixed spruce/pine-forests, parasitism on exposed cocoons was lower than in typical outbreak stands with a lower vegetational diversity. The parasitoid communities comprised of up to nine parasitoid species, which showed temporal and spatial niche separation. The ichneumonid Pleolophus basizonus Grav. (Hymenoptera: Phygadeuontinae) occured throughout the season at all strata as well as in all forest types. The ichneumonid Gelis cursitans F. (Hymenoptera: Phygadeuontinae) was only found in pine forests with sparsely developed ground vegetation, parasitizing exposed cocoons in the upper story in spring. The torymids Monodontomerus dentipes Dalm. (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) and M. minor Ratz. (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) were present in all forest types, but parasitized commonly only cocoons in the upper story in summer. Apparently, these generalists can quickly respond to increased densities of upper story exposed "summer" cocoons and thus limit the population growth of the pine sawfly due to the development of a second generation.

N2  - Many gregarious insects aggregate in naturally occurring refuges on their host plants. However, when refuges are filled, they may be forced to aggregate on exposed areas of the plant. This study examines the effects of refuge saturation on group size and defence against parasitism in larvae of Ammalo helops Cramer (Lepidoptera: Arctiidae) that form day-resting groups on the trunks of weeping laurel, Ficus benjamina L., in El Salvador. Population densities, group sizes and parasitism were recorded on eight trees for each of four generations in 1995 and 1996. When population densities were low, all larvae were located in small groups in naturally occurring structural refuges (rotted out holes, spaces between crossing branches and under aerial roots) on the host plant. In contrast, when population densities were high and structural refuges were full, many larvae formed significantly larger groups (density refuges) on the open trunk. Between 20 and 24% of late-instar larvae were parasitized and this was inversely dependent on the size of within tree populations, in spite of populations being fragmented among structural refuges. Similarly, in a study carried out at a different location on young trees without structural refuges, parasitism of larvae was inversely related to group size. Although parasitism rates decreased with increasing group size, most larvae preferentially selected the small naturally occurring refuges, where groups were restricted to low densities. If this behaviour is an adaptive trait, I speculate that parasitism (or some other unmeasured mortality factor) is lower in naturally occurring refuges than in large open groups.

The specimens used in this study were collected with adults of G. jensenhaarupi and have been identified as such by association. Comparative notes on the morphology of these larvae with other species of the subfamily Ochthebiinae are given. A hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships between G. jensenhaarupi and other members of Ochthebiinae with thoroughly described larvae is presented. The monophyly of Ochthebiinae is supported by additional larval features. On the other hand Ochthebius, as currently composed, seems to by paraphyletic. Gymnochthebius Orchymont, 1943 is confirmed as the sister group of Aulacochthebius Kuwert, 1887.

N2  - External and internal head structures and external structures of the thorax and abdomen of larval representatives of Melandryidae (Orchesia), Ulodidae (Meryx), Oedemeridae (Pseudolycus) and Pythidae (Pytho) are described. The obtained data were compared to characters of other tenebrionoid larvae and to larval characters of other representatives of Cucujiformia. Characters potentially relevant for phylogenetic reconstruction are listed and were analysed cladistically. The data set is characterised by a high degree of homoplasy and the resolution of the strict consensus trees of 2650 or 815 (second analysis) minimal length trees is low. The monophyly of Tenebrionoidea is supported by several larval autapomorphies, e.g. posteriorly diverging gula, anteriorly shifted posterior tentorial arms, asymmetric mandibles and the origin of several bundles of M. tentoriopharyngalis from the well-developed gular ridges. Several features of the larval head are plesiomorphic compared to the cleroid-cucujoid lineage. The interrelationships of most tenebrionoid families not belonging to the pythid-salpingid and anthicid-scraptiid groups were not resolved. Synchroidae were placed as sister group of a clade comprising these two lineages and Prostomidae. A sistergroup relationship between Trictenotomidae and Pythidae seems to be well supported and the monophyly of the anthicid-scraptiid lineage was also confirmed. Another potential clade comprises Prostomidae, Mycteridae and Boridae, and possibly Pyrochroidae (s.str.) and Inopeplinae. The monophyly of Salpingidae (incl. Othniinae and Inopelinae) and Pyrochroidae (incl. Pedilinae) was not supported. Many features such as the shape of the head and body, sutures and ridges of the head capsule, the endocarina, the mandibles, the maxillary apex, and also characters of the terminal abdominal apex are highly variable, even within families. Especially the families Tetratomidae, Melandryidae, Colydiidae and Zopheridae show a high degree of variation in the larval stages. Several taxa appear isolated in terms of larval morphology within the families they are assigned to, e.g. Orchesia within Melandryidae, Sphindocis (Sphindocinae) within Ciidae, Calopus (Calopinae) within Oedemeridae and Penthe (Penthinae) within Tetratomidae. A broader spectrum of characters and a stepwise approach will be needed for a reliable clarification of the relationships within a very complex group like Tenebrionoidea.

N2  - In this paper a combination of characters by which Poecilimon species (Orthoptera: Tettigonioidea: Phaneropteridae) can be recognised as members of the P. sanctipauli group are described. Most important are the wide fastigium, short ovipositor and song characters. The morphological characters are figured and described (Table 1), and the song patterns illustrated by oscillograms. The proposed phylogenetic relationships of the members of this group are written as [P. mytilenensis (P. pulcher, P. lodosi, P. sanctipauli)]. All species of the group are known from southwest Turkey and some east Aegean islands. The three species P. pulcher, P. lodosi and P. sanctipauli are morphologically and bioacoustically quite similar. P. sanctipauli and P. pulcher are distinct species, P. lodosi, however, possesses a combination of the key characters of the other two species. It may be a relict species or, in our opinion more probably, a species of hybrid origin.

N2  - Both sexes of Achalcus bicolor sp.n., Achalcus longicercus sp.n., and Australachalcus latipennis sp.n. are described as additions to the Nearctic achalcine fauna. Diagnoses of five unnamed Achalcus species represented only by females are given. A key to Nearctic males and females including 10 unnamed species is provided. The new Achalcus records considerably extend the known distribution of the genus in North America, especially in the central and eastern states. Australachalcus latipennis sp.n. is the first known Nearctic species of this predominantly Neotropical and New Zealand genus. Achalcus bicolor sp.n. from Montana, Manitoba and Ontario clearly belongs to the Achalcus flavicollis species group. The eastern Achalcus longicercus sp.n. is not included in the latter species group due to the lack of a dorsal bristle on tibia I and the absence of a preapical anterodorsal bristle on femur III in both sexes. It features postgonites with strong hook-like apical processes possibly unique to this species. The presence and number of dorsal bristles on tibia I seem to be of both diagnostic and phylogenetic relevance. All northern achalcine species were collected between June and September, whereas some Californian species were taken in May and Australachalcus latipennis sp.n. from Arizona in October – November.

N2  - Aleurodicus dispersus Russell (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), a highly polyphagous species, has since the 90’s been an important pest of ornamentals and tropical crops in the Canary Islands. In this study the RAPD-PCR technique was used to study the genetic structure of this whitefly in this archipelago. A total of 68 different bands were scored in seven populations using six primers for amplification. No differences in RAPD patterns were found among populations from different islands of the Canaries. These findings indicate a very high genetic similarity among populations and low level of genetic variability and support a single colonization event by few A. dispersus whiteflies and recent dispersion throughout the archipelago.

N2  - Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is a worldwide pest of vegetable, ornamental and field crops. Biotype B of B. tabaci, which is economically most important of the biotypes, is distinct from all other biotypes (non-B biotypes). Fourteen populations of B. tabaci were collected from different localities and host plants in the Chinese mainland and Taiwan, namely TWYDH (tassel flower, Taiwan), HNYC (tobacco, Hainan), GXNG (pumpkin, Guangxi), GDYPH (poinsettia, Guangdong), GDBSM (croton, Guangdong), GDFS (Chinese hibiscus, Guangdong), SHYPH (poinsettia, Shanghai), FJGS (sweet potato, Fujian), SDFQ (tomato, Shandong), BJXHL (squash, Beijing), XJQZ (eggplant, Xinjiang), XJYPH (poinsettia, Xinjiang), XJJM (abutilon, Xinjiang) and XJMH (cotton, Xinjiang). The internally transcribed spacer 1 sequences (ITS1) of ribosomal DNA of B biotype and other biotypes were sequenced and analyzed. The B biotype-specific primers were then designed for rapid identification of B biotype of B. tabaci. The results show that the diagnostic primer only gave a positive result with the B biotype. This is the first report of a rapid means of identifying B. tabaci B biotype using a diagnostic primer based on ribosomal DNA. This protocol is especially useful for identifying the B biotype in Bemisia populations consisting of several biotypes.

N2  - Halobates spp. are the only insects inhabiting the open sea. One sea skater species, Halobates sericeus, was collected at 18 locations in the East China Sea area (27°10´N– 33°24´N, 124°57´E–129°30´E), and H. micans and/or H. germanus at only 8 locations in the area south of 29°47´N, where water temperatures were more than 25°C. At three locations, where the water temperature was less than 23°C, neither H. micans nor H. germanus were caught. The effect of photoperiod on the aggregation and mating behaviour of the sea skater, H. sericeus, was studied under laboratory conditions during a one-month cruise. Adults and 5th instar larvae of H. sericeus, collected between 29°02´N and 30°29´N, were kept under long (14.5L : 9.5D) or short-day (10.5L : 13.5D) conditions at 23 ± 2°C for 20 days. Aggregation and mating behaviour of these sea skaters were recorded over a period of 150 min during the daytime. To analyze the data, the observation period of 150 min was divided into 50 intervals of 3 min. Aggregation was observed more under short than long-days. Duration of a group was much longer under the short (mean ± SD : 43.0 ± 108.1 sec) than long-days (7.6 ± 3.1 sec).

An absence of the functional pair for 12 h had no affect on the development of new neotenics, whereas 24-h absence induced the development of new neotenics in 5 out of 12 experimental groups. A 48-h absence induced development of new neotenics in all 12 experimental groups. Pseudergates and nymphs can be orphaned for up to 12 h a day without being stimulated to differentiate, after which the number of new neotenics increased gradually with the time for which the reproductive pair was absent. This suggests that the inhibitory process is continuous and cumulative. Both sexes showed similar sensitivity to the absence of reproductives. The study also tested, by exchanging pseudergates between groups with functional pairs and orphaned groups, whether pseudergates in experimental groups actively spread inhibitory factors; however, this was not proven. Only pseudergates and nymphs that were in direct contact with the functional pair were inhibited.

N2  - Seasonal adaptations of green lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) and their role in the control of aphid populations are discussed. The chrysopids of temperate zones face seasonal changes and must escape cyclic adversity. One way is via the number of broods per year. Most green lacewings are facultatively multivoltine, with the succession of generations most often regulated by photomediated diapause. Others are univoltine and some extend their life-cycle to two years in cold or dry environments. Synchronization is an important feature of seasonality, often starting in spring. In univoltine species, it is sometimes the result of subtle mechanisms, such as double contradictory signals (short plus long day lengths) for reactivation in spring, or a multi-receptivity of the preimaginal instars to photoperiod throughout a year, combined with photo-controlled and synchronized egg laying in late summer. Only one North American species is known to enter a surnumerary food-mediated diapause in summer. Every postembryonic instar may undergo diapause depending on the species. The timing and impact of the spring resumption in aphid consumption depends on their overwintering strategy.As far is known, chrysopids are intolerant of freezing, but their supercooling points are low enough to enable them to endure hard frost. The numbers of overwintering specimens of green lacewings in the field depend on the structure of the assemblages in the previous growing season. Three examples are used to show that the overwintering populations are different in the different biotopes and dependent on the way the dominant species overwinter. Artificial chambers proposed for overwintering adults of common green lacewings afford them protection during diapause and enhance their predatory efficiency in spring.

N2  - The main influences on the specificity of hoverfly larvae (Diptera: Syrphidae) to particular aphids are outlined. There are four main ones: aphid species, host plant, parasitoid impact and the presence of ants. Studies in the literature are used to illustrate the effect of these factors on larval performance. The use of single components of fitness as measures of performance can be misleading: only \"individual fitness\" includes all the appropriate components of survival, development time and reproduction. Even generalists appear to choose among aphids on the basis of expected fitness. A new level of complexity is therefore required in studies of food specificity in predatory syrphids.

N2  - The community of predators within agroecosystems has the potential to restrict aphid populations, especially early in the season before exponential increases in density and prior to the arrival of specialist natural enemies. Although direct observations of predation, laboratory feeding trials and manipulative field studies have been used to estimate levels of biological control exerted by different species (or potentially negative interactions between them), it is often difficult to extrapolate results to naturally occurring interactions in the field.Over 100 investigations have utilized gut-content analysis to estimate aphid predation rates by predators. Throughout the last century, gut dissection, which enables the visual identification of aphid body parts, has been used in over 50% of studies although accurate identification and quantification of predation is difficult. Other techniques have included radio-labelling of prey, dissection of faecal samples, electrophoresis, stable isotope analysis and use of polyclonal antisera. In recent studies of invertebrate predation, monoclonal antibodies have been the most frequently applied technique but advances in molecular biology have enabled the detection of species-specific DNA sequences. The use of these applications to quantify predation by aphidophagous predators will be reviewed, with emphasis on potential sources of error and difficulties of quantitative interpretation. Despite the considerable focus currently directed towards molecular approaches, antibody-based techniques are likely to remain an important tool for studying predation rates of pests in the field, especially when antibodies have already been developed. However, the study of multiple predation events within complex generalist predator food webs is only likely through the detection of species-specific DNA sequences using molecular techniques.

N2  - Since the publication of papers by Polis et al. (1989, 1992), intraguild predation (IGP) has been considered in numerous systems and a growing number of papers have been published, demonstrating the ubiquity and the importance of this interaction. It appears that aphidophagous guilds constitute especially favourable systems for IGP. Temporal and spatial distributions of aphids promote interactions, such as IGP, among natural enemies. However, despite extensive laboratory and field studies, several questions remain to be answered: Which traits of the different protagonists of the system may promote or hamper the occurrence of IGP? How do ants tending aphids modulate the interaction? How should one consider the \"sub-lethal\" effects (and the defensive mechanisms) associated with the risk of IGP? May IGP disrupt or enhance aphid control? These different issues are discussed by focusing on the predatory species in the complex system of aphidophagous guilds. It appears that, first, IGP may constitute one of the main forces influencing the structure and dynamics of aphidophagous guilds, and therefore it has to be taken into account in research studies, and second, because of the ephemeral nature of aphid colonies and the great number of species belonging to aphidophagous guilds, understanding all the implications of the interaction, both direct and indirect, constitutes a very complex task.

N2  - Knowledge of semiochemically-mediated behavioural mechanisms of the seven-spot ladybird, Coccinella septempunctata L., is limited but sufficient to encourage further studies in the behavioural ecology of this well known insect. Recent findings on semiochemicals are discussed in relation to the main traits in the ecology of C. septempunctata. A putative autumn aggregation pheromone, and effects of allelobiotic plant interactions on habitat preferences of adults are reported. Mechanisms for interaction between an aphid alarm pheromone and plant substances are described, and the kairomonal functions of volatiles from C. septempunctata on the parasitoid Dinocampus coccinellae (Schrank) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) are discussed. Considering the polyphagous diet of C. septempunctata, investigations on the importance of associative learning of chemical cues in foraging behaviour, and further studies on interactions with other third trophic level organisms will provide interesting lines of research.

N2  - The paper reviews existing data on the food quality of cereal aphids for generalist predators. Data are presented for spiders, harvestmen, carabid and staphylinid beetles, cockroaches, ants and one species of bird. All results agree that cereal aphids are low-quality food compared to alternative prey types (in most studies fruit flies). This is associated both with a low consumption capacity for aphids and a low utilization efficiency of the aphid food. A pure aphid diet allows full juvenile development in only a few species. Aphids as part of mixed diets can have negative, neutral or positive effects, which depends on the quality of the remaining diet. The low consumption capacity for aphids is due to the development of a specific feeding aversion. Genetic variation in the ability to tolerate aphids has been documented, indicating that predators may be able to adapt to a higher proportion of aphids in the diet in areas where outbreaks are frequent. A consequence of these findings is that predator populations rely on alternative prey (e.g. Collembola and Diptera) for maintenance and reproduction, and are probably unable to benefit nutritionally from an aphid outbreak. The low food quality of aphids to generalist predators explains why generalist and specialist predators have widely different roles in aphid biocontrol, but does not rule out that under some conditions the generalists may be able to inhibit aphid population growth sufficiently to prevent an outbreak, as field experiments have indicated. Simulation modelling shows that a low consumption capacity for aphids has little influence on the ability to prevent aphid population increase at low aphid immigration rates, but a great influence at high aphid immigration rates. Modelling also indicates that there may be an optimal availability of high-quality alternative prey that maximizes the impact of generalist predators on aphid population growth.

N2  - Empirical protocols for assessing the suitability of prey for aphidophagous coccinellids are examined and a modified scheme of categorization is presented. It is argued that prey suitability should be assessed independently for larval development and adult reproduction because of potentially divergent nutritional requirements between these life stages. A scheme is proposed for assessing prey suitability for larval development using conspecific eggs as a reference diet against which diets of various prey types can be compared both within and among coccinellid species. Among suitable prey (those that support ca. 100% survival of larvae to the adult stage), those that promote faster development and yield larger adults relative to a conspecific egg diet are considered "optimal” for larvae. Prey that yield viable adults with similar or reduced adult weight after a similar or extended period of development relative to a diet of conspecific eggs are classified as "adequate”. Prey are "marginal” if they support the survival of some larvae, but significantly less than 100%. Supplementary water should be provided with any non-aphid diet (e.g. pollen and alternative sources of animal protein) given the potential for food-specific diet-drought stress interactions. For adults, suitable prey are classified as "adequate” if they support the production of viable eggs when fed as a monotypic diet, or "marginal” if they merely prolong adult life relative to a water source. Prey that comprise an optimal or adequate diet for both larval development and adult reproduction are termed "complete” and these can be indexed for relative suitability according to derived estimates of rm. Potential sources of error in diet evaluation studies are identified and discussed.

N2  - Many areas of biology employ standard model organisms on which a majority of research effort is concentrated. However, there is invariably a danger associated with the use of too few or atypical models for studies of particular taxonomic groups, guilds or biological phenomena. Using aphidophagous ladybirds, I show that in this group, in the last ten years, 69% of research has been concentrated on just five species, all generalist ecotypes. Much research is now concentrated on invasive species, originally biocontrol agents, and over half the aphidophagous ladybird work on intraguild interactions is centred on two of the five predominant species, Coccinella septempunctata and Harmonia axyridis. Using examples from differing areas of research, I show that studies of more unusual, non-commercial specialists can enhance our understanding of the commonly studied groups. I suggest further areas where a similar approach may lead to equally illuminating results.

N2  - A tobacco field in Greece was sampled during the 2001 and 2002 growing seasons to assess the seasonal trends in densities and spatial distributions of the aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and its predatory mirid Macrolophus costalis (Fieber). On repeated occasions between June (just after the transplantation) and September (just before harvest), 20 tobacco leaves (10 from the upper and 10 from the lower plant part) were taken from randomly chosen plants. These leaves were sampled for aphids and mirids. In both years, the highest aphid densities were recorded during July and August, while aphid numbers were low in September. In contrast, the majority of M. costalis individuals were found during September when aphid numbers were low. Significantly more M. persicae individuals were found in the upper part of the plants, whereas significantly more M. costalis individuals were found in the lower part of the plants. As indicated by Taylor’s Power Law estimates, both species were aggregated in their spatial distributions among sampling units (leaves). Wilson and Room’s model, based on the Taylor’s estimates, was used to calculate the mean number of aphids and mirids, from the proportion of sampling units (leaves) that had > 0 individuals of each species. This model provided a satisfactory fit of the data for both the aphid and the mirid. In addition, Wilson and Room’s model was successfully used to predict the mean number of aphids and mirids in a series of samples that were carried out in the same area between June and September 2003 for model validation. Finally, equations are given for the calculation of precision in estimating the mean number of aphids or mirids per sampling unit, and the required sample size for a given level of precision.

N2  - The duration of the increase, peak and decline in abundance of the immature stages of sycamore and cereal aphids each year is ephemeral. These temporary resources are exploited by a sequence of aphidophagous insect predators. The temporal sequence in the appearance of the immature stages of coccinellids and syrphids in the sycamore and cereal aphid systems is defined. In spring in the sycamore aphid system and early summer in the cereal aphid system the immature stages of syrphids consistently appeared before those of coccinellids. In the case of the sycamore aphid the autumnal peak in abundance was on average larger than the spring peak, and although attacked by more syrphids, it was not exploited by coccinellids. These temporal patterns in the attack sequence are associated with a difference in the lower developmental thresholds (LDT) of these two groups of predators. The LDT of syrphids (4°C) enables them to be active at lower temperatures and to develop faster between 10° and 27°C than coccinellids, whose LDT is 10°C. As a consequence, early in the year, when temperatures are low but increasing, syrphids appear before and complete their development more quickly than coccinellids, and in the latter half of the year, when temperatures are generally lower and decreasing, only syrphids are likely to be able to complete their development before the aphids disappear. Thus, the niche shift between syrphids and coccinellids is possibly more a consequence of a phylogenetic constraint than a response to competition and or intraguild predation. The relevance of these findings for the ecology of intraguild predation is discussed.

N2  - Interactions between syrphid predators and their prey are poorly known. The adaptations of syrphids to aphid defences and the consequences for the evolution of life history traits in these predators especially are mostly unstudied. This is the first of two papers investigating the evolution of prey specialization in aphidophagous hoverflies. The study focuses on two questions: (1) Are differences in the body size of syrphid predators reflected in differences in the size of their prey? (2) Are differences in body size, body mass and development time of the syrphid predators correlated with the defence strategies of their aphid prey (e.g. mobility, toxicity)? Platycheirus clypeatus (Meigen, 1822), Platycheirus fulviventris (Macquart, 1829), Melanostoma mellinum (Linnaeus, 1758), and Melanostoma scalare (Fabricius, 1794), which differ considerably in their prey specialization, but are closely related, were chosen as model species. Life history data for these syrphids came from a laboratory study, and that for the aphids from a literature survey. These syrphid species can be arranged on a gradient of increasing prey specialization, from 32 prey species for the generalist M. mellinum and only 3 for the specialist P. fulviventris. Differences in prey specialization were even more evident when the defence ability of the various species of aphid prey was considered. For instance, the specialization on ant-attended aphids in M. scalare. Larvae exhibited a one or two weeks diapause which made the determination of developmental time imprecise. Body size of the predators was not reflected in that of their aphid prey. The postulated relationship between body size of the predator and the defence strategies of their prey was not supported by our data. A comparison of a wider range of syrphid species from different taxonomic groupings together with a phylogenetic correction procedure might reveal clearer trends. The second part of this paper (Dziock, in prep.) will investigate the correlation between prey specialization and reproductive strategies (i.e. clutch size, egg size and number) and will put the results into a broader framework.

N2  - For polyphagous predators, the link between food consumption and reproduction is not always straightforward, and instead may reflect that even predators with very broad diets may have reproductive tactics that are tied to consumption of a restricted range of prey. We studied the consumption and use of two prey species for reproduction by the ladybird, Harmonia axyridis Pallas. This polyphagous predator feeds on both pea aphids [Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris)] and larvae of the alfalfa weevil [Hypera postica (Gyllenhal)] that it encounters when foraging in alfalfa fields. When provided a diet of pea aphids or of alfalfa weevils and/or sugar water, females of H. axyridis laid eggs in large numbers only on the diet of aphids. Females laid no eggs on diets of weevils or sugar alone, and laid only small numbers of eggs when the two foods were provided together. When placed on a diet of aphids, females began laying eggs earlier, and laid more eggs altogether, when they had previously fed on weevils versus sugar water. The predators’ consumption rates of aphids were greater than their consumption rates of weevils, and they produced less frass per mg of prey consumed on an aphid versus weevil diet. The predators searched more actively when maintained on a weevil versus aphid diet. Hence, lower rates of food intake and assimilation, and greater allocation of nutrients and energy to searching, appear to contribute to the reduced egg production of H. axyridis females that feed on weevils versus aphids. Alfalfa weevils are also less suitable prey than pea aphids for larval survival and development of H. axyridis. Thus, the differing responses of H. axyridis adults to these two prey types may reflect that these predators are well adapted in the linking of their feeding and reproductive behavior.

N2  - The foraging behaviour of beneficials such as aphidophagous predators depend largely on volatile compounds emitted by potential preys. Even if polyphagous predatory species are considered, all the potential preys are not systematically localised and accepted. In this work, chemical cues from different aphids and plants, each alone or in association, were studied to elucidate their role in prey location. Using a four-arm olfactometer, attraction of combinations of three aphid (Megoura viciae, Acyrthosiphon pisum and Aphis fabae) and one plant (Vicia faba) species for Episyrphus balteatus larvae was observed. Predatory hoverfly larvae were attracted by all tested stimuli in the presence of aphids, whatever the species. Whole or crushed aphids and also aphids on bean plant parts were attractive to syrphid larvae, but the host plant alone did not present any infochemical role for E. balteatus. Identification and quantification of the volatile releases from aphid and plant species, alone or in association, were performed using SPME and GC-MS methods. Aphid alarm pheromone, (E)-b-farnesene, was found in the volatile pattern of each aphid and was tested for its role as an effective kairomone for the hoverfly.

N2  - In central Europe Adalia bipunctata (L.) occurs in two main colour morphs (typical, melanic), and A. decempunctata (L.) occurs in 3 morphs (spotted, chequered, dark). Temporal variation in the relative frequency of morphs was recorded in populations of the Czech Republic where geographic variation in morph frequency is low. Seasonal trends were investigated in samples collected by a light-trap run daily from March to November for 14 years. In A. bipunctata the melanic form was more abundant in autumn than in spring but the difference was not significant. In A. decempunctata morph proportions did not change seasonally. Samples were also collected by sweepnet from stands of many plant species. In both Adalia species the morph proportions did not differ significantly among collections made on different plants. Long-term changes in morph proportions were analysed by pooling annual samples over all host plants. In A. bipunctata, sampled in 15 years between 1971–2004, there was no significant change in proportion of typical (90.1%) and melanic (9.9%) forms. In A. decempunctata, sampled in 12 years between 1976–2004, the proportions of \"spotted\" (mean over the years 29.4%), \"chequered\" (42.2%) and \"dark\" (21.3%) morphs varied between years. There was a trend toward an increasing proportion of the spotted form in the 2000s compared to the 1970s and 1980s.

N2  - Since 1978, the abundance of Coccinella septempunctata L. has been recorded at a hibernation site in the western Czech Republic. Over the years, abundance varied by two orders of magnitude and a long-term trend for decrease in C. septempunctata abundance was observed beginning in the early 1990s. This recession was correlated with the decreasing abundance of its dominant prey, cereal aphids. The acreage of small grain cereals and other crops suitable for breeding C. septempunctata populations also decreased. The change in abundance of cereal aphids may be associated with a dramatic decrease in fertilizer input after 1990. Decreasing fertilizer use has changed the quality of small grain cereal crops and is reflected in lower yields.

N2  - One of the factors affecting the effectiveness of predatory coccinellids in an aphid infested crop is the food specificity of the predator. The response towards six species of aphids (Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae) was therefore tested in one of the most abundant aphidophagous coccinellids in Bulgaria – Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). All aphid species studied (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, Aphis craccivora Koch, Eucallipterus tiliae (L.), Euceraphis betulae (L.), Phorodon humuli (Schrank) and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) cultured on transgenic Bt and conventional (non-Bt) potatoes were suitable food according to the rate of larval development, larval mortality and adult fresh weight. Females of P. quatuordecimpunctata fed with M. persicae cultured on Bt potato, or on non-Bt potato or on a mixture of M. persicae from Bt potatoes and A. craccivora, laid a little more eggs than those fed only with A. craccivora.

N2  - The aestivo-hibernation in central Greece of the aphidophagous ladybeetle Hippodamia (Semiadalia) undecimnotata (Schneider) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was studied. H. undecimnotata is a multivoltine species in Greece. In the lowlands, all instars are abundant in spring, becoming scarce from July until the end of October and they are absent in winter. In June, most H. undecimnotata adults migrate to mountainous aestivo-hibernation sites. The duration of pre-oviposition period in females sampled monthly from the summits of the mountains Chlomo and Kitheron in central Greece and transferred to laboratory conditions of high temperature (25°C), long day (16L : 8D), and abundance of aphids (Aphis fabae), indicated that the H. undecimnotata females were in diapause during July and August. The diapause gradually terminated from late August to late October and was followed by a period of quiescence extending from November to March of the following year. During the summer diapause, arrested ovarian development was indicated by the undifferentiated state of the ovaries in all females. Males and females had enlarged fat bodies, and the median preoviposition period after the transfer to the laboratory was 92 days in early July and 64 days in early August. During the winter quiescence, arrested ovarian development was characterized by immature ovaries in females and, in some samples, by vitellogenic resorption in a few females. In winter, adults contained varying amounts of fat body reserves, and the median preoviposition period of females transferred to breeding conditions was 30 days in early November and 16 days in mid January.

N2  - During the past four decades, several species of aphidophagous Coccinellidae became established in North America, including Coccinella septempunctata, Harmonia axyridis, Hippodamia variegata, and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata. After their establishment, unknown circumstances favoured a rapid increase in population densities and distribution of H. axyridis and C. septempunctata at localities hundreds and thousands of kilometers from their release sites. Propylea quatuordecimpunctata and Hippodamia variegata have spread more slowly after becoming established in northeastern North America. Comparative studies based upon allozyme variation in these four introduced species and in six native North American species of ladybird beetles revealed no significant differences in genetic diversities. Genetic variation, assessed by allelic diversity and heterozygosity, was uncorrelated with the establishment and spread of these predatory species in North America. All ladybirds studied show a remarkable degree of dispersion with little detectable population subdivision.

N2  - We examined the influence of offspring mortality caused by hyperparasitism on the secondary sex ratio of Lysiphlebus hirticornis Mackauer, a solitary endoparasitoid of the aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride Stroyan, in the field. Females of L. hirticornis produce pseudo-gregarious broods, which may comprise more than 200 offspring. Hyperparasitoids [mainly Syrphophagus aphidivorus (Mayr)] attacked and killed up to 60% of the primary parasitoids inside mummified aphids, especially late in the season. Hyperparasitized broods were larger than hyperparasitoid-free broods, which suggests that the risk of hyperparasitism increased with mummy density. We tested the hypothesis that mortality caused by hyperparasitism is greater for female than male offspring of L. hirticornis. If mummy quality scales with mummy size, hyperparasitoids should choose the relatively larger over the relatively smaller mummies. In the absence of hyperparasitism, broods of L. hirticornis included approximately two daughters for each son; the sex ratio did not vary with brood size. In hyperparasitized broods, the sex ratio was nearly even. This result indicates that relatively more female offspring (developing in the larger mummies) than male offspring (developing in the smaller mummies) were killed by hyperparasitoids. We propose that sex-differential offspring mortality in L. hirticornis is the result of differences in optimal host choice between the primary parasitoid and the hyperparasitoids.

N2  - In the High Plains of western Kansas, USA, the convergent lady beetle Hippodamia convergens Guérin completes a spring generation feeding on cereal aphids in winter wheat before leaving fields in large numbers around the time of harvest. In late May, large aggregations of coccinellids form on wild sunflowers, Helianthus annuus, and certain other weeds, that appear to serve as important sources of water absorption for the beetles, and other beneficial insects, during the dry prairie summer. Adult beetles were collected from sunflower plants and held in four treatments: (1) access to water only, (2) access to sunflower stalks only, (3) eggs of Ephestia kuehniella provided ad libitum + water and, (4) greenbug, Schizaphis graminum Rondani provided ad libitum. Most females fed greenbug matured eggs in less than a week and only a few entered reproductive diapause. In contrast, more than half of the females fed Ephestia eggs, an inferior diet, entered reproductive diapause, and those that matured eggs required an average of almost three weeks to do so. Time to 50% mortality was 7 days for beetles receiving only water, and 12 days for those receiving only sunflower stalks, whereupon all survivors were fed greenbug. Even after feeding on greenbugs for a month, less than half of the surviving females in these two treatments produced eggs. We conclude that reproductive diapause is an important adaptation for improving H. convergens survival during summer when aphids are scarce, although females will forgo diapause if they have continuous access to high quality prey.

N2  - Markers are essential to study movements of insects in their natural habitat. Among the available techniques, trace elements may be applied to insects as small as parasitoids. Rubidium is the most common element used for marking insects. In this study, we propose a simple marking technique for Aphidius rhopalosiphi De Stefani Perez with Rb, when reared on the grain aphid Sitobion avenae Fabricius (Hemiptera: Aphididae) marked on a RbCl incorporated diet. Our results show that the rubidium in an artificial diet is transferred to the aphid and eventually to the parasitoid. The content in rubidium marking did not differ between genders. The aphids stung by a marked parasitoid could not be distinguished from unmarked aphids on the basis of their rubidium content. There were no effects of rubidium on size, fecundity, longevity and sex ratio of the parasitoid, but the marked individuals emerged significantly later than the unmarked. We did not detect differences concerning host acceptance by marked and unmarked parasitoids. This technique may be applicable to other aphidophagous insects after some preliminary evaluations.

N2  - Investigations of the interactions between aphids and ants in multispecies ant communities and an experimental investigation of some ethological aspects of ant-aphid interactions were carried out in mixed forests at Novosibirsk Academic Centre, from 1998–2002. The eight species of ants investigated were characterized by different levels of territorial organization and interaction with aphids, which were associated with different degrees of specialization of the worker ants. The most myrmecophilous species of aphids (24 out of 33 species identified) were associated with the red wood ants. By placing Coccinella septempunctata Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in aphid colonies it was shown that only ants with large protected territories attacked the adults and larvae of the predator. Other species of ants either protected aphids only from adult ladybirds or did not guard them at all. Moreover, only individuals of Formica s. str., which has specialized workers, did not switch to collecting protein food. However, aphids make up a considerable part of the prey of ants, in which non-myrmecophilous aphids predominate (about 60–100% of the aphid prey). Moreover, ants only killed unattended or damaged myrmecophilous aphids. Formica s. str., which has the highest level of social and territorial organization, provides aphids with the most services and is the dominant species forming symbiotic relationships with aphids in the communities studied.

Four conditions were used: (1) fully fed for 24 h, (2) 24-h starvation, (3) 48-h starvation, and (4) 24-h starvation followed by 24-h re-feeding. Body length and initial body weight were not significantly related to the number of ovarioles per female. Both starvation conditions significantly increased the percentage of oosorptive individuals and ovarioles per female, and significantly decreased the percentage of mature ovarioles per female. Re-feeding for 24 h after a 24-h starvation resulted in a significantly higher percentage of mature ovarioles per female; however, the percentage of mature ovarioles remained lower than in the fully fed condition. Oosorption mainly occurred during the intermediate developmental stage of the ovarioles. The rates of ovarian development and oosorption in predatory H. axyridis were much faster compared with those in herbivorous ladybird beetles. Body length, initial body weight, and the number of ovarioles were significantly correlated with the number of eggs laid during the last 24 h of each experimental condition. From an analysis of the weight loss and the number of eggs laid during the last 24 h of each experimental condition, it appears that the realized weight of the eggs may be directly determined by the amount of food digested by the adult. The ovarian development and oosorption were asymmetric in the right and left ovaries. These may be important strategies for oviposition in H. axyridis, because selective provision of maturing ovarioles in the right or left ovary with digested nutrients would favor their development. In addition, the energy loss through oosorption during the intermediate developmental stage of oocytes would be less than the energy loss resulting from the resorption of mature oocytes. Therefore, one role of the ovary in H. axyridis, in addition to egg production, might be as a kind of energy storage system for increasing reproductive success. An immediate start of ovarian development under favorable feeding conditions and rapid oosorption during food scarcities may be an adaptive ovipositional and survival strategy for female adults of H. axyridis in response to heterogeneous and fluctuating resource conditions.

N2  - The role of relatedness and diet in kin recognition was investigated in the aphidophagous ladybirds Propylea dissecta and Coccinella transversalis. Third instar larvae of both species exhibited kin recognition, as they were reluctant to consume related first instar larvae. They spent significantly more time prior to cannibalism when interacting with genetically related victims; this indicates the presence of a kin recognition system. Kin recognition, however, was not evident in fourth instar larvae as they ate both related and unrelated victims. This result reveals that the need of fourth instar larvae to attain a critical weight for pupation might subdue kin recognition. The diet of cannibals did not affect cannibalism, number of encounters or time that elapsed prior to cannibalism. This indicates that kin recognition is not dependent on exogenous cues derived from the diets of the cannibal and victim.

N2  - The relative occurrence and seasonal abundance of aphidophagous predators (Insecta and Arachnida) were determined in alfalfa fields at two locations in the northeast Iberian Peninsula, using D-Vac and sweep-net sampling techniques. Among the insects, Heteroptera, Dermaptera, Neuroptera, Coleoptera and Diptera were found. The relative abundance of predators was similar at the two locations. Polyphagous predators were much more abundant than aphid specific species. Heteroptera were the most abundant order of insect predators: members of the Nabidae, Anthocoridae and Miridae were very common. Coleoptera were also abundant, represented mainly by the family Staphylinidae. Coccinellidae were less abundant and their occurrence coincided with maximum aphid presence. There was a low occurrence of other aphid-specific predators, i.e. Diptera: Syrphidae and Neuroptera: Chrysopidae. Arachnida varied between localities (from 35% to 65%). Over a five-year period, numerical responses by Orius spp., Nabis provencalis and Coccinellidae to aphids were found using polynomial regression models; however the abundance of predators was weakly explained by aphid abundance. Alfalfa, maize and winter cereals share similar aphid predator groups and these crops partially coincide in time, enabling the movement of predators among crops. The persistence of several predatory groups (Anthocoridae, Nabidae, Staphylinidae, Araneae) during most of the season suggests that alfalfa plays a major role as a reservoir of aphid predators.

N2  - The aim of this study was to clarify the diet of Ceratomegilla notata (Laicharting), a common species in different mountain habitats of the Palearctic region. In Italy it is found only in alpine ecosystems between 800–1700 m. In these areas, up to 1200 m, various crops (e.g., maize, potatoes) are present. The high meadows are cut for hay. From 2002 to 2003 investigations on the foraging behaviour of this ladybird were carried out in mountain habitats (six near Villabassa, in Bolzano province, and six near Soraga, in Trento province) and in the "Paradisia” Botanic Garden (Gran Paradiso National Park). C. notata adults and larvae were found on the flowering plants, especially those infested by aphids. The study of their diet was done taking random D-Vac samples of 20 adults and 20 larvae/habitat every 15 days, between July and September. The influence of the haymaking on C. notata populations was also evaluated.In agricultural fields the ladybirds prey on Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), R. padi (L.) on maize and on Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) and Therioaphis luteola (Born.) on Trifolium pratense L. In the natural pastures, adults and larvae feed on Cavariella theobaldi G. & B. found on Heracleum sphondylium (Umbelliferae), Sitobion avenae L. on Avena sativa L., Megoura viciae (B.) and A. pisum on Vicia cracca L., Uroleucon jaceae (L.) on Cirsium arvense Scop., U. cichorii (Koch) on Hypochaeris radicata L. and Macrosiphum weberi Born. on Scabiosa sp. A study of the gut contents revealed the presence of aphids, Umbelliferae pollens and spores of fungi (e.g., Alternaria spp., Helminthosporium spp., Puccinia spp.). Statistically significant associations between different food sources were more frequent for adults than for larvae in both 2002 and 2003. Thrips are an important prey of this ladybird in the absence of aphids. C. notata is an important aphidophagous species in Alpine habitats.

N2  - The research on pre-diapause feeding of C. septempunctata L. adults was carried out from 1998 to 2002 in the Tiber Valley, in the Botanical Garden of Perugia University, and in the Sibillini Mountains National Park (Central Italy). The species reproduces in spring feeding mostly on aphids infesting Graminaceae. In the second half of June, newly emerged adults have various migratory behaviours. Some of them remain in the valley while some leave the cereals and fly to other crops, where they feed both on 15 aphid species (e.g., Aphis gossypii Glov. on melon, Aphis fabae Scop. on sugarbeet), and also on pollens of wild plants such as Carduus nutans L., and fungi spores. However, most of the adults migrate to mountain pastures to find different food sources. During this migration, strong south-western storms often force the ladybirds to shelter in urban habitats. When the sunny weather returns again, due to the mistral (north-western wind), the adults continue the flight in swarms to mountain areas. In 1999, on Mt. Vettore (2478 m) we witnessed a "shower” of ladybirds, some of which hid in the turf. When reaching high altitude locations still covered with snow (Lake Pilato, 1940 m, on Mt. Vettore), the adults, exhausted by the long flight, usually remain motionless on the snow. Due to the warming of the sun they sink to a depth of 5–6 cm, so that they remain trapped in the frozen snow during the night. At this site C. septempunctata was found together with Vibidia duodecimguttata (Poda) and Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say). We investigated the gut content of adults from this location. After aggregation, the hungry adults disperse to flowering plants at lower elevations where they feed on 8 aphid species (e.g. broom aphid) and pollens of several plants (e.g., Laserpitium garganicum Tem., Centaurea rupestris L., Cachrys ferulacea L. The first mating was observed on broom. At "Pian Grande” location, adults were found in crop fields (lentil, mustard) and wild pastures (cornflower, gentian) mating and feeding on aphids, pollens, nectar and fungal spores. Haymaking forces ladybirds to move towards higher locations in search of food. Echinops ritro L., Eryngium amethystinum L., Carlina acaulis L., Cirsium eriophorum (L.), Galium verum L. and Euphorbia cyparissias L. were major food sources at 1800 m altitude. Gut content of C. septempunctata adults showed that pre-diapause diet consisted of aphids, pollen of Compositae and Umbelliferae, and spores of fungi (e.g., Alternaria spp., Cladosporium spp.). There was no statistical difference between the number of adults containing remains of aphids, fungal spores, and pollens. We found four significant correlations between the different food sources observed. In August some adults stopped feeding and in diapause condition sheltered under stones and among leaves or seed capsules of plants where they had fed. Others migrated to nearby woods and aggregated between juniper needles.

N2  - We studied the importance of forest structure (shape, edge length and orientation) and the crop mosaic (percentage of crops in the total land cover, within 100 and 2000 m from the forests) to the dynamics of an aphidophagous hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus. Adults were collected by Malaise traps located within and on the south- and north-facing edges of 54 forests. In winter, E. balteatus was only found on south-facing edges because of the greater insolation and temperature. In summer, it was more abundant on north-facing edges because of the abundant presence of flowers. In spring, more adults were found on long and south-facing edges than on northern edges. The presence of shrubs within 2000 m also positively affected abundance. In autumn, abundance was positively associated with length of the north-facing edge and forest shape. Emergence traps revealed that in southern France, E. balteatus may overwinter in the larval or puparial stage in forest edges. Overwintering was earlier reported only in adults. Landscape structure, length of forest edges and probably presence of shrub fallows, influence abundance of Episyrphus balteatus.

N2  - Winglessness in the two-spot ladybird beetle Adalia bipunctata (L.) is determined by a single locus with the wingless allele recessive to the winged wildtype allele. The expression of the wingless trait is highly variable, with individuals missing a variable part of elytra and flight wings; the elytra and wings appear to be truncated rather than miniature in form. The degree of winglessness is partly determined genetically. Here we report on the phenotypic plasticity of the degree of winglessness. The environmental effect on elytron length relative to maximal elytron length in wingless phenotypes was studied by rearing offspring of single pair crosses of this form at a low (19°C) or high (29°C) temperature. Offspring reared at 19°C showed relatively longer elytra than those reared at 29°C.

N2  - We used the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi reared in its host Acyrthosiphon pisum to examine if male sexual attractive responses can be conditioned to an odour (vanilla) that is not present in the natural environment. We used prior mating experience (exposure to females) as a non-conditioning stimulus and vanilla odour as a conditioning stimulus. The behavioural responses were tested in a glass Y-olfactometer just after eclosion (i.e., initial response) and after a training experience (i.e., trained response). During the 10-min training period individual males were allowed to copulate with a virgin female with or without vanilla odour present, or were exposed only to vanilla odour. Wing fanning was a recurrent behaviour which denoted increased sexual attraction to a volatile stimulus. Total time and time doing wing fanning in each olfactometer arm were determined. Vanilla odour, which initially did not elicit sexual-related behaviours, triggered strong sexual attractive responses when males were trained to females plus vanilla odour. Neither copulation only nor vanilla odour only treatments elicited such behaviours in trained males. The results are discussed in terms of parasitoid learning ability and its ecological consequences.

N2  - Overwintering insects must avoid injury and death from the freezing of tissues and from metabolic disruptions associated with exposure to low, non-freezing temperatures. The winter climates of the world are classified in relation to insect overwintering on the basis of their minimum temperatures and the duration of the winter (when temperatures are below the thermal range for activity and development). Outside the Tropical Wet zone, the severity of exposure to cold (temperature, snowfall, duration of exposure, predictability, variability) can vary from a few days at 0°C to months below –20°C with extremes as low as –60°C. The severity of the temperature exposure may be ameliorated by the selection by insects of overwintering sites (exposed, partly-exposed, protected). The relationships among overwintering habitats, the minimum winter temperature in climatic zones, and the supercooling points (SCP) of over 350 terrestrial insects from published reports were examined. Variability in the SCP among insects within each climatic zone and habitat was wide. Among the freeze-susceptible species that overwintered in exposed or partly-protected habitats the SCP and the cold severity of climate were correlated. This was not the case for insects that overwintered in protected habitats. The SCP’s of freeze-tolerant insects were generally higher than the freeze-susceptible insects, and the SCP’s were not tightly linked with the cold severity of climatic zone. Insects, both freeze-susceptible and freeze-tolerant, overwintering in exposed habitats had lower SCP’s than insects from habitats that offered some protection from ambient temperatures. Thirty-eight species had reports of SCP’s for different geographical locations. Although there were occasionally differences in the SCP’s, there was no consistent pattern of insects having lower SCP’s when overwintering in colder habitats. The incidence of freeze-tolerance was higher in boreal and polar climatic zones than in climatic zones with warmer winters. Holometabola insects had a higher incidence of freeze-tolerance than hemimetabola insects. Suggestions for future research directions are outlined.

N2  - Species of the Agrilus viridis-complex and the genus Trachys are morphologically difficult to identify or even indistinguishable. However, all of them are ecologically clearly separated because their larvae develop in different host plants. Hitherto, it was unclear whether they represent varieties, ecological races or true species. In this paper the genetic variation and phylogenetic relationships within these groups are analysed using partial sequence data from mitochondrial genes (12S rDNA, and a fragment containing regions of ND1 and 16S rDNA). The phylogenetic analyses yielded largely congruent tree topologies and indicate that all species and varieties of the Agrilus viridis-complex belong to a monophyletic group, which is closely related to A. cuprescens. Compared to all other Agrilus-species tested, the genetic distances within the A. viridis-complex are very small. However, all varieties and species are clearly separated. Thus, our data support the view that both the members of the Agrilus viridis-complex and the species of the Trachys-group represent genetically separated taxa.

N2  - The sterrhine loopers Timandra griseata and T. comae have been treated as distinct species since 1994. However, morphological differences between the taxa are minor and therefore their status has often been disputed. Here, we present a molecular phylogenetic study, which separates T. griseata and T. comae into different clades. Altogether, 43 Timandra specimens from eight European countries were studied. The phylogeny is based on a comparative sequence analysis of mitochondrial genes coding for the cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND1). Nevertheless, a single individual of both species was assigned to the "wrong" clade. The symplesiomorphy of T. griseata and T. comae is considered to be a result of introgressive hybridization. Conditions that could lead to the hybridization of T. griseata and T. comae are discussed, as well as the likely distribution history of these taxa in Northern Europe. Results of the current analysis are in favour of retaining the species status of T. griseata and T. comae.

N2  - The methylated H3 histone and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are markers of heterochromatin in several eukaryotes possessing monocentric chromosomes. In order to confirm that these epigenetic markers of heterochromatin are evolutionary conserved, the distribution of methylated H3 histones and HP1 homologues on the holocentric chromosomes of the cabbage moth Mamestra brassicae (Lepidoptera) were studied. In particular, PCR experiments with degenerated primers identified a HP1 homologue (called MbHP1) in the M. brassicae genome. Sequencing showed that the MbHP1 gene is 737 bp long including a 102 bp 5’UTR and a 635 bp coding portion (comprising an 80 bp intron). The MbHP1 peptide consisted of 184 amino acids, had a 20 kDa molecular mass and a net negative charge. At the structural level, it showed an N terminal chromo-domain and a chromo-shadow- -domain at the C terminus linked by a short hinge region. At the cytogenetic level, MbHP1 was located exclusively in the heterochromatic regions of the chromosomes. The same heterochromatic regions became labelled after immuno-staining with antibodies against H3 histone methylated at lysine 9, reinforcing the hypothesis that this modified histone is essential for HP1 binding. Our data, as a whole, confirm that heterochromatic components and markers are evolutionary conserved both in mono- and holocentric chromosomes despite the difference in the distribution of heterochromatin on chromosomes.

N2  - Geographic subspecies of several ithomiine butterflies on the lower east Andean slopes display a black and orange "melanic tiger" aposematic wing pattern that occurs from Colombia to Bolivia, while geographically adjacent lowland subspecies typically bear a coloured, "tiger" pattern. However, it is not clear whether subspecies with similar wing patterns in different regions have arisen through independent events of convergent adaptation, possibly through parapatric differentiation, or result from allopatric differentiation, as proposed by the refuge hypothesis. Here, we examine geographic patterns of divergence in the widespread and common ithomiine butterfly Hyposcada anchiala. We present phylogenetic hypotheses for 5 subspecies of H. anchiala, based on 1567 bp mitochondrial DNA. All topologies indicated that a single switch in mimetic pattern best explained the wing patterning of the H. anchiala studied here. This finding suggests that the subspecies of H. anchiala studied here result from at least two stages of differentiation, and is consistent with a single colonisation into a novel altitudinal zone coincident with a wing pattern switch, followed by subsequent divergence within, rather than across altitudinal zones. The subspecies divergences indicated diversifications were consistent with the Pleistocene. Furthermore, the lowland subspecies were more recently derived than the montane taxa, in contrast to predictions of the "Andean species pump" hypothesis.

N2  - When investigating sexual strategies of aphids, it is necessary to set up multiple replicates to compensate for the small number of eggs laid per female. Genetic variation among replicates can be minimised if members of the same clone are used, but problems can arise unless the participants are also physiologically equivalent. A series of experiments on Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was performed to investigate aspects of male maturation and semen transfer that should be considered in planning or interpreting experiments on aphid sexual strategies.

N2  - The systemic effects of phytoecdysteroids were investigated by applying tested compounds to the roots of the rape plants. Evaluation of the effects was based on mortality, longevity, rate of development and fecundity of the cabbage aphid (Brevicoryne brassicae L., Sternorrhyncha: Aphididae) feeding on the shoot of the treated plants. The major ecdysteroid compounds tested were natural products isolated from a medicinal plant Leuzea carthamoides DC (Willd.) Iljin (Asteraceae): 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), ajugasterone C (ajuC) and polypodine B (polyB). The compounds were tested in two concentrations (0.07 and 0.007 mg/ml) in water. In addition, we have also investigated the systemic effects of a special Lc-Ecdy 8 fraction isolated from L. carthamoides, which contained 20E, ajuC and polyB and at least six other minor compounds in addition to the above indicated ecdysteroids. HPLC analysis of the Lc-Ecdy 8 fraction indicated the presence of makisterone A and inokosterone in minor quantities. It appeared that all ecdysteroid compounds tested, with the exception of the most common, 20E, decreased the fecundity of cabbage aphids which fed on the contaminated rape plants. The mortality of larvae and adults significantly increased on plants treated with the Lc-Ecdy 8 fraction, and with ajuC or polyB compounds containing structural substituents in rather unusual positions. The most common phytoecdysteroid, 20E, with the typical and characteristic ecdysteroid structure, was the best tolerated of all phytoecdysteroids tested.

N2  - The semiochemical relationships in a predator-prey-host plant system were studied by a series of multiple-choice field assays. The studied system included predatory flies of the genus Medetera (Diptera: Dolichopodidae), the bark beetles Ips typographus and Pityogenes chalcographus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) as prey and Norwegian spruce (Picea abies) as the host plant. Of the nine species of predators collected, only M.setiventris and M.melancholica provided sufficient data for statistical analysis. The response of the predators to monoterpenic products of the host (alpha-pinene, limonene, camphor), pheromone compounds of I.typographus (S-cis-verbenol and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol) and a mixture of the pheromones of I.typographus and P.chalcographus were investigated. Our field trials revealed that tree volatiles plus pheromones of the prey, and a pheromone mixture of both prey species were considerably more attractive to M.setiventris and M. melancholica than the individual chemicals. Medetera seem to respond to the stage of tree decay and the intensity of bark beetle infestation via the ratios of tree volatiles and/or prey pheromones.

N2  - This paper presents data on the activity rhythms of the Brazilian cave cricket, Strinatia brevipennis. Recordings were made in the laboratory in a sound-proof constant environment. Recordings were made either under constant darkness or LD cycles, with food provided ad libitum or not, and with crickets isolated or with a conspecific near the cage. Some crickets were tested with pulses of sound. Raw data are presented in the form of single plot actograms and analyzed using the phase weighted stack (PWS) method. These cave crickets showed a somewhat erratic patterns of activity, although a circadian component could be detected. All the environmental variants tested (food availability, presence of conspecific and sound pulses) seemed to mask any activity rhythm indicating they are possibly important in determining the temporal organization of these crickets. Their activity patterns are discussed in terms of the plasticity of a cave animal’s circadian system.

N2  - The uzifly, Exorista sorbillans (Diptera: Tachinidae), a parasite of the silkworm, Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae), causes heavy losses to the silk industry. This parasitoid harbours a Wolbachia endosymbiont, which controls the fly’s reproduction. In the present study a method for curtailing this notorious pest by administering Wolbachia-targeted tetracycline via its silkworm host’s diet is investigated. Tetracycline not only influenced the larval growth of the silkworms’ by decreasing larval duration, increased silk production and fecundity, without affecting hatchability, it also decreased the reproductive fitness of the uzifly endoparasite by killing the Wolbachia. The antibiotic exerts a beneficial influence by affecting the intestinal flora of silkworm larvae. On the other hand the reproductive fitness of uzifly was greatly reduced in terms of different reproductive abnormalities. When male and female flies that emerged from treated host silkworms were crossed and males from untreated hosts and females from treated hosts were crossed, approximately 72% and 97% of the eggs failed to hatch, respectively. However, of the eggs from crosses between male and female flies that emerged from untreated hosts and between males from treated hosts with females from untreated hosts, an average of 30% failed to hatch and the Wolbachia infection enhanced the fecundity of uziflies. These results demonstrate that the Wolbachia may be essential for uzifly reproduction and that Wolbachia-targeted antibiotics have a beneficial influence on silkworm growth while decreasing the reproductive fitness of the uzifly, E. sorbillans.

N2  - The hypothesis that small body size is correlated with preference for young leaves was tested in a community of leaf-chewing insect herbivores feeding on Ficus wassa in a humid tropical forest in Papua New Guinea. Feeding experiments on 48 species of herbivorous insects revealed a negative correlation between body size and a preference for feeding on young leaves. While small species preferred young leaves, large species showed no preferences, or preferred young leaves only slightly. This relationship was found for the entire leaf-chewing community, as well as for many of the constituent taxa on several taxonomic levels, from orders to genera. Taxonomic position of a species played little role in determining its preferences. It is proposed that higher toughness and lower nutrient content may act as complementary defences, which prevent small insects from feeding on mature foliage. While the low nutrient content of mature leaves may affect smaller herbivores due to their relatively higher metabolic rate and lower digestion efficiency, their toughness complicates feeding mechanically and may prevent the compensatory feeding necessary to offset the low nutritive value of mature leaves.

N2  - In 1996, an old forest pasture grazed from the 1960s to 1988 was restored by coppicing, fencing and grazing by cattle to protect a local population of the endangered butterfly Euphydryas aurinia. An adjoining ungrazed meadow provided a control. In the first years, the butterfly became almost extinct due to the nearly complete consumption of the host plant of the larva, Succisa pratensis, by cattle. The butterfly population quickly recovered when the grazing pressure was lowered. Thus, the intensity of management should be adjusted by continuous monitoring of the target species. In the 2000s, the annual population was about 50 butterflies, but marked fluctuations took place, probably caused by natural factors. Grazing benefited the meadow flora and improved the habitat of butterflies in general. Extensive forest grazing clearly has the potential for enhancing biodiversity. The value of the experiment is, however, limited because only a single pair of meadows was available for comparison. In the future, it will be even more difficult to arrange a similar experiment due to the great decline in the numbers of traditional meadows and forest grazing in SE Finland.

N2  - Coptotermes gestroi and Heterotermes tenuis (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) are important pests in southeastern Brazil causing serious economic damage. In this study we determined the demographic patterns and foraging activity of these species using mark-release-recapture and the consumption of wooden stakes. Using both the weighted mean and Lincoln index methods, population estimates ranged from » 0.57 to 1.99 million individuals for C. gestroi and from » 0.20 to 1.37 million for H. tenuis. Territory size of the colonies ranged from 172.5 to 5235 m2 for C. gestroi and from 16 to 40 m2 for H. tenuis. Our results also indicate that foraging activity was dependent on the minimum temperature; however, the existence of a compensation strategy in the foraging activities may permit foragers to exploit food sources under different environmental conditions.

N2  - Continent-wide loss of traditionally managed humid meadows is raising concern for associated butterfly specialists across Europe. However, not all species associated with this biotope are threatened, and the Lesser Marbled Fritillary (Brenthis ino) has even spread locally. We employed mark-recapture and transect walks to study its population structure and patterns of landscape occupancy in a hilly region of western Bohemia, Central Europe, to determine which life history or demography traits might be responsible for its success. A population studied by mark-recapture harboured more than 1000 individuals and was interconnected with other populations. This was further supported by a fit of the inverse power function to dispersal data. Observations of adult behaviour revealed a broad host plant range: at least three species of plants were used by the single population. On a landscape scale, the butterfly exhibited an aggregated distribution matching its host plants. It was associated with the distribution of characteristic plants and butterflies of semi-natural humid meadows, but its frequency exceeded those of other humid grasslands specialists. The relatively broad host range coupled with varying biotope requirements of individual host plant species results in a wide biotope range for the butterfly, explaining its persistence in fragmented Central European landscapes.

N2  - Mating success is linked to reproductive success in males, but parameters influencing it are poorly known. The relationships between lifetime mating success (LMS), fluctuating asymmetry (FA), body size (SIZE), reproductive period (RP) and emergence date (MD) of males of Cercion lindeni were investigated. Males were marked and photographed in their pre-reproductive period, and their matings monitored. RP was assumed to be the period between the MD and the last sighting of each individual. Three different FA measures and the size of each individual were determined. The results showed that the individuals not present at the pond during the reproductive period had a higher FA (but not for meristic characters) than those present. For those individuals actually involved in reproductive activity, LMS was only positively correlated with RP, which was negatively related with MD, and this with SIZE.

N2  - Larvae of three genera representing the staphylinid subfamily Pseudopsinae are described for the first time and illustrated with 33 morphological drawings: Pseudopsis Newman, Zalobius LeConte and Nanobius Herman. Thirty-six characters (mainly of larval morphology) were scored for representatives of six staphylinid subfamilies and a phylogenetic analysis was carried out. The monophyly of the subfamily Pseudopsinae is supported by the presence of a short oblique ridge on ventral side of larval head capsule laterad of maxillary foramina. The monophyly of each of the subfamilies Paederinae and Staphylininae is discussed based on the characters of the immature stages. The subfamily Pseudopsinae is confirmed to be a sister-group of the subfamilies Paederinae + Staphylininae on the basis of six larval synapomorphies. The latter clade is confirmed to be monophyletic on the basis of five larval synapomorphies. A larval identification key to the studied Pseudopsinae genera is provided.

N2  - Beetle luciferase, a mono-oxygenase within the AMP-binding superfamily, is synthesized by bioluminescent beetles in concentrated levels within specialised cells clustering in the abdominal light organs. In vivo expression of luciferase has been rarely investigated and little is known about the role of enhancers and promoters in the expression of this gene. In order to investigate the gene structure and potential control of gene expression the luciferase gene along with 6 kb of upstream genomic sequence was characterised from the European glow-worm Lampyris noctiluca. Three TATA box motifs and a CAAT repeat were identified, two of these were found to be conserved in two other species of bioluminescent beetle. Although no enhancer regions were identified in the upstream sequence a region coding for a putative transposase DDE domain was identified 686 bp from the start codon of the luciferase gene. Although disrupted, the open reading frame also shared extensive identity to an mRNA transcript from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. The remnants of an ancient transposase provide support for an ancestral luciferase transposition/insertion event that may have occurred within the genome of bioluminescent beetles.

Abundance and the percentage of positive responses to E. pingüis obtained using ELISA showed spiders to be the main predator, especially in 1998, when they accounted for 18% of the predation, followed by Scymnus suturalis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) and Brachinotocoris ferreri (Heteroptera: Miridae).

N2  - The natural prey of the jumping spider Menemerus taeniatus (L. Koch, 1867) was studied on the Absheron Peninsula, Azerbaijan. The percentage of specimens of M. taeniatus found feeding was low (10.7%). This investigation showed that M. taeniatus is a polyphagous predator feeding on a wide range of arthropods, including representatives of eight arthropod orders. The primary food of M. taeniatus was Diptera and Lepidoptera, which collectively made up about two thirds of total prey. The length of prey killed by M. taeniatus ranged between 1.10 and 13.00 mm (mean 6.14 mm), which is between 15.2 and 216.7% (mean 90.3%) of the length of their captors. Most frequently taken prey (50%) were medium-sized arthropods varying between 50–100% of the spiders’ body length.

N2  - At a nest site in Northern Italy of females of the weevil-hunting digger wasp Cerceris arenaria L. (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) the provisioning activity and predator-prey relationship were investigated, in particular their specialization in choice of prey. Females were active from middle of June to end of July, and from 8.00 to 19.00. The wasps made provisioning flights throughout the day, mostly in late morning and early afternoon. Individual wasps generally only hunted for 1 or 2 prey species of all those available, maybe because of their higher abundance. The size of prey, which is positively correlated with that of the female wasps, seems to be the main factor determining choice of prey. The nature of the provisioning flights seems to be related to the size of the prey, being more frequent and shorter for smaller weevils. The correlation between prey and wasp biomass is discussed in relation to the size range of the wasps.

N2  - The suitability of Liriomyza sativae Blanchard, L. trifolii (Burgess) and L. bryoniae (Kaltenbach) as hosts of the solitary larval-pupal parasitoid Dacnusa sibirica Telenga was studied. This parasitoid is used as a biological control agent against L. trifolii and L. bryoniae. The parasitoid laid eggs in L. sativae, but no adult parasitoids emerged from the puparia. In contrast, D. sibirica adults emerged from the puparia of L. trifolii and L. bryoniae, and there was no significant difference in emergence rate, female developmental time, or sex ratio when parasitizing these two host species. The parasitoid adults that emerged from the L. bryoniae puparia were significantly larger than those from L. trifolii puparia. In conclusion, D. sibirica, a useful biological control agent of L. trifolii and L. bryoniae, cannot control L. sativae.

N2  - Data on nesting densities of Bembix rostrata, a digger wasp inhabiting dynamic coastal dunes, were used to document the detrimental effects of trampling by cattle and vacationers. Both types of disturbance resulted in similar sand displacement and prey availability. Nesting densities of Europe’s largest digger wasp declined dramatically with increasing trampling, probably below the critical population size. Hence, additional human disturbance, although resulting in similar environmental conditions compared to natural disturbance, significantly affected local population sizes. As a result, anthropogenic has to be avoided disturbance in order to restore or conserve natural dynamics and efforts to restore natural dynamics in a more natural way should be promoted. Although this is here only documented for one, large specialised invertebrate, the application of traditional management techniques, such as grazing by large herbivores, within newly evolved landscapes may introduce new pressures that affect pre-adapted species to natural disturbances negatively within short time spans.

N2  - Many aphidophagous coccinellids harbour male-killing bacteria. These maternally inherited bacteria kill males early in embryogenesis, female offspring of infected mothers gaining a large resource advantage from the consumption of their dead brothers. In this paper, the diversity of male-killing bacteria and their coccinellid hosts will be briefly reviewed. Thereafter, the impact that invasion by male-killers has on coccinellid hosts will be addressed in two ways. First, the selective effects due to the loss of male progeny, and the intra-genomic conflict resulting from the cytoplasmic inheritance of the bacteria will be considered. Reductions in mitochondrial diversity, effects on clutch sizes and the evolution of male-killer suppresser systems will be discussed. Second, the impact of female biased population sex ratios on the evolution of reproductive strategies and the primary sex ratio will be investigated. Preliminary results suggesting changes in male investment per copulation, reductions in female testing behaviour of males, and male biases in the progenic sex ratios of some uninfected male lines will be presented. Avenues for future work will be outlined.

N2  - The Coreidae (Heteroptera) have holokinetic chromosomes and during male meiosis the autosomal bivalents segregate reductionally at anaphase I while the sex chromosomes do so equationally. The modal diploid chromosome number of the family is 2n = 21, with a pair of m-chromosomes and an X0/XX sex chromosome system. A 2n = 24/26 (male/female) and an X1X20/X1X1X2X2 sex chromosome system were found in Spartocera batatas (Fabricius). C-banding and fluorescent-banding revealed the presence of AT-rich heterochromatic bands medially located on all the autosomes, and one telomeric band on both the X1 and X2 chromosomes. This banding pattern differed from the telomeric heterochromatin distribution found in most other heteropteran species. The X1 and X2 chromosomes were intimately associated during male meiosis and difficult to recognize as two separate entities. Based on a comparison with the behaviour of sex chromosomes in other coreids and other heteopterans with multiple sex chromosomes it is suggested that the particular behaviour of X1 and X2 chromosomes in coreid species with multiple sex chromosome systems evolved as an alternative mechanism for ensuring the proper segregation of the sex chromosomes during meiosis.

N2  - Reversal of heartbeat was monitored in vivo by noninvasive, multisensor, thermo-cardiographic and pulse-light, opto-cardiographic techniques. The dorsal vessel was sectioned at the beginning, in the middle and near the end of the abdomen. Changes in the heartbeat were simultaneously monitored in both the disconnected anterior and posterior sections of the heart. The results revealed the existence of a caudal regulatory cardiac centre located in the fused A7–A10 abdominal segments. Posterior sections, containing this terminal ampulla of the heart always exhibited a more or less normal heartbeat reversal, including both anterograde and retrograde pulsations. This shows that the forward-oriented as well as the reciprocal, backward-oriented peristaltic waves of the heart are both regulated from the posterior regulatory center, without involvement of the cephalic region. The cardiac pulsations in the anterior sections of the heart were paralysed and seriously impaired by the lesions. During the acute phase after the lesions, anterior sections showed only some convulsion-like, unidirectional, backward-oriented peristaltic pulsations of low frequency. Within one or two days after the lesions, isolated anterior sections of the heart developed a subsidiary heartbeat regulation associated with the oscillating, bi-directional peristaltic waves running alternatively, forward and backward in opposite directions.After a few days, the previously paralysed anterior sections of the heart were able to develop perfectly coordinated patterns of heartbeat reversal. At this time, the two asynchronous heartbeat patterns ran separately in each of the divided sections of the heart. One or two weeks later, reversal of the heartbeat occasionally occurred synchronously along the entire length of the dorsal vessel. Sectioning of the ventral nerve cord, removal of the cephalic nervous system (brain, frontal ganglion, suboesophageal ganglion and the associated nerves) or removal of the fused terminal abdominal ganglionic mass and adjacent caudal nerves, had no effect on the pattern of heartbeat reversal. These facts indicate that the pupal heart of M. sexta operates purely myogenically, like the human heart. The myogenic pacemakers of the caudal regulatory cardiac centre (analogous to the atrio-ventricular nodes of the human heart) are autonomous, generating inherent rhythmicity without intervention from the nervous system. Development of subsidiary pacemakers regulating rhythmicity in the lesioned myocardium and restitution of the synchronized contracting integrity between the two disconnected sections of the heart are new cardiological features, which merit further investigation.

N2  - In the present study the temporal changes in the volume of the corpus allatum in three experimental groups of adult males (macropterous, reproductive brachypterous and diapausing brachypterous) of the flightless bug Pyrrhocoris apterus were determined and related to the size of male accessory glands. The results revealed wing morph- and age-dependent differences in the corpus allatum volume in males of this bug. In 4–14 day old males, the volumes of the corpus allatum and accessory glands were largest in long-day reproductive brachypters, intermediate in long-day macropters, and smallest in short-day diapausing brachypters. The smaller corpus allatum in young macropterous males than in same aged reproductive brachypterous males was due to the spontaneous fasting of the former. Later, starting on day 18 after adult emergence, i.e. when macropterous males were feeding normally, there were no significant differences in the volumes of the corpus allatum between long-day brachypterous and macropterous males. On the other hand, the corpus allatum of 18–28 day old diapausing brachypterous males was significantly smaller than that of same aged long-day macropterous and reproductive brachypterous males. The sizes of the corpus allatum and accessory glands were significantly positively correlated in macropterous and diapausing brachypterous males. This is the first report of corpus allatum volume-dependent wing morph-related differences in the rate of accessory gland maturation in males of insects with a non-functional macropterism. The role of differential activity of the corpus allatum in the different life history strategies of males of the two wing morphs in this wing-polymorphic insect is discussed.

N2  - The ageing trajectory (trend in ageing) and reproduction-longevity trade-off in both sexes of the ladybird Propylea dissecta were studied. The ageing trajectories of both sexes were investigated in terms of reproductive performance, using initial oviposition (egg laying within 24 h of mating) acting as an indicator of the effect of female age and initial viability (percentage of eggs laid within 24 h of mating that hatched) of the effect of male age. Ageing trends were sex dependent, with reproductive performance declining later in females than in males. Initial oviposition of females was largely age dependent and the initial viability of males was age dependent but less so than for females. There is a strong trade-off between number of matings and longevity. Statistical analyses reveal that this trade-off results from an early onset of mortality rather than an increase in mortality rate. A minimum lifespan was observed in this ladybird beyond which the longevity did not further decline.

N2  - Females of the parasitoid wasp Dinocampus coccinellae are known to parasitise both male and female coccinellid hosts. It is suggested that female hosts provide more resources for developing wasp larvae because they tend to be larger than male hosts, and female coccinellids have a much greater food intake than males. Thus the wasp’s lifetime reproductive success should be increased by ovipositing preferentially in female rather than male hosts when given a choice. Laboratory experiments, using Coccinella septempunctata as a host, show that such a preference does exist. Wasps preferentially oviposit in females, and this preference is not simply a result of the larger mean size of females compared to males. These results corroborate higher rates of prevalence in female compared to male hosts reported previously.

N2  - The number of larval moults, larval head capsule width and pupal weight were investigated in both direct-developing and diapausing individuals of a South-West European population of Coenonympha pamphilus. The frequency distributions of head widths of successive larval instars overlapped, partly due to variation in the number of larval moults. The larvae that entered diapause went through five instars, instead of the four reported from this species. The evidence indicates that the five instar developmental pathway represents a plastic response rather than an example of compensatory growth. This alternative growth pattern was expressed in response to short photoperiods in parallel with, or as a consequence of, larval diapause. On average, the larvae with five instars had larger heads than their normal siblings. This resulted in comparatively heavier male pupae, while the opposite trend occurred in females. It is concluded that the variation in the number of larval instars is a plastic response to diapause when temperatures remain mild and that it might have an adaptive value in areas with mild winter climates. The sexually dimorphic expression in the larval growth patterns, in terms of pupal weight, may well imply different patterns of allocation of larval resources to adult structures, although sex-dependent differences in investment into purely larval structures cannot be discounted.

N2  - The developmental time and size of a solitary koinobiont parasitoid, Gronotoma micromorpha (Perkins) (Hymenoptera: Eucoilidae), were measured in two host species: the serpentine leafminer, Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess) (Diptera: Agromyzidae) and tomato leafminer, L. bryoniae (Kaltenbach). There was no significant difference in the developmental time of G. micromorpha in these two hosts. However, significantly larger G. micromorpha adults emerged from L. bryoniae than from L. trifolii puparia. Dissection of larvae revealed that when offered a choice G. micromorpha accepted larvae of L. bryoniae more often than those of L. trifolii. The number of wasps emerging from parasitized hosts did not differ significantly between host species. These results indicate that L. trifolii and L. bryoniae are both acceptable and suitable hosts for G. micromorpha. Gronotoma micromorpha may be a useful biological control agent of both L. trifolii and L. bryoniae.

N2  - One way of reducing the rapid decline in biological diversity in agricultural landscapes is to establish wildflower areas. The species richness and abundance of heteropteran bugs in twenty 1- to 4-year-old wildflower areas and winter wheat fields were compared, and the effects of succession in the wildflower areas investigated. Vegetation and environmental parameters (plant species richness, vegetation structure, flower abundance, field size, surrounding landscape) and their effects on bug species were explored. Total species richness and abundance of bugs were significantly lower in wheat fields than in wildflower areas but did not differ in the wildflower areas of different ages. The numbers of zoophagous bugs in the wildflower areas were positively correlated with the age of the wildflower areas. Correspondence analysis showed that the bug species composition in the winter wheat fields was very similar but strongly separated from that in the wildflower areas. The species composition of bugs in the wildflower areas became increasingly dissimilar with advancing successional age. In a partial canonical correspondence analysis, the bug assemblage was significantly associated with the number of perennial plant species, the number of annual plant species and vegetation structure, which accounted for 13.4%, 12.6% and 7.2% of the variance, respectively. As wildflower areas clearly increased heteropteran diversity on arable land and bug species composition changed with increasing successional stage, the establishment of a mosaic of wildflower areas of different age is recommended as it enables the survival of heteropteran bugs with different life history traits.

N2  - Dead wood of arborescent Euphorbia plants in the Macaronesian islands and Morocco has a diverse fauna of wood-boring beetles. Thirty-eight species were found in four species groups of Euphorbia, including 29 species of scolytine bark beetles, six species of cossonine weevils, two species of Laemophloeidae and one of Monotomidae. All scolytines (but not cossonines and cucujoids) have narrow host preferences, using only one host group for feeding and reproduction. The number of islands on which each species was found was also limited, resulting in geographically distinct guilds for each Euphorbia host. The majority of species (26) were found on the E. lamarckii species complex, followed by E. balsamifera (13) and the succulents E. canariense (12) and E. echinus (3), while only two species were found on the rare montane species, E. longifolia, in Madeira. Up to six or seven species could be found in a single branch of E. lamarckii and E. canariense, respectively, but more than half of the plants had fewer than three species. Putative niche partitioning was indicated by the alternative utilization of different tissues in E. balsamifera and different moisture preferences in the succulent E. canariense. Several unusual features of bark beetle reproductive biology were also observed, including infrequent communal nesting and very small broods. Taken together with the phylogenetic, geographical and biological data now available for most species associated with dead Euphorbia, several of the beetle guilds should provide promising model systems for studying of species interactions and community structure.

N2  - During a three year study in rapeseed-mustard crop, the response of two ladybird species, Coccinella septempunctata and Menochilus sexmaculatus was dependent upon density and time of appearance of their prey. Mustard aphid, Lipaphis erysimi appeared during the second (2000 and 2001) and last (2002) week of January. Aphid appearance was highly dependent on the phenological stage of the host plant. It appeared earlier in rapeseed, Brassica campestris var. BSH-1 than mustard, Brassica juncea var. RH-30. The ladybird beetle’s eggs were observed in the last week of January, 4–5 weeks before the maximum aphid population. A correlation between aphid number and the abundance of ladybirds’ life stages (egg, larva and beetle) on these host plants revealed that the egg and larval density was positively correlated to aphid numbers. Adult beetles, however, did not show significant positive correlation with aphid numbers during all the three years of study. Coccinella septempunctata was more abundant than Menochilus sexmaculatus in these crops. Menochilus sexmaculatus population disappeared earlier than Coccinella septempunctata which was abundant until end of the crop season.

N2  - Adult head structures of Lepicerus inaequalis were examined in detail and interpreted functionally and phylogenetically. The monogeneric family clearly belongs to Myxophaga. A moveable process on the left mandible is an autapomorphy of the suborder. Even though Lepiceridae is the "basal" sistergroup of the remaining three myxophagan families, it is likely the group which has accumulated most autapomorphic features, e.g. tuberculate surface structure, internalised antennal insertion, and a specific entognathous condition. Adults of Lepiceridae and other myxophagan groups possess several features which are also present in larvae (e.g., premental papillae, semimembranous mandibular lobe). This is probably related to a very similar life style and has nothing to do with "desembryonisation". Lepiceridae and other myxophagans share a complex and, likely, derived character of the feeding apparatus with many polyphagan groups (e.g., Staphyliniformia). The mandibles are equipped with large molae and setal brushes. The latter interact with hairy processes or lobes of the epi- and hypopharynx. This supports a sistergroup relationship between both suborders.

N2  - Structures that assist in spreading secretions produced by the metathoracic glands were examined in Reduviidae and Pachynomidae (Heteroptera). The systematic distribution of a row of long and stout setae on the metacoxa, the metacoxal comb, was reinvestigated in a representative sample in both taxa. Observations on living Dipetalogaster maximus (Reduviidae: Triatominae) corroborated the interpretation of this metacoxal comb as an evaporatory device, which assists in atomizing the gland secretions. In addition to the metacoxal comb, a row of stout setae on the metacetabulum – a metacetabular comb – was found in several Reduviidae, which interacts with the metacoxal comb during rotation of the metacoxa. In addition to those atomizing devices, cuticular modifications surrounding the opening of the metathoracic gland, which presumably form evaporatoria, were discovered in Ectrichodiinae. The meshwork-like structure of this cuticle resembles the cuticular modifications found associated with the opening of the Brindley’s gland in Reduviidae, but differs from the mushroom-like evaporatoria around the metathoracic glands in most Cimicomorpha and Pentatomomorpha. Thus, two fundamentally different mechanisms to spread secretions of the metathoracic gland – atomization and evaporation – are present in Reduviidae.

N2  - Elektrophthiria magnifica gen. n., sp. n., oldest bee fly of the bombyliid subfamily Phthiriinae, is described from the Lowermost Eocene amber of Oise (France). It suggests at least a Late Cretaceous age for this group, coincident with the diversification of the flowering plants. Eurodoliopteryx inexpectatus gen. n., sp. n., oldest representative of the mythicomyiid subfamily Glabellulinae, is probably the sister genus of extant Doliopteryx, distributed in Africa and the Arabian peninsula, under very arid conditions. This discovery suggests a relatively humid forest close to a river with a drier surrounding area for the palaeoenvironment of the Oise amber.

N2  - The Metriorrhynchus fauna of the Philippines is revised. All known species are redescribed and seven new species are added: M. isarogensis sp. n., M. menieri sp. n., M. mindanaoensis sp. n., M. newbataanensis sp. n., M. ochii sp. n., M. palawanensis sp. n., and M. takedai sp. n. Additionally, M. yoshioi sp. n. is described from Sulawesi. Xylobanus longissimus Pic, 1922 is transferred to Metriorrhynchus, and Metriorrhynchus pallidus (Dalman in Schoenherr, 1818) is transferred to Leptotrichalus Kleine, 1925. The dispersal routes and speciation of Metriorrhynchus from the Philippines, Sulawesi and the Oriental Region were studied using mtDNA markers. One dispersal event is supposed for establishing of the Greater Sunda Islands fauna and another one for the Philippine fauna. Both faunas underwent speciation in the respective areas and all species show high degree of endemism. The Metriorrhynchus in Palawan is of Philippine origin in contrast with the tectonic history of Palawan and its connection with Borneo during the last glacial maximum.

N2  -  The blister beetle genus Teratolytta, belonging to the tribe Lyttini, is revised and a classification is proposed. Two main sections of the genus – one including five groups of species and the other three groups – are tentatively defined. Four new species from Eastern and Southern Anatolia are described (T. carlae sp. n., T. dvoraki sp. n., T. monticola sp. n., T. taurica sp. n.), and a key to the 17 recognized species is proposed. A diagnosis of the species as well as taxonomic remarks are proposed, and a catalogue of localities is presented. In particular, Teratolytta tricolor (Haag-Rutenberg, 1880) comb. n. is re-established as a distinct species, T. cooensis G. Müller, 1936 is confirmed as a synonym of T. gentilis (Frivaldszky, 1877), T. bytinskii Kaszab, 1957 as a synonym of T. senilis (Abeille de Perrin, 1895), and T. holzschuhi Dvoøák, 1983 is proposed as a synonym of T. eylandti Semenow, 1894; some infraspecific forms are referred to the variability of T. gentilis and T. flavipes (Mulsant & Rey, 1858).

Evolutionary trends in the development of the hypandrium in the subfamily Psilinae are discussed.

N2  - The New World species of Loxocera Meigen are revised including two new species, L. (Imantimyia) ignyodactyla Buck sp. n. from Costa Rica (first record of the genus from the Neotropical region) and L. (Imantimyia) ojibwayensis Buck sp. n. from Ontario, Canada. Loxocera californica Capelle is synonymized with L. collaris Loew and lectotypes are designated for L. pleuritica Loew and L. cylindrica var. obsoleta Johnson (both synonyms of L. cylindrica Say). The New World species are diagnosed and a key to species is provided. The male and female terminalia of Loxocera are described in detail for the first time, and their functional morphology is discussed. Eggs of most species are described and a key to the known eggs of Loxocera is provided. A phylogenetic framework for the Holarctic subgenera and species groups of Loxocera is developed based on morphological characters of the adult flies. The Old World subgenus Platystyla Macquart is synonymized with Loxocera s. str., and Imantimyia Frey is reinstated as a valid subgenus including all Holarctic species previously placed in Loxocera s. str. except the L. aristata species group. This leads to the following new subgeneric combinations: L. (L.) malaisei Frey comb. n., L. (L.) matsumurai Iwasa comb. n., L. (L.) monstrata Iwasa, comb. n., and L. (L.) omei Shatalkin comb. n. The species groups of Imantimyia are redefined, i.e. the L. achaeta-group (7 spp.), the L. fulviventris-group (4 spp.), and the L. albiseta-group (1 sp.). The Oriental subgenus Asiopsila Shatalkin is referred to Psila Meigen s. l. as a subgenus based on characters of the egg, resulting in fourteen new generic combinations: Psila (Asiopsila) brevibuccata (Shatalkin) comb. n., P.

N2  - The genus Berchmansus Navás, which was previously assigned to the tribe Leucochrysini, consists of three very rare species, all described from the Neotropics and all poorly known. Our report (1) provides the first description of a Berchmansus larva, the first instar of Berchmansus elegans (Guérin Méneville), (2) illustrates and redescribes the B. elegans adult, with emphasis on male and female genitalia, and (3) examines the larval and adult characters vis-à-vis the tribal affiliation of the genus. Given that the B. elegans adult and first instar share many apomorphies with other belonopterygine genera, this species belongs in the cosmopolitan tribe Belonopterygini, rather than the New World tribe Leucochrysini. Although Berchmansus larvae have not been collected in the field, we suspect that, like other belonopterygines, they are associated with ant nests. B. elegans exhibits a number of highly modified and unusual structures, some of which (#1 to #5) are not reported for any other chrysopids. Specifically: Males have (1) a unique, quadrate, dome-like hood above the gonarcus and (2) large, coiled parameres on the gonosaccus. First instars have (3) a greatly enlarged subapical seta on the flagellum, (4) a transverse row of long, hooked setae along the dorso-anterior margin of the pronotum, and (5) setose laterodorsal tubercles on the meso- and metathorax, with (6) multi-pronged, hooked setae.

N2  - The anomaly that Anopheles culicifacies (Diptera: Culicidae) species B is a major vector of malaria in Sri Lanka, but a non-vector in India, has been noted for several years. In 1999, a Y chromosome dimorphism associated with Plasmodium vivax infectivity within the Indian A. culicifacies species B suggested that this was itself a complex of two sibling species, B and E. A recent cytogenetic analysis shows the sympatric presence of these sibling species in Sri Lanka, a situation similar to that reported from nearby Rameshwaram Island, India. Species E, with a submetacentric Y chromosome, is a more effective vector of P. vivax than species B with an acrocentric Y chromosome. Larval karyotyping, however, is time-consuming and labour-intensive. Recently, the development of a PCR-RFLP assay distinguishing species B and E of A. culicifacies from India, based on differences in one region of the cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) gene, was reported. Here we show that whilst this diagnostic approach reveals polymorphism in Sri Lankan A. culicifacies, this variation is not correlated with Y chromosome karyotype. Hence this assay will not be useful for distinguishing species B and E in Sri Lanka. Further, we found no difference between the sequences of Sri Lankan specimens in any of three other regions (ITS2, D3 region of 28S rDNA, and guanylate cyclase intron) often used for species discrimination.

N2  - Different cytogenetic techniques including C-banding, base-specific fluorochromes and silver nitrate staining were used to compare the karyotypes of three species of bugs, representatives of the Neotropical genus Antiteuchus, namely A. mixtus, A. sepulcralis and A. macraspis. The species have holokinetic chromosomes which is typical of the Hemiptera, and their diploid chromosome number is 2n = 14 and they have an XX/XY (female/male) sex chromosome system. C-banding revealed telomeric blocks of constitutive heterochromatin in most chromosomes of these three species. In each species, CMA3-positive blocks were observed in the telomeric heterochromatin region of chromosome pair 1. This chromosome pair carried the nucleolar organizer region (NOR), which silver nitrate staining revealed is located in the telomeric heterochromatin. In contrast to the result obtained with CMA3, entire chromosome complement stained homogenously with DAPI, except for the telomeric region of pair 1, which remained unstained.

N2  - Nicrophorine beetles use small vertebrate carrion for breeding resource. While Nicrophorus spp. have highly developed biparental care, no form of parental care is recorded for Ptomascopus spp. We examined two effects of resource guarding by Ptomascopus morio. The presence of parents, especially the female, reduced the number of fly larvae on chicken carrion. Parents also enhanced the survival of brood faced with predation by the rove beetle, Ontholestes gracilis. In 6 out of 20 trials, the rove beetle predators were killed by Ptomascopus morio parents. We conclude that Ptomascopus morio has a simple, and possibly primitive form of parental care.

N2  - Temporary malnutrition during juvenile development often negatively influences the life-history decisions of adults. Hence, individuals should avoid this effect by compensatory feeding on the limited resource when the food situation improves. In a feeding experiment, bush-crickets (Pholidoptera griseoaptera) responded to nine days depression of animal food supply by increasing their feeding activities on insect carcasses when a full-nutritional diet was available. As a short-term reaction, treated individuals of both sexes took 3.4times more food from carcasses (0.084g/9h) than control individuals. The increased carcass intake levelled off at 0.025g/9h after an interval of nine hours, indicating that bush-crickets can rapidly compensate for an experimentally increased demand for animal diet. The general daily carcass intake of male and female bush-crickets was 0.07g fresh weight, corresponding to 16.4% of the bush-cricket’s body mass. Carcass intake and body mass development was correlated over the complete period (7d), but no correlation was found for the time of short-term reaction. We conclude that animal diet is essential for the growth of dark bush-crickets. They were able to compensate for short depressions in animal food supply by increasing feeding frequencies and feeding rates of the limited resource. Hence, bush-crickets can cope with short periods of limited animal food supply, e.g. periods of rainfall, which regularly occur in their natural habitat.

N2  - Three secondary compounds, pyrocatechol, gramine and ferulic acid from wheat were separately incorporated into artificial diets and fed to cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) larvae to determine their effects on larval and pupal weights and the nutritional indices of the larvae. The results show that these three secondary compounds can decrease the mean larval and pupal weights of cotton bollworm, with the mean larvae weights differing significantly between treatments. Mean pupal weight was only significantly reduced by ferulic acid and gramine, but not pyrocatechol. There were significant correlations between mean larval weight and concentration of the three secondary compounds tested, and between mean pupal weight and concentration of ferulic acid and gramine. The three secondary compounds tested affected the nutritional indices of cotton bollworm larvae differently. Compared with the control, ferulic acid and gramine significantly decreased RGR (the relative growth rate), AD (approximate digestibility) and ECD (conversion efficiency) of cotton bollworm larvae, and pyrocatechol only reduced ECD. All three indices were the lowest for cotton bollworm larvae fed on the diet with gramine (0.0984 ± 0.0114 g/g/day, 14.2670 ± 1.1541% and 31.1337 ± 1.1213%).

N2  - Intercropping may have a positive effect on the abundance and activity of carabid beetles and therefore their response to intercropping yellow lupin with spring triticale was studied for a period of three years (2001–2003). Carabids were most numerous in yellow lupin monoculture and in the intercrop with the highest proportion of lupin. Important differences between the experimental treatments were found, but they were mostly non-significant because of the great variation between samples. It is supposed that the positive effect of lupin on carabid beetles was due to the shelter it provides. During the three-year study 59 species of carabid beetles were recorded. The most abundant species in each treatment was Pseudoophonus rufipes. Irrespective of the experimental treatment, this species was caught in the greatest numbers towards the end of each growing season. This was probably because of the greater soil coverage provided by the larger lupin plants at the end of the season.

There was progressive increase in the time devoted to xylem ingestion (G waveform) and concomitant decrease in time devoted to phloem ingestion (E2 waveform) in parasitized relative to unparasitized aphids, as the time from parasitisation increased. These changes are interpreted as a way aphids compensate for metabolic changes occurring during parasitisation.

N2  - At five sites in Hungary and Italy, traps baited with phenylacetaldehyde caught significantly higher numbers (10 to 100 times more) of green lacewings than unbaited traps, which demonstrates that this compound is an attractant. Traps with three bait dispensers usually caught more than those with one dispenser, but the difference was significant only at two out of five test sites. There was no difference in the numbers caught by sticky delta and funnel traps baited with phenylacetaldehyde. However, funnel traps could be adapted to catch living green lacewings. The vast majority of the specimens belonged to the Chrysoperla carnea species complex. Ch. carnea sensu lato dominated the catches at all sites. At some sites 3–11% of the insects caught were Ch. lucasina Lacroix. Phenylacetaldehyde-baited traps were attractive to both sexes, but generally more females were caught than males. Funnel traps baited with three dispensers of phenylacetaldehyde caught green lacewing adults throughout the season in Hungary.

N2  - The karyotypes of pseudoscorpions of three families, Geogarypidae, Garypinidae and Olpiidae (Arachnida: Pseudoscorpiones), were studied for the first time. Three species of the genus Geogarypus from the family Geogarypidae and 10 species belonging to 8 genera from the family Olpiidae were studied. In the genus Geogarypus the diploid chromosome numbers of males range from 15 to 23. In the family Olpiidae the male chromosome numbers vary greatly, from 7 to 23. The male karyotype of single studied member of the family Garypinidae, Garypinus dimidiatus, is composed of 33 chromosomes. It is proposed that the karyotype evolution of the families Geogarypidae and Olpiidae was characterised by a substantial decrease of chromosome numbers. The diploid numbers of some olpiids are the lowest known 2n within pseudoscorpions and even one of the lowest within the class Arachnida. In spite of a considerable reduction of diploid numbers, all species studied possess a X0 sex chromosome system that is widespread and probably ancestral in pseudoscorpions. Moreover, X chromosomes retain conservative metacentric morphology in the majority of species. During the first meiotic division of males, a high number of chiasmata were observed in some species, up to five per bivalent in Indolpium sp. The transient stage between pachytene and diplotene is typically characterised by extensive decondensation of chromatin in males of geogarypids and in Calocheiridius libanoticus, and we interpret this as a diffuse stage. This is recorded in pseudoscorpions for the first time. The relationships between some species belonging to the family Olpiidae are discussed based on the data obtained.

N2  - A thioredoxin-like protein (txl) gene was cloned from the bumblebee, Bombus ignitus. The B. ignitus txl (Bitxl) gene spans 1777 bp and consists of three introns and four exons coding for 285 amino acid residues with a conserved active site (CGPC). The deduced amino acid sequence of the Bitxl cDNA was 65% similar to the Drosophila melanogaster txl. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of Bitxl transcripts in all tissues examined. When H2O2 was injected into the body cavity of B. ignitus workers, Bitxl mRNA expression was up-regulated in the fat body tissue. In addition, the expression levels of Bitxl mRNA in the fat body greatly increased when B. ignitus workers were exposed to low (4°C) or high (37°C) temperatures, or injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which suggests that the Bitxl possibly protects against oxidative stress caused by extreme temperatures and bacterial infection.

N2  - The corpora cardiaca (CC) of the two grasshopper species Zonocerus elegans (Pyrgomorphidae) and Lamarckiana sparrmani (Pamphagidae) contain (a) substance(s) that cause(s) hyperlipaemia in the migratory locust and hypertrehalosaemia in the American cockroach. Isolation of neuropeptides belonging to the adipokinetic hormone (AKH) family was achieved by single-step reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography of CC extracts from both species and monitoring tryptophan fluorescence. The material of both species showed three distinct fluorescence peaks with adipokinetic activity in the migratory locust. The peptides were identifid by at least two of the following methods: (1) sequencing by Edman degradation, (2) sequencing by tandem fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, (3) mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry and (4) co-elution of the native and synthetic peptides. Both species were found to have three AKH peptides stored in the CC, but unlike in other grasshoppers, none of those peptides were decapeptides. In Z. elegans the following three octapeptides occur: Schgr-AKH-II (pELNFSTGWamide), Peram-CAH-II (pELTFTPNWamide) and Phymo-AKH-III (pEINFTPWWamide), whereas L. sparrmani contains the octapeptides Grybi-AKH (pEVNFSTGWamide), Pyrap-AKH (pELNFTPNWamide) and also Phymo-AKH-III. Conspecific bioassays show no adipokinetic and only a weak (not significant) hypertrehalosaemic effect (in the pamphagid grasshopper). Some explanations are offered on the possible role of these peptides in the species investigated by interpreting their life style.

N2  - Haemolymph levels of amino acids, sugars and glycerol were investigated in the tenebrionid Physadesmia globosa during dehydration and rehydration. The absolute amount of amino acid decreases during dehydration and increases during rehydration, indicating active regulation of this solute (the osmolal contribution of amino acids is large – approx. 25%). Changes in the amino acid content of the haemolymph during dehydration are not the result of interchange with soluble protein; the possibility exists during rehydration (between 1 h and 48 h). Trehalose and glucose are the only sugars found in appreciable quantity in the haemolymph of this species. Their osmolal contributions (total sugar: 2.6%), and contributions to osmoregulation, are not great. Glycerol is a minor osmolar effector in the haemolymph of Physadesmia, and changes in its levels do not contribute importantly to the regulation of haemolymph osmotic pressure.

N2  - This paper reports the results of a comparative laboratory analysis of the behavioural responses of the egg parasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Wollaston) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) to semiochemical cues from four species of pentatomid bugs, Nezara viridula (L.), Eurydema ventrale Klt., Murgantia histrionica Hahn. and Graphosoma semipunctatum F. (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae). In a Y-tube olfactometer, T. basalis was attracted by volatile chemicals from N. viridula, but not from other pentatomid species. In an open arena, the parasitoid reacted to chemical trails left on filter paper by all the species but most intensely to those left by N. viridula. However, upon encountering pentatomid eggs, T. basalis examined more intensely and probed more frequently the eggs of G. semipunctatum than those of the other species. The parasitoid only parasitized and emerged from eggs of G. semipunctatum and N. viridula; those of the other species were unsuitable. Therefore N. viridula is semiochemically confirmed to be a coevolved host (old association) of T. basalis, whereas G. semipunctatum may be a potential non-coevolved host (new association). The utility of these tests for defining a parasitoids’ host specificity and in assessing the risk of non-target effects in biological control is discussed.

N2  - Using an opto-cardiograph combined with an infrared gas analyzer regular bouts of abdominal contractions were recorded from last instar larva of Bombus terrestris. The rate of CO2 release was about 0.7 ml g–1 h–1. The bouts of contractions were of two types: weak extracardiac pulsations and vigorous pumping. The frequencies of pulsations and pumping were 25–35 per min and 8–12 per min, respectively. Bouts of extracardiac pulsations and abdominal pumping were independent of each other and sometimes overlapped. Cardiac contractions (heartbeats) were continuous (57–63 pulses/min). This study suggests that the periodically occurring abdominal contractions play an essential role in respiration and/or in haemolymph circulation in larvae of B. terrestris.

N2  - The incidence of sibling cannibalism in clutches of Harmonia axyridis infected by the male-killing Spiroplasma was compared with that in uninfected clutches, and the way in which fitness compensation was realized by sibling cannibalism was investigated. Primarily the rate of sibling cannibalism was determined by the hatching rate as all unviable eggs were consumed both in infected and uninfected clutches. Per capita consumption of roughly 0.1 individuals was estimated for uninfected clutches in the present study, as compared to 0.3 individuals in previous studies. The per capita consumption in infected clutches was 1.4, showing that the male-killing behavior of the Spiroplasma provides an approximately 4–14 fold increase in the chance of sibling cannibalism. Both in infected and uninfected clutches, the median of the starting time of sibling cannibalism was soon after that of the completion of hatching. Larvae started to disperse from their egg clutches only about 7.5–8.5 h after the initiation of hatching. These time sequences indicate that sibling cannibalism occurs at the earlier stage of the hatching process and the density of aphids in the area has little or no influence on incidence of the sibling cannibalism. During the maintenance of the infected line for five generations, exclusively females were produced and the median of the hatching rate was 0.395, suggesting a very high rate of vertical transmission of the Spiroplasma infection. Although the measurement of other parameters, such as the effect of Spiroplasma infection on fecundity or longevity, are necessary, the high compensation rate shown in the present study, together with the very high vertical transmission, may explain the prevalence of the present male-killing agent in the local populations of the ladybird beetle.

N2  - Our study focuses on a series of biological characteristics that Anomalochrysa hepatica exhibits; herein, we compare these features with those expressed by two other species within the endemic Hawaiian lacewing genus. Some of the characteristics (No. 2–3, below) vary greatly among the three congeners and may be of phylogenetic importance; others (No. 1, below) probably are not. Our study showed the following: (1) Developmental response to temperature. Anomalochrysa hepatica’s developmental rates under a range of temperatures parallel those of the congener A. maclachlani, but A. hepatica’s thermal threshold is lower. It is possible that both species’ developmental responses to temperature are subject to considerable geographic variation and thus are of little phylogenetic significance at the species level. (2) Larval color change. Third instars of A. hepatica undergo a striking color change as they mature. In expressing this trait, A. hepatica resembles its closely related congener, A. maclachlani, but differs from the more distantly related congener, A. frater. This color change may have phylogenetic importance. (3) Reproductive behavior. Courtship and mating in Anomalochrysa comprise a consistent sequence of behavioral elements, some of which differ among the three species. For example, during courtship, A. hepatica produces readily audible clicks that are associated with forward flicking of the forewings; in A. maclachlani, readily audible clicking occurs with simultaneous flicking of the fore- and hind wings; in A. frater wing-flicking is present but we did not perceive audible clicks. Some of the interspecific variation in mating behavior may also involve specific morphological modifications; aspects of both the behavioral and morphological variation may provide useful characters for phylogenetic study. (4) Oviposition and rates of egg survival in the field. Unlike other Chrysopidae, endemic Hawaiian Anomalochrysa, including A. hepatica, typically lay unstalked eggs; however, species vary in their patterns of egg laying. Both A. hepatica and A. maclachlani deposit clustered eggs, whereas A. frater lays eggs singly. In nature, the average rate of hatching per A. hepatica egg mass was ~75%. Several species of introduced predators and a species of trichogrammatid parasitoid attacked these eggs.

N2  - Male production was examined in 70 Myzus persicae s.str and M. persicae nicotianae clonal lineages at 17°C and 10L : 14D. Sixty nine were characterised by a partial loss of sexuality (androcyclic producing few males, and intermediates producing some males and mating females), and one was found to be permanently parthenogenetic. High within and between lineage variation was detected. Most (81%) of the clonal lineages produced few males (0–5 males per parent) and only 6% had male production (10–16 males per parent) comparable to that (12–23 males per parent) of seven lineages with a sexual phase (holocyclic) which were examined under the same conditions. The length of prenatal exposure to 10L : 14D increased the production of males. Continuous rearing under 10L : 14D at 12°C adversely affected male production in another intermediate clonal lineage. Temperature was found to affect the production of sexuals and to modify the short day photoperiodic response. The production of males and mating females was higher at 12°C than at 17°C in most of the 20 aforementioned clonal lineages with a partial loss of sexuality. Six lineages were permanently parthenogenetic at 17°C, but two of them produced a few males and the other four a few males and mating females at 12°C. Seven lineages which produced a few males at 17°C, also produced some mating females at 12°C. Lastly, photoperiod similarly affected the production of sexuals in two of the aforementioned clonal lineages, one with a sexual phase and one intermediate, although the regimes for the peak of sexuals were different. In both lineages, however, males appeared in a 0.5–1 h shorter scotophase than mating females.

N2  - Seasonal cycles constitute a major challenge for organisms since they may influence the genetic composition of a population, the species structure of a community and the interactions between organisms. Diapause is frequently used by insects to synchronize their life cycle with seasonal changes and is regarded as a key factor in the coexistence of competing species. Here the occurrence, abundance and emergence patterns of three poorly-known species of carnid flies (Carnus hemapterus Nitzsch, 1818, Hemeromyia anthracina Collin, 1949 and Hemeromyia longirostris Carles-Tolrá, 1992), which overwintered in the nests of several bird species at two localities, are reported and evidence of possible interspecific competition sought. Larvae of all three species were found in association with carrion and detritus. Both Hemeromyia species co-occurred in around 50% of the nests and Carnus with each of the Hemeromyia species at a lower rate (30–40% of the nests). Coexistence of all three carnid species was rare. We did not find any evidence of interspecific competition in the larval stage. Coexistence did not reduce the number of flies that emerged of any of the three species and the abundance of some species was even positively related. Species-specific emergence patterns and different habitat selection criteria (Carnus hemapterus seemed to avoid nests lined with vegetable material), which diminished the overlap between species were found. Such spatial and temporal segregation could facilitate the coexistence of these closely related species, which have similar ecological requirements, and might influence the seasonal dynamics of this poorly-known assemblage of insects inhabiting the nests of birds.

N2  - At maturity, the endoparasitoid larvae of several subfamilies of the Braconidae have to emerge from inside of the host to pupate. Although the hosts hormonal milieu and the timing of larval parasitoid emergence have been studied, no report has yet focused on the physiological state of the host in connection with the emergence behavior of endoparasitoids. We investigated the mechanism of larval emergence behavior in a gregarious endoparasitoid, Cotesia kariyai. The parasitoid larvae inserted their mandibles into the host cuticle and perforated the integument by moving their head-capsule backwards and forwards. The emerging parasitoid larva must have a physical support (an "anchor”) with the terminal appendages in order to exert the necessary pressure to cut the host integument. Morphological observations revealed that each parasitoid larva was enveloped in a capsule just before emerging from their host. Eight and nine day-old parasitoid larvae secreted material around their bodies to form these capsules. This material consisted of acid-glycoproteins which coated the exuvium of the 2nd instar larvae. The haemolymph volume of the parasitised host also decreased in later stages and was dramatically reduced immediatly prior to parasitoid emergence. This final reduction of the host haemolymph volume is the result of absorption by parasitoid larvae. This mechanism allows the parasitoid larvae to create an anchor more easily. The parasitoid larvae could also adhere to each other with the glycoprotein. In addition, these capsules prevent the leaking of host haemolymph through the emergence hole; these holes on the host integument were plugged by the capsules after parasitoid emergence. Although the pressure acquired by the anchor was lost once the head of the parasitoid larvae emerges from the host integument, the parasitoid larvae crawls out of the host cavity using backward pointing spines which enable the parasitoid to grip the capsule and move forward via peristaltic contractions.

N2  - Ground beetles (Carabidae: Coleoptera) are predators of the seed of herbaceous plants scattered on the ground, but prefer that of certain species. Foraging beetles encounter both freshly dispersed and seed exhumed from the soil bank. The predation on seed from the soil bank has never been studied and the effect of burial on seed acceptability is unknown. The preferences of two generalist granivorous carabids, Harpalus affinis and Pseudoophonus rufipes, were investigated by offering them fresh (stored frozen after dispersal) and buried (for 6 months in the soil under field conditions) seed of six common weed species. Significantly more of the buried seed of Tripleurospermum inodorum and significantly less of that of Taraxacum officinale was eaten than fresh seed. For four other weed species the consumption of both kinds of seed did not differ. The preferences were similar in both species of carabid. The change in preference probably occurred because the seed of T. officinale was partially decayed and the repellent surface of T. inodorum seed abraded. Provided the seed in the soil bank does not decay it may have a similar or better food value for carabids than fresh seed.

N2  - The horse chestnut leaf miner, Cameraria ohridella Deschka & Dimiæ, is a species of unknown origin that recently invaded most of Europe, causing serious damage to horse chestnut trees, Aesculus hippocastanum. Parasitism was studied over a period of three years in the region of Plzeò in the Czech Republic. Additional collections were made in Slovakia and Slovenia. The parasitoid complex, dominated by polyphagous idiobiont parasitoids of the family Eulophidae, is similar to that found in other studies in Europe. Minotetrastichus frontalis (Nees) was the most abundant parasitoid found, except in Slovakia where Pediobius saulius (Walker) dominated. One parasitoid species, the eulophid Cirrospilus diallus (Walker) was recorded for the first time from C. ohridella. A new method is proposed to calculate stage-specific and total parasitism rates. Parasitism rates of spinning larvae and pupae were higher than of feeding larvae; however, total parasitism was low. We estimated that between 1% and 17% of moths died from parasitism during the larval and pupal stages whereas the rate of mortality caused by other factors varied from 7% to 62%, depending on the locality, year and generation. The proposed method for calculating total parasitism, based on the integration of stage-specific parasitism rates, which takes into account the mortality not directly attributed to parasitism, is discussed and compared with other methods commonly used in studies on C. ohridella.

The results of these experiments indicated that, with one species present, S. oryzae and T. confusum adults were equally attracted to traps baited with the aggregation pheromone of that species and to traps baited with both pheromones. In contrast, when both species were present, neither S. oryzae nor T. confusum showed specific behavioural trend towards a stimulus. Traps baited with 1 g of a mixture of plant extracts were significantly more attractive for both species than unbaited traps, but this response was highly influenced by the number of individuals of each species released. Traps baited with filter papers that were previously contaminated by live adults of both species were particularly attractive for S. oryzae, but not for T. confusum. Traps that contained 10 seeds damaged by S. oryzae were significantly more attractive than traps containing an oil lure or control traps for S. oryzae, but not for T. confusum. The addition of oil to the seeds did not affect the attractiveness of the trap for S. oryzae. Traps that contained 20 live S. oryzae adults were significantly more attractive than traps containing 20 dead S. oryzae adults or control traps. No significant differences were noted between traps containing 20 dead S. oryzae adults and control traps. The presence of S. oryzae adults in traps did not affect the response of T. confusum.

N2  - Responsiveness of Lepidoptera phenology to climate has been detected in a number of species during the current trend in global warming. There is still a question of whether climate signals would be evident in historical data. In this paper we examine the climatic response of 155 species of moths and butterflies collected during the period 1866–1884 in Wiltshire, southern England. In general, species responded to increased temperature in the previous October by delayed appearance and to increased temperature in the current spring by advanced appearance. Thus, differential changes in temperatures of the autumn and spring could well affect changes in the relative pattern of the phenology of species. Attributes influencing the species’ ecology were examined to see if they influenced temperature responsiveness. In general, few consistent effects emerged, though responsiveness to climate was found to be greater for species eclosing later in the year, specifically to the previous autumn temperatures, and to hibernal environment, increasingly for species less exposed to air temperatures. These findings warn against expecting simple responses to climate warming.

N2  - Giant hogweed, Heracleum mantegazzianum (Apiaceae), was introduced from the Caucasus into Western Europe more than 150 years ago and later became an invasive weed which created major problems for European authorities. Phytophagous insects were collected in the native range of the giant hogweed (Caucasus) and were compared to those found on plants in the invaded parts of Europe. The list of herbivores was compiled from surveys of 27 localities in nine countries during two seasons. In addition, literature records for herbivores were analysed for a total of 16 Heracleum species. We recorded a total of 265 herbivorous insects on Heracleum species and we analysed them to describe the herbivore assemblages, locate vacant niches, and identify the most host-specific herbivores on H. mantegazzianum. When combining our investigations with similar studies of herbivores on other invasive weeds, all studies show a higher proportion of specialist herbivores in the native habitats compared to the invaded areas, supporting the "enemy release hypothesis" (ERH). When analysing the relative size of the niches (measured as plant organ biomass), we found less herbivore species per biomass on the stem and roots, and more on the leaves (Fig. 5). Most herbivores were polyphagous generalists, some were found to be oligophagous (feeding within the same family of host plants) and a few had only Heracleum species as host plants (monophagous). None were known to feed exclusively on H. mantegazzianum. The oligophagous herbivores were restricted to a few taxonomic groups, especially within the Hemiptera, and were particularly abundant on this weed.

N2  - Sampling of insect communities is very challenging and for reliable interpretation of results the effects of different sampling protocols and data processing on the results need to be fully understood. We compared three different commonly used methods for sampling forest beetles, freely hanging flight-intercept (window) traps (FWT), flight-intercept traps attached to trunks (TWT) and pitfall traps placed in the ground (PFT), in Scots pine dominated boreal forests in eastern Finland. Using altogether 960 traps, forming 576 sub-samples, at 24 study sites, 59760 beetles belonging to 814 species were collected over a period of a month. All of the material was identified to species, with the exception of a few species pairs, to obtain representative data for analyses. Four partly overlapping groups were used in the analyses: (1) all, (2) saproxylic, (3) rare and (4) red-listed species. In terms of the number of species collected TWTs were the most effective for all species groups and the rarer species the species group composed of (groups 1-2-3-4) the larger were the differences between the trap types. In particular, the TWTs caught most red-listed species. However, when sample sizes were standardized FWTs and TWTs caught similar number of species of all species groups. PFTs caught fewer species of all species groups, whether the sample sizes were standardized or not. In boreal forests they seem to be unsuitable for sampling saproxylic, rare and red-listed species. However, the PFTs clearly sampled different parts of species assemblages than the window traps and can be considered as a supplementary method. The abundance distribution of saproxylic species was truncated lognormal in TWT and pooled material, whereas unclassified material failed to reveal lognormal distribution in all the trap types and pooled material. The results show that even in boreal forests sample sizes of at least thousands, preferably tens of thousands of individuals, collected by a high number of traps are needed for community level studies. Relevant ecological classification of material is also very important for reliable comparisons. Differences in the performance of trap types should be considered when designing a study, and in particular when evaluating the results.

N2  - Internal and external features of the head of Ascioplaga mimeta (Coleoptera: Archostemata) were studied with micro X-ray computertomography (µCT) and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). These methods allowed the reconstruction of the entire internal anatomy from the only available fixed specimen. The mouthparts and their associated musculature are highly derived in many aspects. Their general configuration corresponds to that of Priacma serrata (the only other archostematan studied in comparable detail). However, the mandible-maxilla system of A. mimeta is built as a complex sorting apparatus and shows a distinct specialisation for a specific, but still unknown, food source. The phylogenetic analysis resulted in the identification of a new monophylum comprising the genera [Distocupes + (Adinolepis +Ascioplaga)]. The members of this taxon are restricted to the Australian zoogeographic region. The most prominent synapomorphies of these three genera are their derived mouthparts.

N2  - The male genitalia of the fritillary butterfly Issoria lathonia (L.) were examined and reconstructed based on sagittal and horizontal sections. Nine intrinsic muscles were identified consistent with previous results. The retractor of the anal tube probably operates the "rectal plate", a large, sclerotised, arched plate present ventral to the rectum and dorsal to the phallus in all Issoria s. str. species. The function of the rectal plate is still largely unknown, but it has presumably an important function during copulation. The retractor of the phallus inserts on the phallus, and also on a small, ventral sclerite in the anellus. The retractor of the vesica is smaller in I. lathonia than its counterpart in other Argynnini and originates more centrally inside the phallus. The tergal sclerite, common in most Argynnini, has no attaching muscle and its evolutionary origin remains unclear. The presence of an intrinsic muscle (i3) originating on the tegumen and inserting on the valve in Argynnini cannot be confirmed here. Though generally absent in butterflies, this muscle has been reported once in the North American Argynnis subgenus Speyeria.

N2  - Tomicus piniperda and T. destruens are sibling species which are extremely difficult to separate by morphological characters. Although several papers report differences between the two species, many characters need confirmation or better description. Moreover, new morphological characters are required for correct species determination. For these purposes, eight populations of T. destruens from Italy, Greece, Spain and Algeria, and ten of T. piniperda from Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Austria, Sweden and Italy, were investigated considering eleven morphological characters. The morphological differences most useful for the species separation include four previously described characters (colour of the elytra, colour of the antennal club, distribution of the antennal setae, distribution of the punctures along the elytral declivity), and four new characters (body proportions, setation of the first antennal club suture, sculpture of the elytral declivity and striae density of the pars stridens). Distribution of the two species is discussed and an illustrated key is included.

N2  - The intra- and interspecific variability in the West Palaearctic tibialis-group species of the subgenus Pandasyopthalmus (Diptera: Syrphidae: Paragus) was analysed. Novel immature and molecular characters were studied and the traditionally used adult characters reviewed with the aim of establishing the status of the most widespread taxa of the tibialis-group in the Palaearctic region. Moreover, a review of the morphology of the larvae of the subgenus Pandasyopthalmus is also presented and includes the first description of the chaetotaxy of the larval head of Syrphidae. The larval morphology showed a continuum between two extremes. There is intraspecific variability in the male genitalia characters typically used for diagnostic species identification in this group. Molecular characters of the mitochondrial cytochrome c-oxidase subunit I (COI) was invariant for the West Palaearctic Pandasyopthalmus taxa analysed. Despite the fact that no great differences were found when compared with Afrotropical tibialis-group individuals (uncorrected pairwise divergence 0.17–0.35%), the divergences of the West Palaearctic vs. Nearctic and Austral-Oriental tibialis-group taxa varied between 1.15–2.75% (uncorrected pairwise divergence). Molecular characters of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS2) revealed several molecular haplotypes of a dinucleotide repeat that was not constrained to morphospecies or to populations of the same geographic origin. The closely related and morphologically similar species of the tibialis-group known from the West Palaearctic region are separable in most cases only by the shape and size of male postgonites. The results of this study support the presence of a single polymorphic taxon in the West Palaearctic region (or a very recent origin of the taxa studied). Moreover larval morphology and the lack of a clear relation between ITS2 haplotypes and the geographic distribution or adult morphology, support the taxonomic implications of barcode taxonomy based on mitochondrial DNA for this species-group of Syrphidae.

N2  - Relationships of nine Italian Chrysotoxum species were analysed using morphological and molecular data. The morphology-derived cladogram revealed three well-defined groups: (i) C. cautum, (ii) the arcuatum group (C. arcuatum, C. fasciolatum) and (iii) the festivum group (C. festivum – C. vernale, C. bicinctum, C. elegans, C. octomaculatum and C. parmense). Trees inferred from COI-tRNALeu-COII sequences were largely in agreement, but they identified (i) C. parmense as an isolated branch, (ii) C. festivum and C. vernale as separate entities, (iii) C. elegans within a paraphyletic C. festivum clade. ITS2 trees were partially unresolved but C. parmense sequence emerged as a sister to the festivum group. The monophyly of the festivum group derived from morphological data was rejected by a phylogenetic test performed on combined molecular data set. The diagnostic value of some morphological characters commonly used to identify Chrysotoxum species is therefore questioned.

N2  - It is commonly held that Central Europe harbours but a single harvester ant species, namely Messor structor. Recently discovered bionomic differences between two Central European populations, which may reflect interspecific variation, cast doubt on this assumption. In the present study we test alternative hypotheses – one versus two harvester ant species in Central Europe and adjacent regions – by investigating the genetic diversity of ants determined as M. structor or close to it ("M. cf. structor”). Sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene revealed two major lineages of different but partially overlapping geographic distributions, both occurring in Central Europe. The existence of a cryptic species within M. cf. structor is the most plausible interpretation, since the sequence divergence between the two major lineages equals those between M. capitatus, M. concolor and M. bouvieri. The phylogenetic analyses revealed a distinct substructuring for both of the detected major lineages and the possible existence of additional cryptic species.

N2  - Hoplitis pici (Friese, 1899) is a rare species of bee occurring in southeast Europe, Turkey and the Near East. The females are equipped with conspicuous hooked bristles on the galeae of the proboscis. Microscopical analysis of both pollen contained in the abdominal scopa and sticking to the bodies of females indicates a distinct preference of H. pici for the flowers of Muscari Miller (Hyacinthaceae), which are characterized by having the anthers completely hidden within an urn-shaped corolla. Field observations showed that the specialized bristles serve to scrape pollen out of the Muscari flowers. Specialized bristles aiding female bees to extract pollen from narrow flower tubes must have independently evolved at least eight times in osmiine bees. H. pici is the only osmiine species known to use its pollen-harvesting bristles to exploit host plants other than narrow-tubed Boraginaceae.

N2  - The aim of this study was to obtain information on the karyotypes, testes and ovaries of three fulgoroid families, mainly in the Issidae but also in the Caliscelidae and Acanaloniidae. For the Issidae, the data is for 19 species belonging to 11 genera of the subtribes Issina (2 species, 1 genus), Hysteropterina (14 species, 9 genera) and Agalmatiina (3 species, 2 genera) of the tribe Issini. The male karyotypes are shown to be quite uniform across the tribe, with 2n = 26 + X in all species studied except Latilica maculipes (Melichar, 1906) with 2n = 24 + X. The modal karyotype, 2n = 26 + X, matches the most probable ancestral state in the Fulgoroidea. In the majority of cases the number of seminal follicles in males and ovarioles in females are stable within but fairly variable among the species, the modal value of the follicle number is 10 per testis. Contrary to what might be expected from other fulgoroid families, such as the Dictyopharidae and Delphacidae, the variability in these characters revealed neither regular trends nor evident correspondence with the taxonomy of Issidae. In the Caliscelidae, all species studied had testes consisting of 6 follicles each and karyotypes of 2n = 24 + X and 26 + XY, respectively, in 3 and 1 species. The only representative studied of the Acanaloniidae, Acanalonia bivittata (Say, 1825), had 2n = 24 + X and 13 follicles in its testis. The variability in all the characters investigated is discussed and compared to other fulgoroid families, primarily to the most extensively studied families, Delphacidae and Dictyopharidae.

N2  - Endo-polygalacturonases (PGs) are hydrolytic enzymes involved in the degradation of pectin, one of the major components of plant cell wall. While PGs from fungi, bacteria and plants have been extensively studied, PGs from insects are much less known, although they are likely to play an important role in insect-plant interactions. Presence of PGs has been reported for both piercing-sucking and chewing insect species, and possibly more commonly in mirid bugs (Heteroptera: Miridae). A screening of some common mirid species and other insects, belonging to different orders and families, was conducted using agarose diffusion assays run at different pHs. All the mirid species tested [Lygus rugulipennis Popp., L. pratensis (L.), Orthops kalmi (L.), Adelphocoris lineolatus (Goeze) and Closterotomus norwegicus (Gmelin)] showed PG activity, mainly at pH 7–8, whereas no activity was recorded for the other insect species, except Sitophilus sp. (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). PG activity in females of L. pratensis was significantly higher than in males, whereas there were no differences between the sexes in the other species. In all these species, PGs were present both in the salivary glands and the gut, with a higher activity in the salivary glands, confirming the role of these enzymes in the feeding behaviour of mirid bugs. Inhibition of mirid PGs by polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) from different plant sources was analysed at pH 7. PGIPs are extracellular plant proteins known for their ability to inhibit fungal PGs and restrict fungal colonization. Two PGIPs from Phaseolus vulgaris (PvPGIP3 and PvPGIP4) inhibited PGs of all the mirid bugs tested. This information may be helpful for the development of innovative insect-resistant plant varieties, for use in low-impact IPM.

N2  - Mechanisms of the suppression of gonadotropic activity of the corpus allatum (CA) in macropterous females were compared with those previously reported for either diapause or starving non-diapause brachypterous females by reciprocal transplantations of the neuroendocrine complexes (comprising the brain-suboesophageal ganglion-corpora cardiaca-CA). The denervated CA stimulated reproduction in most females of all experimental groups suggesting an inhibition of the CA via nervous connections with the brain. The inhibition of the CA within the transplanted neuroendocrine complex was measured by the reproductive performance of feeding recipient females deprived of their own CA. The complex from starving non-diapause brachypterous females stimulated reproduction in 58.3–78.9% of recipients suggesting that the inhibition of the CA was mostly overcome by the stimulating internal milieu of feeding females. In contrast, the "macropterous” complex stimulated reproduction in only 18.8–37.5% of recipients, similar to the "diapause brachypterous” complex (32.0%). The results indicate that the "macropterism”, similar to the diapause, is associated with a considerably lower responsiveness of the neuroendocrine complex to humoral stimulation by feeding compared to the responsivenes of the "starving” complex from brachypterous non-diapause females. On the other hand, the CA of macropterous females is of intermediate size between that of the feeding non-diapause and diapause brachypterous females, similar to the CA of the non-diapause brachypterous females deprived of food. Overall, the data suggest that the suppression of the CA activity results from a combination of the diapause-like refractoriness of the neuroendocrine complex with the starvation-like inhibition of the CA growth. Regulation of the CA activity is discussed in relation to the "oogenesis-flight syndrome” recorded for flying wing-polymorphic species of insects.

N2  - In the field, the blister beetle Mylabris phalerata Pallas (Coleoptera: Meloidae) undergoes larval diapause in the ground, which lasts for nearly six months. The effect of the soil environment on this diapause was examined. Final instar larvae kept at temperatures of ³ 26°C do not enter diapause and continued to develop regardless of the soil water content and photoperiod. Below 25°C the final instar larvae entered diapause regardless of soil water content and photoperiod. The early stages, particularly L2, appeared to be more important for diapause induction than the later stages. However, the other instars were also sensitive. Temperature, rather then photoperiod was the main factor influencing pupal duration.

N2  - Effect of photoperiod on the duration of summer and winter diapause was investigated in the cabbage butterfly, Pieris melete. By keeping naturally induced aestivating and hibernating pupae under various photoperiods, it was shown that diapause duration of aestivating pupae was significantly longer at long than at short daylengths, whereas diapause duration of hibernating pupae was significantly shorter at long than at short daylengths, suggesting both aestivating and hibernating pupae require opposite photoperiodic signals to promote diapause development. By transferring diapausing pupae, induced under various photoperiods, to 20°C with a naturally changing summer daylength, the diapause induced by short daylengths was easier to terminate than diapause induced by long daylengths. When naturally induced aestivating and hibernating pupae were kept under natural conditions, aestivating pupae had a long diapause (mean 155 days) and wide range of emergence (90 days), whereas hibernating pupae had a short diapause (mean 105 days) and a relatively synchronized emergence (lasted 30 days). Finally, the ecological significance of photoperiodic regulation of diapause duration is discussed.

N2  - Larval diapause development and termination and some characteristics of cold hardiness in Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) were studied under field conditions in northern Greece. P. gossypiella overwintering larvae were sampled at 20 to 30 day intervals and subjected to two photoperiodic regimes at 20°C. In larvae kept under a long-day photoperiod (16L : 8D) diapause development was accelerated compared to those kept under a short-day photoperiod (8L : 16D). There was no difference in response to the two photoperiods after February. Mean number of days to pupation of P. gossypiella overwintering larvae decreased progressively through the sampling period, from November to April. Chilling is not a prerequisite but does accelerate diapause development. Supercooling points for P. gossypiella overwintering larvae ranged from –14 to –17°C with the majority dying after freezing.

N2  - Chilocorus kuwanae Silvestri is an effective predator of Unaspis euonymi (Comstock), a scale insect harmful to spindle trees (Euonymus europeus L. and E. japonicus Thumb). The feeding behaviour was studied on wild adults, collected from spindle trees in the Botanic Garden of Perugia University, and fed on overwintering U. euonymi females. The insects were exposed to gradually changing constant temperatures (13°-10°-8°-6°-4°-2°-13°-15°C) for a ten day period at each temperature. C. kuwanae adults preyed on the scale also at low temperatures. The number of scales eaten decreased with decreasing temperatures from the initial 13°C to 4°C, and at 2°C the trophic activity of C. kuwanae adults almost stopped although they made brief walks in the petri dishes. At all tested temperatures the ladybirds made holes in or lifted the scale cover and preyed on the female. Sometimes they lifted the scale cover , but did not prey on these U. euonymi females which were destined to die from cold. As the temperature dropped from 13°C to 4°C, the number of females eaten by ladybird males and females did not differ statistically. When the temperature was raised to 13°C and 15°C, the ladybirds resumed feeding. Large differences were recorded between sexes, with females showing a much higher feeding activity than males. Scale cover lifting was most frequent at the beginning of the experiment and then decreased with diminishing temperatures, although no significant difference was recorded among temperatures within the range from 10°C to 4°C. The threshold for trophic activity can be taken as 2°C since we noted that a few (12%) individuals on one day showed predatory activity. At 13°C and 15°C lifting activity rose again but remained at a lower level than at the initial exposure to 13°C. There was no significant difference in activity at 13 and 15°C upon raising the temperature. As for total number of U. euonymi damaged by C. kuwanae the trend in damage revealed the same pattern as for number of scales eaten. At the final exposure to 15°C, 60% of C. kuwanae females laid eggs. Our data demonstrate that C. kuwanae can reduce U. euonymi populations in a submediterranean environment even in winter when the range of temperatures is similar to that tested in this experiment.

N2  - The amount of the trail pheromone substance, 3-ethyl-2,5-dimethylpyrazine, of the leaf-cutting ant Atta sexdens sexdens (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) increases with increasing size of the ant from 0 to 35 ng per individual. The compounds 2,5-dimethylpyrazine and trimethylpyrazine are also consistently present. Trails of venom gland extracts are followed with unequal fidelity by different castes. Minor workers follow best, mediums least well. Workers walk sinuously on narrow trails and less sinuously on wider trails up to 9 mm. Trails wider than 9 mm are not followed. The optimum concentration of pheromone on synthetic trails lies between 15 and 150 pg cm–1. Given a choice of concentrations at a trail branch, workers always choose the more concentrated. Workers showed slight preference for a trail made with venom gland secretion from their own, over that from an alien colony, but there is no preference for a trail that contains Dufour gland secretion additionally.

N2  - The fresh weight, dry weight, and C and N content of the eggs, egg shells and neonate larvae of several satyrines were measured. This was done in order to assess the specificity of the composition of the egg and larvae, the phylogenetic or ecological nature of the variation and the existence of structural constraints on the composition of the offspring. All the traits investigated were found to be highly species-specific. The nature of the variation was not primarily phylogenetic, suggesting that the composition of the offspring has an ecological meaning. However, only a slight association was detected between three life history traits or habitat features and the compositions of the eggs or larvae, namely: female egg dropping was associated with a high C content of the eggs, xerophily with a high C : N ratio, and a high content of N in the larvae with egg diapause. The evidence for intra-specific allometry between the traits investigated and egg weight varied among the species, suggesting that the slope of such relationship may be a specific feature. There was a close to isometric relationship between C and N contents in every species. Therefore simple C : N ratios are independent of egg size, hence they can be used directly in comparative studies. Across species analyses indicated that small offspring contained a proportionally low amount of carbon and had a high dry matter content, suggesting that selection for small eggs was accompanied by selection for an enhanced proportion of nitrogen per egg. Finally, the species with large adult females invested comparatively more nitrogen per egg, which indicates a potential, constraint-based advantage of large adult size.

N2  - In Mediterranean habitats, the specialist butterfly Euphydryas aurinia oviposits on Lonicera implexa. Previous work has shown that ovipositing females select and lay a higher number of egg clusters on certain plants. In this paper the results of a field study aimed at assessing whether females use plant size and/or plant or leaf greenness (i.e., chlorophyll concentrations) as cues for oviposition are described. Size of plants did not appear to be an important factor in determining host plant selection, probably because even small plants provide enough resources for the young larvae to reach the diapausing stage and because last instar larvae, the most likely to face resource depletion, can move great distances in search of food. Measurements of both spectral reflectance and chlorophyll concentration of plants failed to reveal differences between host and non-host plants. On the other hand, reflectance and chlorophyll concentration of leaves were found to be important in oviposition choice as egg clusters were generally located on the greenest leaves with the highest chlorophyll contents. This suggests that females use visual cues to select the leaves that will provide optimal growth opportunities for newly hatched larvae. Although there was some indication that plants receiving a greater number of egg clusters also had more leaves of high chlorophyll content, multiple egg batches on single plants could also be a consequence of females being attracted by the presence of conspecific egg clusters.

N2  - While the ultimate causes and adaptive significance of sexual size dimorphism (SSD) have been extensively studied, the developmental mechanisms behind this phenomenon have received little attention. Going through an additional larval instar may form a specific way of achieving SSD in arthropods. In the present study, the mechanisms of SSD determination of two lymantriid moths, with marked SSD, were studied. In both species, females tended to go through an additional instar compared to males, and form pupae that were more than twice the weight of the males. To reveal the role of an extra instar, larval growth was monitored in the laboratory and the growth parameters were analysed as dependent on sex and developmental type (number of instars). Prolongation of growth by means of adding an additional larval instar in females turned out to be the key mechanism in the determination of the highly female-biased SSD in the species studied. There is thus a developmental mechanism available that permits achieving a larger size by means of extending the growth period. This provides evidence against constraint-based evolutionary explanations for body sizes in insects. There was no considerable accumulation of SSD during earlier larval life when females went through more instars than males. In contrast, in those cases in which males and females had the same number of instars, SSD accumulated gradually during the course of several larval instars. Longer growing period turned out to be a crucial mechanism leading to the female-biased SSD even when instar number did not differ between sexes, although higher instantaneous relative growth rates of females also played a complementary role in the latter case. Within sexes, an additional instar was characteristic of initially smaller larvae, as predicted by the "threshold size" hypothesis.

N2  - The oviposition sites of the xerophilous ecotype of M. alcon (= "Maculinea rebeli") were surveyed in the managed (transitional) zone of the Aggtelek National Park and Biosphere Reserve in Northern Hungary. The M. alcon population is distributed over a territory of about 3 ha. In 2001, habitat reconstruction with selective cutting of shrubs and mowing, was started in this area. The number of stems of Gentiana cruciata (the food plant for the young larvae) and M. alcon eggs layed on them were counted in a selected area within this 3 ha: before (in 1992, 1993 and 1998) and after habitat reconstruction (in 2003, 2004 and 2005). In 2004 and 2005, a detailed study was carried out in order to detect potentially significant factors influencing the egg laying behaviour of females. The average number of intact flowering stems per quadrate was 2.68 and was clearly decreasing before management started. In contrast, there were five times higher (15.06) and increasing numbers of stems per quadrate right after habitat reconstruction. The two periods also differed in the percentage of flowering stems, which was very low before habitat reconstruction. The average number of eggs per square was low (6.8) and fluctuated considerably before management started. In contrast, the egg count was high (160.3) and increased consistently after the site was managed. The short grass sward created in the area proved to be advantageous both for the growth of the host plant and for the Maculinea population. The egg laying preference of the females was positively affected by the number of stems per clump, the height of the stems, the number of whorls with flowers and the difference between the height of the stems of the host plant and the surrounding vegetation. Significantly more eggs were found on large clumps of stems than expected on the basis of their availability for egg-laying. Egg counts were strongly correlated with all the measured characteristics of the food plant, which significantly correlated with each other. The interaction term indicated that the number of whorls with flowers is slightly more influential for egg laying than the other characteristics. There were significantly more eggs on the adaxial surface of the leaves and flower buds than on other parts of the food plant.

N2  - Phylogenetic relationships among Palaearctic Ribes and/or Onagraceae inhabiting Aphis species from five countries were examined using mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I (CO-I) and nuclear gene elongation factor 1 a (EF-1a) sequences. There was no major conflict between the trees obtained from two data sets; nodes with strong bootstrap support from one analysis never contradicted those strongly supported by the other analysis. Palaearctic species of the subgenus Bursaphis (= "grossulariae” species group of the genus Aphis) form a monophyletic group within the genus Aphis. All these analyses indicated that Aphis grossulariae and A. schneideri are close relatives, which is supported by the information on experimental and probably also natural hybridisation. Our data indicate the independent colonisation of Ribes spp. by two species groups of the genus Aphis: A. triglochinis (subgenus Aphis s. str.), and A. grossulariae and A. schneideri (subgenus Bursaphis). Once the subgenus Bursaphis (and other subgenera) is accepted, the subgenus Aphis s. str. will require further subdivision.

N2  - The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), is a notorious insect pest of cruciferous plants. To examine the pattern and magnitude of genetic variation in this species in China a portion of the mitochondrial (mt) COI gene of P. xylostella, collected at six Chinese and two Korean localities, which cover ~2,151,600 km2, was sequenced. Sequence analysis of the 681-bp mt COI gene from 80 individuals resulted in 16 haplotypes, ranging in sequence divergence from 0.1% (one nucleotide) to 0.9% (six nucleotides). One nucleotide position among 16 variable sites was a transversional substitution and the remaining positions were transitional substitutions. No position resulted in amino acid substitution. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all haplotypes were highly interrelated and no discernable haplotype group was found. From a geographical perspective, most haplotypes were found singly at one or two localities, with three haplotypes widely distributed. Little genetic differentiation (FST = –0.038–0.309) and a high rate of female migration (Nm = 1.117 – infinite) between Chinese populations suggests that dispersal over long distances is a major factor in the demography of this species.

N2  - Phylogenetic relationships of European Maniola butterflies are reconstructed using molecular sequences from two regions of the mitochondrial DNA, cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cytb). A total of 988 base pairs (486 for Cytb, and 502 for COI) were aligned for 15 individuals of Maniola and an outgroup species. The phylogenetic tree obtained through Bayesian inference analysis of the combined data sets shows evidence that the island endemic M. chia is indistinguishable from M. jurtina on the basis of the mtDNA genes studied. Net nucleotide divergence between M. jurtina and M. chia is 0.4%, but 2% between the M. jurtina and the M. nurag clade. A phenetically distinct entity of individuals from Sardinia appears to be a hybrid between M. nurag and M. jurtina. The southern and northern European ecotypes of M. jurtina, which differ in the summer aestivation period of the southern type, are not structured genetically at the level of coding mtDNA genes. Divergence time between M. nurag and M. jurtina was estimated to be 1.1 to 1.2 million years. Speciation most likely took place in the early Pleistocene as a consequence of the isolation of Sardinia, when the sea reflooded the Mediterranean basin after the Messinian crisis (about 5 million years ago).

In this paper the larva of H. opis Hinton, 1976 is described based on material collected in the Cameron Highlands (Malaysia) and the conspecificity with co-existing adults tested using sequences of one nuclear (5’ end of 18S rRNA) and three mitochondrial gene fragments (5’ end of the large ribosomal unit + tRNAleu + 5’ end of the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1; 5’ end of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I; and a fragment of cytochrome b) with a total of ca. 2,600 bp. This is the first example of the use of molecular data to match different life stages within the family Elmidae. The larva of H. opis has a subcylindrical body typical of many other elmid genera; abdominal segments 1–7 with preserved pleura; and ninth segment with oval operculum. The last instar larvae have clearly visible prominent spiracles on mesothorax and abdominal segments 1–8. The phylogenetic position of Hedyselmis in relation to Graphelmis was investigated using molecular data for three species of Graphelmis plus a selection of other Elmidae genera. Hedyselmis opis is nested within Graphelmis, confirming their close relationship and suggesting that their status requires taxonomic revision.

N2  - A review of all known descriptions of immature stages of the species of the genera Scaeva Fabricius, 1805, Ischiodon Sack, 1913 and Simosyrphus Bigot, 1882 is presented using SEM illustrations. The third instar larval and/or pupal morphology of Scaeva dignota (Rondani, 1857), Scaeva mecogramma (Bigot, 1860) and Simosyrphus grandicornis (Macquart, 1842) are newly described. All species of the genera studied in this paper are very similar for all the studied characters of their immature stages, including the chaetotaxy. Molecular characters of the mitochondrial cox1 gene (1128bp) were used for inferring relationships of the studied taxa. The nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) was additionally applied for species delimitation of the closely related species Scaeva selenitica and S. dignota. The Palaearctic Scaeva species could be split into two groups based on the analysis of morphology of posterior respiratory process. These groups were previously diagnosed as S. selenitica-group [i.e., S. selenitica (Meigen, 1822), S. dignota (Rondani, 1857), S. mecogramma (Bigot, 1860)] and S. pyrastri-group [i.e., S. pyrastri (Linnaeus, 1758), S. albomaculata (Macquart, 1842), S. latimaculata (Brunetti, 1923)]. Semiscaeva Kuznetzov, 1985 and Scaeva Fabricius, 1805 are the available names for these two natural groups that should be classified as subgenera; the former name is proposed for S. selenitica-group and the latter for S. pyrastri-group. Mecoscaeva Kuznetzov, 1985 syn. n. is transferred as a junior synonym of the subgenus Semiscaeva Kuznetzov, 1985 according to the principle of the first reviser. Based on the analysis of immature stages, the generic name Ischiodon Sack, 1913 syn. n. is proposed as a junior synonym of the genus Simosyrphus Bigot, 1882. The similarity of immature stages between Scaeva s. str. and Simosyrphus grandicornis Macquart, 1842, Simosyrphus aegyptius (Wiedemann, 1830) comb. n. and Simosyrphus scutellaris (Fabricius, 1805) comb. n. is discussed. All the proposed subgeneric and generic taxa based on morphological studies received high support employing molecular characters.

N2  - The species of the Isophya major-group (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae: Phaneropterinae), are reviewed. I. major Brunner von Wattenwyl and I. mavromoustakisi Uvarov are redescribed. Two new species are described; Isophya mersinensis Sevgili & Çıplak sp. n. and Isophya salmani Sevgili & Heller sp. n. from south Anatolia. Illustrations of morphology and male calling song are provided and a detailed comparison of the four species in the group is presented. We conclude that these four species constitute a natural group in sharing male cerci with two or more denticles not ordered in a line, a character unique to this species group within the genus. From an evaluation of their morphology and song characteristics, relationships among the species in the group are I. major + (I. mersinensis sp. n. + (I. salmani + I. mavromoustakisi). Based on the the distribution pattern and habitat preference, we concluded that the division of I. salmani and I. mavromoustakisi was a vicariant event resulting from the separation of Cyprus and Anatolia due to reflooding of the Mediterranean after the Messinian salinity crisis at the beginning of the Pliocene, around 5 My ago.

N2  - The microanatomy of several oribatid and one acaridid mite was studied to determine the role of free cells (haemocytes) in mites. Mites from the field as well as laboratory cultures were observed and analyzed histologically using Masson triple stain. The mites were offered various foods and kept in fluctuating moisture conditions. The presence of haemocytes was significantly correlated with the transport between internal organs of various substance. Three types of transport were recorded: (i) enzymes into the alimentary tract, including the incorporation of haemocytes into the gut walls. This process seemed to be correlated with the amount and type of food and frequently with the presence of internal extraintestinal bacteria associated with mesenchyma; (ii) metabolites, like guanine from mesenchyma into the alimentary tract followed by expulsion from the body via the gut. This process is correlated with food of high nitrogen content or dry conditions; (iii) resorption of nutrients from eggs during an induced quiescent state under unfavourable conditions by small haemocytes.

N2  - Differences in the karyology of two species, Centricnemus leucogrammus and Peritelus familiaris (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), were investigated in order to elucidate their taxonomic position of the taxa. Previously both species were placed in one genus whereas the latest taxonomic revision puts them in separate genera. Cytogenetic analysis of P. familiaris and C. leucogrammus showed significant differences in karyotype structure and confirmed their present taxonomic status. The diploid set of C. leucogrammus consists of 22 chromosomes with a fundamental number of arms (FN) of 45 and little variation in morphology and length. Peritelus familiaris has 24 chromosomes with FN of 47 and a more diverse karyotype. The karyotype evolution might have occured by centric fissions of autosomes. At pachytene and diplotene in spermatocytes, each chromosome bivalent showed a small band of pericentric heterochromatin. The bands were hardly visible or undetectable in other stages of spermatogenesis, namely mitotic metaphase, diakinesis, metaphase I and II. The nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) were active at premeiotic stages and early meiosis, but invisible at meiotic metaphase I, metaphase II, and mitotic metaphase. These results indicate the usefulness of cytogenetic methods in taxonomic evaluations.

N2  - When puparia of the onion maggot Delia antiqua were preexposed to 5°C for 5 days starting at different time points after pupariation, a large increase in survival after exposure to –20°C for 5 days was observed only when pre-exposure was initiated at 3–6 days after pupariation. The increase in cold hardiness was not associated with a large increase in the trehalose content of the puparia. The supercooling point of the puparia naturally decreased from –18 to –27°C in the first three days after pupariation, and pre-exposure to 5°C did not have an additional effect. Thus, factors responsible for the enhancement of cold hardiness by acclimation other than trehalose and supercooling point should be sought. The period of responsiveness to cold acclimation coincided with the time soon after head evagination, which corresponds to "pupation" in lepidopteran insects. The puparia appear to be physiologically flexible for a short time after head evagination, and able to adapt their physiology to the contemporary cold environment.

Annual augmentation of O. cornuta populations was more than five-fold during the six years of our study. This was achieved by watering the soil near the Osmia augmentation shelters used for nest building. However, populations of O. rufa under the same treatment only doubled annually. Data are also presented on sex ratios in these managed populations, the sex ratio being an important factor in increasing population numbers and raising pollination efficacy. Sex ratio values (male : female) varied from 1.46 : 1 to 3.22 : 1 in the populations of O. cornuta and from 1.35 : 1 to 2.68 : 1 in those of O. rufa.

N2  - A survey of soil fauna in Poland revealed 30 cases of centipedes carrying mites of the sub-order Uropodina. The 155 phoretic deutonymphs collected belonged to two species of Uropodina – Oodinychus ovalis (C.L. Koch, 1839) and Uroobovella pulchella (Berlese, 1904). These mites displayed a high degree of selectivity in their choice of carrier. The only species of centipede transporting mites was Lithobius forficatus (Linnaeus, 1758), despite the presence of 30 other species in the same habitats. It is possible that the large size and relatively fast speed of movement of this centipede make it a very good mite carrier. The majority of the mites were located on the sides of the centipedes, on segments near the anterior end. The high selectivity in the choice of carrier as well as the point of attachment suggests adaptation by the mites for phoresy by L. forficatus.

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships of the three major species groups of Tribolium (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) were inferred using the simultaneous analysis of 642 bp of the most conserved part of mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and 448–452 bp of mt 16S rDNA. High sequence divergence was observed for both genes even among sibling species. The analysis of the combined segments of COI and 16S rDNA sequences produced a phylogenetic tree with moderate level of confidence. The tree topology showed monophyly of the genus Tribolium whose species were separated into three groups: "brevicornis” group (with T. brevicornis as the only representative), "castaneum” group (with T. castaneum, T. freemani, T. madens and T. audax) and "confusum” group (with T. confusum, T. anaphe and T. destructor). Sibling species pairs T. castaneum – T. freemani and T. madens – T. audax are clearly resolved. The preliminary results presented here give moderate support to the previously proposed phylogeny based on morphological data.

N2  - Modality in the supercooling points of cold tolerant but freezing intolerant terrestrial arthropods has proved a pragmatically reliable means of distinguishing between summer and winter cold hardiness in such species. This paper proposes an ecologically realistic method of modal analysis which may either be used in lieu of the traditional separation of supercooling points into "high" and "low" groups, or as a complementary assessment of the risk of freezing mortality. Instead of a posteriori determinations of modal break points, animal supercooling points are assigned a priori to one of four categories of cold hardiness: (1) summer cold-hardy; (2) semi-cold-hardy; (3) cold-hardy; and (4) winter cold-hardy. Each category is identified by the temperature range within which arthropods can be expected to freeze. The temperature ranges assigned to each category are based on a conservative, but realistic, assessment of the temperatures at which animals can be expected to freeze at a given point in the season. The approach has greater discriminatory power than traditional bimodal descriptors (i.e."summer" and "winter" cold-hardy), as well as allowing animal supercooling points to be related to the temperatures they actually experience in their habitats. Thus, for example, animals considered "summer" cold-hardy according to conventional analysis may actually be "semi-cold-hardy" with supercooling points well within the safety margin of minimum ambient temperatures.

N2  - The taxonomic status of Alcon Blues in Central and Western Europe (conventionally: Maculinea alcon and M. rebeli) is confused. Some authors distinguish them as separate species within the M. alcon species group, while others consider them to be subspecies or simply ecological forms. Our aim was to study the geographical versus food plant pattern of genetic differentiation among several populations of these taxa in Northern Hungary. Imagines were collected from 11 localities between 2000 and 2003. M. alcon feeding on G. pneumonanthe from three subregions and on G. cruciata from two subregions were analysed. Enzyme polymorphism was analysed at 16 enzyme loci using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In the analysis of the data, F-statistics were computed and the total genetic variation partitioned into within and between population components. Nei’s genetic distances were calculated and a UPGMA dendrogram constructed on the basis of the distance matrix. Hierarchical F-statistics and AMOVA were computed to study the pattern of genetic differentiation among the samples. PCA analysis was also carried out using the allele frequencies of the samples. The results of all analyses indicated strong differentiation among the samples. A sizeable portion of this variation was detected among the samples/generations collected from the same population. The distribution of the between population variation did not exhibit a clear split between the two food plant groups. In addition, the FST values computed using a restricted data set suggested significant differentiation among the subregions. The results of AMOVA and PCA also indicated that the geographic pattern was more expressed in the between sample variation than the conventional taxonomic pattern.

N2  - Fruit of two almond, Prunus amygdalus Linnaeus, cultivars (Retsou and Truoito) containing diapausing larvae of Eurytoma amygdali Enderlein, were collected in early August from coastal areas in northern Greece. Some larvae were removed from the fruit and maintained singly in open plastic vials and others left in the fruit until the end of the low-temperature period. They were kept at a low temperature of 10°C from the beginning, or after 8 weeks at 20°C. The larvae were subsequently maintained at 20°C and whether they completed the two diapause stages was recorded for 60 more weeks. When the larvae in vials, were kept initially for 8 weeks at 20°C, most of those from Retsou and all of those Truoito almonds completed the first stage of diapause. Of the larvae in the fruits, most of those in Truoito but less than 50% of those in Retsou almonds completed the first stage of diapause after 8 weeks at 20°C. Larvae from different orchards and different almond cultivars differed in diapause intensity. When the larvae were kept at a low temperature of 10°C from the beginning for 4, 8 or 16 weeks and then at 20°C they completed the second diapause stage synchronously, but the time of completion was delayed, and depended on the duration of the low temperature treatment. In several cases the time to diapause completion was bimodally distributed and the relative size of peak depended on the duration of the early exposure to low temperature.

The long-winged (LW) morph appeared from mid-June to September, whereas the short-winged (SW) morph appeared from September to mid-June. Individuals overwintered in either the adult or juvenile stage. The seasonal shift in wing morphology was linked to the overwintering stage. Individuals that hatched in May became SW adults in September–October and then overwintered, whereas those that hatched in June and July overwintered as juveniles and became LW adults in June of the following year. The life cycle of both morphs was univoltine. Reproductive benefits and constraints of each wing morph of G. orientalis are compared.

N2  - Ptomascopus morio of both sexes are attracted to vertebrate carcasses, a necessary resource for reproduction. The stage during reproduction that resource defense was most intense and the hypothesis that large beetles were better competitors and sired a larger share of the offspring were supported and tested. Male-male aggression (pushing, biting and mounting) was commonly observed before and during oviposition, but rarely after the larvae hatched. Few female-female aggressive interactions were observed at any time. Parentage analysis of the offspring of six groups of two males and two females each reproducing on a separate carcass revealed that the large males sired more of the offspring than small males. Paternity analysis, using AFLP markers, revealed that larger males had higher paternity than smaller males, but the number of eggs produced by each female did not differ between large and small females. This suggests that competition among males is intense until the end of oviposition and that resident (large) males can acquire more mates and sire more offspring than smaller males; competition among females was not evident at any time.

N2  - The oviposition deterring effects of fresh larval tracks of Cheilomenes sexmaculata (F.), Ceratomegilla undecimnotata (Schneider), Cycloneda limbifer Casey, and Harmonia dimidiata (F.) on C. sexmaculata females were compared in standard laboratory choice tests. Moreover, the persistence of intraspecific effects of C. sexmaculata larval tracks were investigated. Fresh tracks of C. sexmaculata, C. limbifer and C. undecimnotata larvae effectively deterred C. sexmaculata females from ovipositing. The effect of fresh larval tracks of H. dimidiata was not statistically significant. The oviposition-deterring effects of 10 d-old conspecific larval tracks were considerably lower than those of fresh tracks, but remained significant. Clutch sizes were smaller in the blank test without larval tracks than in choice tests with fresh tracks of conspecific, C. limbifer, C. undecimnotata, H. dimidiata larvae and with 10 d-old tracks of conspecific larvae. The study indicates that semiochemicals in the tracks of conspecific and heterospecific coccinellid larvae can contribute considerably to the spacing of C. sexmaculata offspring among prey resources of differing quality and that conspecific as well as heterospecific larval tracks can influence clutch size.

N2  - Insects experience important selection pressures from their parasitoids, which affect both their population dynamics and their evolutionary responses. The interaction between the egg parasitoid Oomyzus galerucivorus Graham (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) and its chrysomelid host Galeruca tanaceti L. (Coleoptera: Galerucinae) was investigated with the particular aim determining whether the chrysomelid host can escape its parasitoid by ovipositing late in the year as early as September. Although the leaf beetle and its parasitoid emerge in April, G. tanaceti starts to oviposit after spending the summer in reproductive diapause. The objective was to determine, whether the small parasitic wasp can parasitise its host’s eggs even at the end of its host’s reproductive season in December, when temperatures are low. Beetle oviposition, parasitism rates and temperatures were measured on three comparable mesoxerophytic grassland sites over the coarse of a season. Beetle oviposition, but not parasitism, was significantly positively dependent on temperature. Rate of oviposition decreased over the oviposition period with decrease in temperature. In contrast, after a lag phase of 1–2 weeks at the beginning of the oviposition period in September beetle egg clutches were parasitised at a constant rate until the end of the season in December. Host eggs were parasitised even at mean daily temperatures of 0–6°C. Thus the tansy leaf beetle does not escape from egg parasitism by ovipositing late in the season in central Germany.

N2  - Two species of the Chrysoperla carnea complex: Ch. carnea sensu Henry and Ch. lucasina, occur in the crop environment in western France. Within the framework of a conservation biological control program for protected seed crops, the pollen consumption of these common green lacewings was investigated. The diverticulum contents of collected specimens were analysed to determine their food preference. Ch. carnea sensu Henry and Ch. lucasina are opportunistic feeders, which are attracted to large patches of flowering plants. The establishment of monitoring an attractive environment for these predators is discussed.

N2  - To understand the evolution of insect gut symbionts it is important to determine how they are passed on to the next generation. We studied this process in Erwinia species bacteria that inhabit the gut of western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). This is a polyphagous herbivore and a world-wide pest in agricultural crops. With bacteria in the gut, the thrips larval development time can be shorter and its oviposition rate higher compared to bacteria-free thrips. Bacteria are not directly transmitted from mother to offspring, but larvae acquire bacteria from the leaves right after they hatch. These gut bacteria are present on the leaves on feeding sites used by other thrips before the larvae arrive, probably because these other thrips have deposited bacteria via faeces or regurgitation. In this study we addressed the question whether the transmission route of symbiotic bacteria influences the thrips feeding behaviour, and determined the feeding and oviposition preference of thrips, by giving them a choice between leaves with and leaves without prior grazing by other western flower thrips. This was studied for thrips with and thrips without gut bacteria. Young larvae prefer to feed on leaves that where grazed before by other thrips and females prefer to oviposit on these grazed leaves. These results are in contradiction to earlier studies that have found that thrips larvae fitness is lower on thrips damaged plants than on clean plants. This behaviour does however promote the establishment of gut bacteria in the thrips. The factors determining the preference for thrips-damaged leaves may be the physical leaf damage or odours that are produced by the plant, the bacteria or both.

N2  - Encarsia bimaculata (Heraty & Polaszek) is an abundant parasitoid of Bemisia tabaci in southern China. The effects of constant temperatures on a range of life history traits, including development, survival of immatures, longevity and reproduction of adults, were studied in the laboratory. The developmental period from egg to adult ranged from 34.3 ± 0.4 d at 20°C to 8.7 ± 0.6 d at 32°C, A total of 181.4 ± 2.4 degree-days were required to complete development with a lower developmental threshold of 11.6 ± 0.3°C. The survivorship of E. bimaculata from 2nd instar to adult varied from 81.3 ± 1.7% at 20°C to 91.0 ± 1.8% at 26°C. Average adult female longevity was 8.4 ± 0.7 d at 20°C and 5.4 ± 0.4 d at 32°C, and daily production of offspring peaked at 29°C with 4.5 offspring per female. The maximum oviposition occurred three days after adult emergence at 23, 26, 29 and 32°C, and four days at 20°C. Total number of offspring produced per female varied from 24.3 ± 2.0 at 32°C to 29.3 ± 2.9 at 20°C. The maximum intrinsic rate of increase (rm) was 0.2163 ± 0.013 at 29°C, followed by 0.2062 ± 0.022 at 32°C. Results indicate that E. bimaculata reaches its maximum biological potential at temperatures ranging from 26°C to 32°C with 29°C being the optimal temperature.

N2  - Whilst sexually transmitted pathogens and parasites are common on insects and other animals, the factors affecting their incidence are currently uncertain. In order to understand the factors important in determining the presence of sexually transmitted parasites, it would be helpful to have information on intraspecific variation in incidence, as the causes of this variation are likely to reflect the likely causes of the presence/absence of sexually transmitted parasites across species. We therefore mapped the incidence of the parasite Coccipolipus hippodamiae within Europe on its primary host, the ladybird Adalia bipunctata. We observed that C. hippodamiae was present widely in Central, Southern and Eastern Europe, but was absent from northerly and north-western populations. The cause of this pattern of incidence variation is discussed, with particular reference to the voltinism of the host. We also note that the distribution of C. hippodamiae on A. bipunctata is not congruent with that of another sexually transmitted parasite of this species, Hesperomyces virescens.

N2  - The laboulbenialean fungi occur throughout the world and are closely associated with a range of arthropods, including many coleopteran hosts. Throughout the summer of 2004, coccinellids were collected from a Bluegrass savanna woodland ecosystem, dominated by blue ash Fraxinus quadrangulata and Chinkapin Oak Quercus muehlenbergii, and the adults were examined for the presence of Hesperomyces virescens using binocular and scanning electron microscopy. Over 80% of adult Harmonia axyridis, a species previously reported as having a persistent association with the fungus, were infected. No significant differences were observed in incidence on male and female hosts, however, the distribution of fungus differed between sexes. Female H. axyridis had a greater percentage of infection on their elytron compared to other parts of their body whilst male infection was concentrated around their elytra, legs and abdomen. Although infection rates were significantly lower, we report, for the first time, the presence of this fungus on the hosts Cycloneda munda, Brachiacantha quadripunctata and Psyllobora vigintimaculata. This is the first study documenting the incidence of this insect-associated fungus with these native coccinellids of North America. In the samples collected from the Bluegrass savanna, two species (Coleomegilla maculata and Hyperaspis signata) were not infected by this fungus.

N2  - Understanding the genetic mechanisms of morphological evolution is one of the greatest challenges in evolutionary biology and for such studies sexually dimorphic traits in closely related species are of prime interest. In the Drosophila bipectinata species complex, which consists of four closely related species, namely D. bipectinata, D. parabipectinata, D. malerkotliana and D. pseudoananassae, the pattern of sex combs (a sexually dimorphic trait) is found to be highly diversified. The present investigation documents some unique and new sex comb phenotypes and demarcates intra- and interspecific variations in the sex comb pattern among the four species and their hybrids. There is remarkable similarity in sex comb pattern of D. bipectinata and D. parabipectinata but it differs from that of D. malerkotliana and D. pseudoananassae, which is in consistent with the phylogenetic relationships among the four species traced out by cytological, biochemical and molecular studies. The genetic basis of inheritance of sex comb patterns, its plausible implication with biogeographical distribution of species and the relationship between degree of hybridization and phylogenetic proximity have been addressed.

N2  - Two principal pheromones are essential in all cockroach sexual behavioral sequences: the volatile sex attractant pheromone released by one partner for long distance attraction and an aphrodisiac sex pheromone produced exclusively by male tergal glands for female mounting and feeding behavior. In the Blaberinae subfamily, the female produces volatile sex attractant pheromones and the male, aphrodisiacs. A close relationship is known to exist between the release of these pheromonal signals from specific glands and the corresponding behaviors (female calling posture and male wing raising). However, in this cockroach group, no data on the glands secreting sex attractant pheromones and aphrodisiacs have been available until now. In seven species of the Blaberinae subfamily: Blaberus colosseus, B. craniifer, B. discoidalis, Blaptica interior, Byrsotria fumigata, Eublaberus distanti and E. posticus; one species of the Zetoborinae subfamily: Schultesia lampyridiformis; one species of the Epilamprinae subfamily: Epilampra maya and one species of the Panesthiinae subfamily, Panesthia sp., the females possess all pygidial glands on the 10 th tergite and the males have tergal glands situated anteriorly, generally on tergites T1 and T2. These glands are formed of type 3 glandular units with two cells, i.e. glandular and canal cells. The uniform presence of female pygidial glands and male tergal glands explains their relationship with their corresponding sexual behaviors.

A key to the subgenera of Megadytes Sharp, 1882 is presented. In a cladistic analysis of third-instar larval characters, Megadytes is resolved as non-monophyletic; the species of Cybistrini studied, except those included in the subgenus Trifurcitus Brinck, 1945, share three synapomorphies: (i) medial projection of frontoclypeus truncate apically, with many apical setae directed forwards; (ii) lateral projections of frontoclypeus project forwards, not flattened; and (iii) median process of prementum rounded apically. The clade composed of the subgenera Megadytes s. str., Paramegadytes Trémouilles & Bachmann, 1980 and Bifurcitus Brinck, 1945 along with Cybister lateralimarginalis (De Geer, 1774) is well supported by three synapomorphies: (i) head capsule subrectangular and (ii) distal third of mandible more strongly projected inwards, (iii) with a ring of long, hair-like setae. The two species of the subgenus Paramegadytes have bilobed lateral projections on the frontoclypeus. Megadytes (M.) marginithorax (Perty, 1830) is characterized by the very narrow notches between the medial and lateral projections of frontoclypeus. No synapomorphies were discovered to group together the two species of the subgenus Bifurcitus.

N2  - Calling songs of the sibling species Cicada barbara and C. orni were studied in sympatric and allopatric populations on the Iberian Peninsula, where the distribution ranges of both species overlap. No difference was found in any acoustic property for the sympatric and allopatric populations of C. barbara studied and only one variable (minimum frequency) was significantly different between sympatric and allopatric populations of C. orni. No hybrids with intermediate songs were found and no character displacement in the calling song was detected. It is very likely that these species were already considerably differentiated when they met on the Iberian Peninsula. Particularly, premating (or even postmating) isolating mechanisms (according to Mayr’s Biological Species Concept) or different specific-mate recognition systems (in the view of the Paterson’s Recognition Concept of Species) were most likely already present, which prevented hybridization between this pair of species. It is assumed that the calling songs are the most important premating isolating mechanism corresponding to the specific-mate recognition systems of these species of cicadas.

N2  - The species of the Poecilimon heroicus-group occur around the Caucasus (from north-eastern Turkey to south-eastern Ukraine). We describe the diagnostic morphological characters of all these species and the male calling song of three of the four species. Based on this data the following phylogenetic relationship is derived (P. tschorochensis (P. tricuspis (P. heroicus, P. bifenestratus))). Within the genus Poecilimon, the species can be recognised by a relatively wide pronotum and large tegmina. In one species, Poecilimon tschorochensis Adelung, 1907 (type species of the monotypic genus Artvinia Karabag, 1962, syn. n.; P. rammei Miram, 1938, syn. n.), the tegmina are very large and the song has unusually low spectral components. This species produced di-syllabic echemes at intervals of about 10 s. In two other species of the group, P. heroicus and P. bifenestratus, the calling song of males consists of an uninterrupted dense sequence of long syllables (syllable duration around 0.5 s; ca. 1 syllable/s at 20°C). In these species the auditory spiracles are reduced in size in both sexes, and the females have extremely small tegmina and are unable to respond to the male song acoustically, which would be typical for Phaneropteridae. The change in communication from acoustically responding to mute females has not been previously documented within a group of closely related species.

Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA suggested that BiSP gene is a single copy gene. The cDNA encoding BiSP was expressed as a 28-kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect cells and the recombinant BiSP showed activity in a protease enzyme assay. BiSP was specifically expressed in the midgut of B. ignitus queens, males, and workers, suggesting that the BiSP is a gut enzyme involved in the digestion of dietary proteins.

N2  - Desiccation resistance of adult males and females of the midge, Belgica antarctica (Diptera: Chironomidae) was evaluated to determine how this short-lived stage maintains water balance in the dry Antarctic environment. Both sexes had slightly lower water content (approx. 60%) and a higher dehydration tolerance (>30% water loss) than most other insects. Water loss rates were high and increased rapidly at temperatures above 15°C, indicating that the adult midges are more hygric than many other polar terrestrial arthropods. Water gain was accomplished by free water uptake with minimal or no contribution from absorption of water vapor or metabolic water production. Parameters related to water balance did not differ among populations from different islands. Overall, the high water requirements of the adult midge appear to be a significant challenge and presumably dictate that the adult midges must emerge during the brief period when free water is readily available and seek protected microhabitats that facilitate water retention.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to determine the factors that are involved in termination of a non-diapause type of ovarian arrest in the adult macropterous females of a flightless bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.), reared under a long-day (18L : 6D) photoperiod. Application of an active analogue of juvenile hormone, methoprene, to adult macropterous females kept under the above conditions induced precocious termination of ovarian arrest and shortened the length of the pre-oviposition period. The results indicate that a temporary ovarian arrest in spontaneously fasting long-day macropterous females results from a deficiency of juvenile hormone. The length of the pre-oviposition period was shortened and ovarian arrest terminated also by de-alation, high temperature and by a prolonged period of starvation. Mating of long-day macropterous females with reproductively active males had no effect on the length of the pre-oviposition period. There was a relationship between the length of the starvation period and the post-feeding pre-oviposition period. The longer the starvation period, the shorter the period from when food was supplied to first oviposition. The results indicate that depletion of the fat body reserves resulting from prolonged fasting, followed by resumption of food intake are pre-requisites for full activation of the corpus allatum and egg development, and play a role in completion and termination of non-diapause ovarian arrest in long-day macropterous females. This phenomenon was never observed in short-day brachypterous females in reproductive diapause.

N2  - The influence of photoperiod on the thermal requirements for development was discovered for the first time in insects during experiments on the linden-bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus. The effect of photoperiod on the duration of linden-bug development at five constant temperatures (20, 22, 24, 26 and 28°C) was measured and the thermal requirements for development at three photoperiods (14, 17 and 20h light per day) were calculated. Bugs from four geographic populations were used in these experiments: Pyatigorsk (44°02´N, 43°04´E), Borisovka (50°36´N, 36°01´E), Mikhailov (54°15´N, 39°0´E) and Ryazan (54°36´N, 39°42´E). From the values of individual development times at different temperatures the coefficient of linear regression of development rate (the inverse of the duration) on temperature and the thermal threshold for development were calculated. Both these parameters were found to decrease significantly with decrease in day-length for all four populations studied. It means that at shorter day-lengths nymphal development is less dependent on temperature compared to the development at longer day-lengths. These effects seem to be adaptive. The development times of nymphs at relatively high temperatures (above 24–25°C) are shorter under long-days than under short days which should be advantageous at the height of summer when the days are long and the weather is warm. In the contrast, at relatively low temperatures (below 24–25°C) the nymphs develop significantly faster under short-days than under long days, which is advantageous at the end of summer as it allows the nymphs to reach the adult stage, the only stage capable of overwintering. The influence of photoperiod on the thermal reaction norm appeared to be more or less gradual, i.e. the shorter the day-length the shallower the slope of the regression line of development rate on temperature and the lower the thermal threshold for development. An analysis of the literature shows that this effect of photoperiod on the thermal requirements for development is widespread among insects but has been overlooked by previous authors. The authors conclude that the variation in the development time observed in insects at different seasons, photoperiods or food regimes, or from different populations, etc., are generally due to some modification of the thermal reaction norms and more specifically to differences in the thermal requirements for development.

N2  - Overwintering adults of the water strider, Aquarius paludum were collected from the field in fall and kept under short days (12L : 12D) at 20°C for a week. A control group was then kept at 12L : 12D and fed daily, and three experimental groups were transferred to 15.5L : 8.5D and fed at different frequencies: daily or every 2nd or 3rd day. Temperature was kept at 20°C. Flight behaviour of the adults in the four groups was recorded every 10 days up to the end of the 5th week when the adults were dissected. State of the flight muscles and reproductive organs (ovaries and testes) was recorded. Flight ability of the adults fed every 3rd day (Group 3) was higher than that of those fed daily (Group 1). Seventy percent of the females that were fed every 3rd day (Group 3) remained in diapause for 5 weeks, in spite of the reproduction promoting long-days, while none of the females fed every day remained in diapause (Group 1). Flight muscle histolysis, promoted by long-days, was inhibited by poor feeding conditions. Thus, they can migrate and seek more suitable water bodies rich in food. The modifying effect of the availability of food on the trade-off between reproduction and flight is recorded here for the first time for a carnivorous insect.

N2  - Genetic variation for thermal plasticity plays an important role in the success or failure of a species with respect to the colonization of different thermal habitats and the ability to deal with climatic change. The aim of this paper is to study the relative contribution of the additive and non-additive components of genetic variation for the slope of the temperature reaction norm for juvenile growth rate in the springtail Orchesella cincta. We present the outcome of an artificial selection experiment for steep and flat temperature reaction norms and the results of a parent-offspring heritability experiment. There was a considerable phenotypic variation for the slope of the reaction norm. The selection experiment and the offspring to parent regression analysis, however, yielded no evidence for significant additive genetic variance. There were also no indications for maternal effects. The full-sib analysis, on the other hand, revealed a significant broad sense heritability of 0.76. An unforeseen result was that the slopes of females were steeper than those of males. This influenced the broad sense heritability of the full-sib analysis, since accidental female or male biased broods inflate the estimate of heritability. A randomization test showed that the probability level of the observed "between group" variance on the basis of the sexual differences alone was less than 10–5. From this we conclude that autosomal genetic variation played its own separate role. In conclusion, the thermal reaction norm for growth in juvenile O. cincta is not very much determined by the additive effects of a large number of independent genes, but more likely based on a still unknown but mainly non-additive, partially sex-related genetic mechanism, possibly including both dominance and epistatic effects. Hypotheses about the role of phenotypic plasticity in processes of local adaptation and speciation should thus be alert to such a complex genetic architecture.

N2  - The aphid alarm pheromone is known to trigger wing induction in pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum). In reaction to alarm pheromone, aphids drop off the plant or walk away. While searching for a new feeding site they repeatedly encounter other members of the aphid colony and this increased contact rate is assumed to be important for wing induction ("pseudo-crowding” hypothesis). Because the encounter rate is a function of aphid colony size, wing induction in aphids in the presence of a predator should be a function of the number of aphids on the plant. We placed two, seven or 13 adult pea aphids on bean plants, and exposed the different-sized colonies to synthetic alarm pheromone to test the density-dependence of predator-induced wing induction. The mean percentage of winged morphs among the offspring produced on the plants ranged from 10 to 80 percent and increased both with aphid number and exposure to alarm pheromone. There was no synergy between aphid number and alarm pheromone exposure indicating that both factors are additive. The implications for aphid metapopulation dynamics are discussed.

N2  - Adults of some coccinellid species overwinter in aggregations consisting of many individuals. They may clump because adults are attracted to particular environmental stimuli and/or of an innate tendency to join conspecific individuals. Aggregation behaviour was studied in Coccinella septempunctata L., which forms small clumps, and Ceratomegilla undecimnotata (Schneider) and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze), which form large clumps. Adults were recorded at five hilltop hibernacula (400–1500 m altitude) in central Europe (50–51°N, 14–16°E) for periods up to 27 years. The hibernacula occur in areas sparsely covered with isolated grass tussocks or completely with stones. Numbers of adults recorded under each of 300–900 stones or among the stems of the grass tussocks were counted every year at each hibernaculum. The degree of aggregation was determined using Taylor’s power law. The coccinellid distributions became more aggregated and the size of the aggregations increased as their abundance increased, less in C. septempunctata than in the other two species. Aggregations formed even in the absence of prominent structures, which may attract immigrants, and even when unoccupied stones or tussocks suitable for overwintering were available. Aggregations may be established and their size limited by the strength of the intrinsic preference to join conspecifics. The supposed advantage of aggregated overwintering must be greater than the risk associated with the easy spread of diseases.

N2  - The influence of olfactory and visual stimuli on the mating behaviour of Theresimima ampellophaga males was investigated in the field. A female model attached to a pheromone source significantly increased the number of males contacting and showing copulatory responses compared to their reaction to a pheromone stimulus alone. The pheromone stimulus was the primary factor releasing male copulatory behaviour, independent of the spatial arrangement of olfactory and visual cues. The role of the visual cues decreased with increasing distance between visual and olfactory cues. The reaction of males to pairs of models with different characteristics of conspecific females, in combination with a pheromone source placed 2 cm upwind from the center of the line between each pair of models, was compared. The size and shape of the female seemed not to be important, while the colour, posture, sex and species belongings significantly influenced the male’s mating reaction.

N2  - The present scanning electron microscopy study describes the development of Lecanicillium muscarium, strain DAOM 198499, on the surface of diverse hosts, including Sphaerotheca fuliginea, a fungal host, and Macrosiphum euphorbiae and Aphidius nigripes, insect hosts. The hosts were sprayed with a conidial suspension of L. muscarium (107 conidia/ml). The specimens used in the SEM investigation were collected at particular periods after spraying and prepared for scanning using standard methods. Germination tubes developed twenty-four hours after applying L. muscarium conidia to each host. Hyphae were attached to the host by a thin mucilaginous matrix. Seventy-two hours after spraying, hyphae of S. fuliginea had collapsed and were encircled by the parasite, and primary sporulation of L. muscarium was observed. On the aphid host, colonization started with adherence of the conidia to the host cuticle, followed by conidial germination and growth of mycelium on the surface of the insect’s integument. After 48 to 72 h, post colonization, the first sporulation was observed on the cuticle, particularly at articulations. The mode of parasitism of A. nigripes by this fungus was similar to that of the aphid. Development of L. muscarium was observed on both mummified aphids (containing the pupae of parasitoids) and adult parasitoids.

N2  - The bush-cricket Saga pedo, one of the largest predatory insects, has a scattered distribution across20 countries in Europe. At the northern boundary of its distribution, this species is most commonly found in Slovakia and Hungary. In Slovakia in 2003–2006, 36 known and potentially favourable localities were visited and at seven this species was recorded for the first time. This species has been found in Slovakia in xerothermic forest steppes and limestone grikes (98% of localities) and on slopes (10–45°) with south-westerly or westerly aspects (90%) at altitudes of 220–585 m a.s.l. (mean 433 m, n = 20 localities). Most individuals (66%) were found in grass-herb layers 10–30 cm high and almost 87% within 10 m of a forest edge (oak, beech and hornbeam being prevalent). The maximum density was 12 nymphs (3rd–5th instar) / 1000 m2 (July 4, 510 m a.s.l.). In a comparison of five present and previous S. pedo localities, 43 species of Orthoptera were found in the present and 37 in previous localities. The mean numbers and relative abundance of species in present S. pedo localities were also significantly higher. S. pedo individuals at the northern boundary of their distribution were expected to be smaller and lighter because of suboptimal ecological conditions there. However, the body size of S. pedo individuals from these areas were similar to the average value for the whole area. Based on analyses of present and former localities and the Orthopteran assemblages around S. pedo, the factors endangering this species, and methods for conserving it and its habitat are discussed.

This paper describes the embryonic development of this insect based on light microscopy. Gall midge embryogenesis lasts, on average, 102 h at 17°C and 144 h at 15°C. Living embryos can be quickly separated into ten stages that are clearly defined by specific morphological markers. The necessity for selecting definite embryonic stages for cryobiological storage is discussed.

The morphology of the first instar larva is strikingly similar to that of Dolichotachina marginella (Wiedemann) and Phylloteles pictipennis Loew, all of which are here documented for the first time. These three generic representatives share several character states, which are probably plesiomorphic relative to the condition observed in other miltogrammine larvae, but the uniquely shaped, slender mouthhook, a cushion- or pad-like lobe behind the maxillary palpus (cheek organ), the antero-ventral segmental prolegs of the first instar larva, and the integumental warts of the third instar larvae, are shared character states not known from any other species of Sarcophagidae. Beludzhia Rohdendorf is therefore placed with Dolichotachina Villeneuve and Phylloteles Loew in the tribe Phyllotelini.

The song of D. santomea resembles that of D. yakuba in lacking a "sine" song, but the interpulse interval (IPI) in the "pulse" song is about 67 ms for the former species and 110 ms for the latter. This is the largest difference in IPI observed between any two sister species in the D. melanogaster subgroup, and may play a role in the strong sexual isolation between these two species.

The larvae developed fastest when fed M. persicae, and slowest on B. tabaci eggs. When fed M. persicae, all larvae successfully developed into adult with a growth index (i.e., percent pupation/larval period in days) of 13.16 and development rate of 0.096. The longevity of starving adults was 4.7 ± 0.2 days. In contrast, when fed B. tabaci eggs, all larvae survived to the second instars, 56.7% of which survived to the third instars, 13.3% to the fourth instars; only 6.7% of larvae survived to the pupal stage and the pupae developed into abnormal adults that died shortly. When fed B. tabaci nymphs, all larvae survived and successfully developed into adults with a growth index of 10.71 and development rate of 0.083. The adult body mass was greater when larvae fed M. persicae, compared to adults eclosing from larvae fed B. tabaci nymphs. On the basis of these findings, the order of suitability of three prey organisms for P. japonica is M. persicae > B. tabaci nymph > B. tabaci egg. This is the first record that P. japonica can complete its development when feeding exclusively on whitefly nymphs.

N2  - Poor synchronisation is considered to be one important reason for the ineffective control of the invasive horse chestnut leafminer by native parasitic Hymenoptera. Parasitoids hibernating in dry horse chestnut leaves break diapause early in spring and presumably leave the vicinity, since no hosts are available when they emerge. As a consequence, the percentage parasitism of the first generation of the leafminer in early summer is low. The experiments presented below were designed to test this hypothesis. Horse chestnut saplings were brought on in a greenhouse and infested artificially with C. ohridella prior to parasitoid emergence in the field. These saplings were then exposed to parasitoid attack under natural conditions to eliminate the synchronisation problem. In addition, the parasitoid complexes of other leafmining hosts, which appear early in the season, were analysed. The results confirm that the most important parasitoids of the horse chestnut leafminer are active early in the season, long before the larvae of the first generation of the host are present. Nevertheless, poor synchronisation with the invasive host did not significantly influence the abundance of the most important parasitoid in the complex, Minotetrastichus frontalis, and consequently had no impact on the parasitism of C. ohridella. Nevertheless, a detailed analysis of the parasitoid community shows that certain species are affected by poor synchronisation, while others are probably limited by ecological parameters, such as a specialisation to foraging in particular strata of vegetation. Several leafmining flies were found early in spring infesting other host plants commonly planted in urban green areas, including species with a parasitoid complex similar to that of C. ohridella. The role of these alternative hosts in the food web associated with the horse chestnut leafminer should be subject to further study.

N2  - Plateumaris constricticollis is a donaciine leaf beetle endemic to Japan, which lives in wetlands and uses Cyperaceae and Poaceae as larval hosts. We analyzed geographic variation in body size and ovipositor dimensions in three subspecies (constricticollis, babai, and toyamensis) in different climatic conditions and on different host plants. In addition, the genetic differentiation among subspecies was assessed using nuclear 28S rRNA gene sequences. The body size of subspecies toyamensis is smaller than that of the other subspecies; mean body size tended to increase towards the northeast. Ovipositor length and width are smaller in subspecies toyamensis than in the other subspecies. Although these dimensions depend on body size, ovipositor length still differed significantly between toyamensis and constricticollis-babai after the effect of body size was removed. Multiple regression analyses revealed that body size and ovipositor size are significantly correlated with the depth of snow, but not temperature or rainfall; sizes were larger in places where the snowfall was greatest. Haplotypes of the 28S rRNA gene sequence were not shared among the subspecies. Subspecies constricticollis and babai each had a unique haplotype, whereas subspecies toyamensis had four haplotypes, indicating differentiation among local populations within toyamensis. The evolution of body and ovipositor size in relation to habitat conditions and host plants is discussed.

N2  - A gut-specific chitinase gene was cloned from the mulberry longicorn beetle, Apriona germari. The A. germari chitinase (AgChi) gene spans 2894 bp and consists of five introns and six exons coding for 390 amino acid residues. AgChi possesses the chitinase family 18 active site signature and three N-glycosylation sites. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA suggests that AgChi is a single copy gene. The AgChi cDNA was expressed as a 46-kDa polypeptide in baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells and the recombinant AgChi showed activity in a chitinase enzyme assay. Treatment of recombinant virus-infected Sf9 cells with tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of N-linked glycosylation, revealed that AgChi is N-glycosylated, but the carbohydrate moieties are not essential for chitinolytic activity. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that AgChi was specifically expressed in the gut; AgChi was expressed in three gut regions, indicating that the gut is the prime site for AgChi synthesis in A. germari larvae.

N2  - The energy budget of xylem-feeding Corymbia rubra (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) larvae was estimated by determining bioenergetic parameters. The values of several of the life history and bioenergetic parameters of this wood-feeding insect are exceptional and associated with specific adaptations to living in and feeding on wood. The energy budget of C. rubra sheds light on the life strategy of a xylem-feeder. Its slow growth (0.012 mg × mg–1 × d–1) is associated with a low consumption rate (0.097 mg × mg–1 × d–1) and the low nutritional value of its food (the assimilation efficiency is 34%). The gross growth and net growth efficiency are 15% and 43%, respectively.

N2  - Studies were conducted investigating the responses of female obliquebanded leafrollers, Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) and redbanded leafrollers, Argyrotaenia velutinana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), to components of their sex pheromone. Electroantennogram (EAG) recordings revealed significant responses from antennae of female moths of both species to the major pheromone component, (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate, at dosages ranging from 2 µg – 2 mg. However, tested individually, the minor pheromone components of the obliquebanded leafroller, (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate and (Z)-11-tetradecenol, elicited little or no antennal response from conspecific females. This result was consistent for redbanded leafroller females, which showed only weak responses to the minor component (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetate at a 2 mg dosage. For both species, species-specific blend ratios of the Z and E isomers of tetradecenyl acetate did not elicit a greater antennal response than the Z isomer alone. Virgin females of each species (2–4 d old) were placed into 1-liter plastic assay chambers with constant throughput of carbon-filtered air passed through 1-liter flasks containing rubber septa loaded with (Z)- and (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetates and (Z)-11-tetradecenol for trials with female obliquebanded leafrollers or with (Z)- and (E)-11-tetradecenyl acetates and dodecyl acetate for trials with female redbanded leafrollers. Exposure to pheromone-permeated air delayed the onset of calling by 1 h and terminated the calling period 1 h earlier for both species compared with solvent-control exposed females. Furthermore, the total proportion of calling females was reduced by half in chambers receiving constant throughput of pheromone-permeated air compared with solvent controls. Exposure to pheromone-permeated air also significantly reduced egg-laying in both species compared with clean-air controls. Furthermore, application of the major pheromone component, (Z)-11-tetradecenyl acetate, at dosages ranging from 2 µg – 2 mg to wax-paper ovipositional substrates, deterred oviposition by females of both species. Our data suggest that application of synthetic sex-attractant pheromones for mating disruption of leafroller species may have deleterious effects on female moth behavior, which may contribute to pest control. Field investigations will need to be conducted to test this hypothesis.

N2  - 1. Flight activity in zygopterans is generally restricted to short-range movements associated with foraging, reproductive activity and escape. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that Calopteryx species, including C. splendens, are relatively sedentary species, with a low tendency for long distance movements.2. Recent observations suggest that C. splendens is expanding its northern range in the UK; in the northeast the species is now well established in Northumberland and, in the northwest, has recently spread into south-west Scotland. The current study aimed to investigate the mobility and dispersal tendency of C. splendens in a well-established breeding population in NE England.3. A mark-release-recapture study was carried out on a population of C. splendens along a section of the River Wharfe, West Yorkshire, UK. 831 adult C. splendens were marked uniquely for individual identification in order to monitor the day-to-day, and overall, distance and direction of movement for each individual. Of these 381 were recaptured at least once.4. The majority of males (85%) and females (88%) moved a distance of 100 m or less and only five of the recaptured individuals (1.3%) moved a minimum distance in excess of 500 m. Although the median distance moved by males was greater than that for females, this was not significant. In addition, there was no significant difference in the number of either males or females moving upstream as opposed to downstream.5. The results are compared with those from other studies on calopterygid movement. Although most individual C. splendens stay within a suggested home range of approximately 300 m, clearly individuals have the potential to cover relatively long distances, and it is these latter movements that play a fundamental role in increasing the range of the species.

N2  - The predation rate of the polyphagous predator Macrolophus pygmaeus (Rambur) when offered two aphid species, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas), was investigated. Equal or unequal numbers of nymphs of each instar of the aphids were offered to the predator alone or together. Aphids were placed on an eggplant leaf, together with a fifth instar nymph of the predator in a plastic Petri dish and kept in growth cabinets at 25°C, 65 ± 5% r.h., and a 16L : 8D photoperiod. The predation rate of M. pygmaeus was always higher on M. persicae than on M. euphorbiae. However, biomass consumption was highest when instars of M. euphorbiae were offered in unequal numbers. The predator showed a strong preference and higher biomass consumption of first and second instar M. persicae. In tests where M. euphorbiae was the prey, preference and biomass consumption were almost always higher for the first instar. Therefore, first and second instar M. persicae and first instar M. euphorbiae provide optimal prey for M. pygmaeus. The implication of the prey preference shown by M. pygmaeus for the biological control of these two aphid species is discussed.

N2  - The performance of the aphid-specific fungal pathogen Pandora neoaphidis was studied in relation to changes in herbivore resources for the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, on different host plant species. Dose-response bioassays were conducted with A. pisum which had been reared on dwarf bean then inoculated with P. neoaphidis and returned to dwarf bean or inoculated and transferred to field bean, pea or lucerne. The smallest estimated median lethal concentration (LC50) was 7.7 conidia mm–2 (95% confidence interval 5.4–11.2) for aphids returned to dwarf bean, with LC50s of 13.0 (9.2–19.1) and 14.6 (10.2–21.5) conidia mm–2 for aphids transferred to field bean or pea, respectively. The LC50 when aphids were transferred to lucerne [2941.0 conidia mm–2 (237.3–2.1x109)] was greater than for the other three plants. In a subsequent experiment, A. pisum were reared on pea as well as dwarf bean for four generations before bioassays. The LC50 was 7.3 conidia mm–2 (4.4–12.4) for aphids reared and incubated on dwarf bean, compared to 13.3 (8.0–23.9) and 15.3 (8.8–29.9) conidia mm–2 when aphids were transferred between dwarf bean and pea, and vice versa, respectively. The LC50 for aphids reared then incubated on pea plants was 27.9 (15.8–57.3) conidia mm–2. Hence, the virulence of P. neoaphidis, measured by LC50, was greatest when A. pisum was reared and maintained on dwarf bean, the plant used for long-term routine culturing of the aphid in our facilities. In conclusion, virulence of P. neoaphidis was greater on plant species to which A. pisum had become adapted during long-term laboratory rearing. Plant resources may affect infection by P. neoaphidis and the fungal entomopathogen will have a greater impact on aphid herbivores which are not suffering physiological stress related to a change in host plant.

N2  - While most theoretical models for the evolution of ageing assume that duration of pre-adult development does not affect the longevity, experimental data are still controversial and inconsistent. Here we examined the short-term and long-term pattern of pre-adult development time and longevity in populations of the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) originating from either oak forest (Quercus petrea), a suitable, or locust-tree forest (Robinia psedoacacia), a poor habitat. Using a full-sib design, we examined the genetic correlations between traits found in larvae reared on oak or locust-tree leaves. We detected only negative and insignificant genetic correlations, except for males from the Robinia population reared on oak leaves where the correlation was negative and significant. Our results also showed that a population living 40 generations in the locust-tree forest exhibited a significantly higher longevity than the Quercus population, whereas a significant difference between these two populations in pre-adult development time does not exist. The results are discussed in relation to the potential effect of stress selection in moulding the longevity of the gypsy moth.

N2  - Eurytoma robusta Mayr (Chalcidoidea) exploits host galls either as a primary or secondary parasitoid, an entomophytophagous inquiline or occasionally even as a predator. We present data on its ecology and impact on gall densities and population trends of the gall fly Urophora cardui (L.) on Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. Habitat preference, host gall selection, clutch size, and high incidence of superparasitism causing empty gall cells show that E. robusta, a generalist with a broad host spectrum, is relatively poorly adapted to parasitising U. cardui. The influence of E. robusta on U. cardui in the Belfort-Sundgau region (1970–2004), in the Upper Rhine Valley (1973–2004) and in north-eastern Bavaria (1977–2004), differed considerably. In the forests of the Upper Rhine Valley and the Belfort-Sundgau region, where U. cardui has relatively stable source-sink populations, E. robusta is present but not the dominant mortality factor of the gall fly. In most areas of north-eastern Bavaria U. cardui occurs in fragmented populations and short lived non-equilibrium metapopulations. In these systems E. robusta became more abundant over the last five years, which resulted in a high incidence of superparasitism, an increase in the number of empty gall cells and reduced gall quality. The greatly increased degree of parasitism and an excess of empty cells resulted recently in the collapse of most local populations of U. cardui in the study area south of Bayreuth (north-eastern Bavaria). Together with earlier records the data presented here suggest that in north-eastern Bavaria E. robusta cause fluctuations in the abundance of U. cardui, which have a periodicity of 5–7 years. A remarkable feature of the oligophagous E. robusta is its high fidelity to formerly abundant U. cardui populations, which, with declining host densities, leads to overexploitation, resulting in a high incidence of superparasitism and high larval mortality. The possible influence of the habitat structure on the effect of E. robusta on the population dynamics of U. cardui is discussed. Our data plus that of other authors suggest that, with regard to U. cardui, E. robusta can develop a temporary local host specialisation.

N2  - We hypothesize that differences in fungal taxonomic groups may exert a direct influence on the composition of mycophagous insect communities, and that the relative importance of taxonomy compared to other fungal traits may change as the mushrooms decay. We conducted a 3-year field survey and analyzed the species composition of mycophagous insect communities using partial canonical correspondence analysis (partial CCA). We collected 2457 mushrooms belonging to 27 genera, and 4616 insects belonging to 16 families emerged from 439 of the mushrooms. For the whole insect community, fungal genera explained 10–19% of the total variance in the family composition of the insect communities of mushrooms at different developmental stages. Only the fungal genus Collybia significantly affected the community composition almost irrespective of developmental stage. In the drosophilid community, which consisted of 844 individuals from 9 species, fungal genera explained 19–34% of the total variance. Some fungal genera, such as Amanita and Collybia, affected the drosophilid community, but not at all developmental stages. The number of fungal genera that significantly affected the insect community composition did not differ among fungal stages both in the whole insect community and in the drosophilid community. Thus, our former hypothesis was supported by the present analysis, whereas the latter was not. However, the percentages of variance explained by fungal genera were rather small. This suggests that the importance of fungal genera is likely to be less significant than that of other selection pressures in determining the species composition of mycophagous insect communities.

N2  - Morphometric variation of individuals in field collected samples of the Hyalopterus pruni complex from various Prunus species and regions of Greece was examined, to determine whether this variation is correlated with the host-trees from which the aphids originated. Morphometric data for 13 parameters of aphids from 74 field samples (760 adult apterae) were analysed by canonical variates analysis (CVA). Each sample was collected from a different tree and consisted of individuals from 2–3 neighbouring leaves from the same branch. Each field sample was used as a grouping factor in the CVA. The analysis produced three clusters corresponding to the taxa indicated by previous studies using allozyme markers (i.e., Hyalopterus pruni on apricot, blackthorn, plum and cherry, H. amygdali A on almond and H. amygdali B on peach). The separation was independent on the geographical origin of the samples. However, host associations within the complex were not absolute, and in particular the samples from apricot appeared to include both H. pruni and H. amygdali A. In contrast to previous views, the present study showed that the taxa have their own distinct morphology. Lastly, discriminant functions for separating the adult apterae of the taxa are given.

N2  - Cardiocondyla is one of the few ant genera in which winged dispersing males coexist with wingless fighter males, which predominantly mate inside their maternal nests. Male polymorphism is not genetically determined but induced by environmental conditions (e.g., a decrease in temperature). The factors leading to the production of winged males were studied in more detail by exposing colonies of C. obscurior to a specific set of rearing conditions. A "stressful" environmental condition (rearing temperature lowered on average by 5°C) experienced for at least two days, the decrease of temperature by a minimum of 3°C, and the addition of protein-rich food triggered the development of winged males. In contrast, a smaller decrease in temperature, starvation, encounters with workers from other species, and encounters with alien, conspecific winged males did not induce the production of winged males. Colonies differed strongly in their reaction to changing environmental conditions, which might indicate a difference in their threshold sensitivity. The results are discussed and compared with data from other dimorphic insect species.

N2  - Structure and photomechanical changes upon light/dark adaptation in the superposition compound eyes of the highly sexually dimorphic Orygia antiqua were studied by light and electron microscopy. The eyes of the fully winged male differ from those of the wingless, sedentary female in several respects: they are significantly larger, display a more regular ommatidial array, have a wider clearzone and possess a much more substantial tracheal tapetum. However, the eyes of the female exhibit more pronounced photomechanical changes upon light/dark adaptation than those of the male. We believe that for females, on account of their limited mobility, it is necessary that their eyes can cope with widely fluctuating brightnesses, but that visual sensitivity and resolving power are less important to them than to the actively flying males. Although the latter may be attracted to the females by pheromones, males in their diurnal searches will have to visually avoid obstacles and predators. Moreover, because of their ability to fly, males can seek shelters or shaded areas and unlike the sedentary females avoid prolonged exposures to potentially hazardous light levels. This could explain why the eyes of the females exhibit more pronounced photomechanical responses to changes in ambient light levels.

N2  - Insect genital characters are extensively used in species level taxonomy, and their value in species delimitation is great. Based on the lock-and-key hypothesis and that genital differences function as a mechanical isolation system between species, the value of genital characters has been thought to be superior to non-genital characters. Although geographical and other kind of intraspecific variation of genitalia is often assumed very moderate, its real extent is insufficiently investigated. We examined patterns of morphological variation in the male genitalia of the tortricid moth Pammene luedersiana, using geometric morphometric tools including thin-plate spline deformation grids, and found significant variation. This variation is continuous both within and between populations. No systematic shape variation was observed between populations, but genital size showed some geographic variability. The results suggest that genital morphology is not constant and should therefore be used with caution in lepidopteran taxonomy.

Both new taxa exhibit a unique structure of their wing venation pattern. The Namuroningxiidae fam. n. bears a mosaic of characters diagnostic of several "palaeopteran" families throughout Palaeodictyopteroida and Eupalaeoptera. This fact is highly interesting in reference to the Namurian age known for the occurrence of the first winged insects as well as the palaeogeographical position of the locality far from all sites in Laurussia. The preliminary study of entomofauna diversity exhibit frequent occurrence of archaeorthopterid wing fragments (e.g., Sinopteron huangheense) forming up to 40 percent of all insect specimens demonstrate high abundance of this group in the early Late Carboniferous ecosystems.

Yet doubt has been cast on the validity of the two species, with the suggestion that T. lauri is merely a variant of T. ricini. The taxonomic relationship was therefore investigated using morphological and molecular data. One morphological character traditionally used for the separation of these two species, the arrangement of the submarginal papillae, was found to be unreliable but morphological differences between the two species were found in the cephalic setal state, body outline and dorsal pigmentation. However, the differences were subtle and not always reliable. The molecular data, based on the sequence of a fragment of the COI gene, support the hypothesis that T. ricini and T. lauri are distinct valid species.

N2  - The geometrid genus Cleorodes is shown to belong in the tribe Gnophini (sensu lato) and not in Boarmiini as previously assumed. The conclusion is based on an analysis of morphological characters of a number of genera in these tribes. Moreover, the result is unambiguously supported by a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence variation in three nuclear gene regions (segments D1 and D2 of 28S rRNA, and elongation factor 1a) and a mitochondrial gene, cytochrome oxidase-1. The phylogenetic hypothesis is based on a combined sequence data set, which was analysed using direct optimisation.

N2  - The bee family Melittidae (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) includes 14 genera. Most have been reviewed but not the small African genus Capicola. The present work aims to fill this gap. Based on the revision of the type material and 1272 additional specimens, we provide a comprehensive synonymic and annotated catalogue of the 12 Capicola species sensu Michener (1981). Lectotypes are designated for the previously established species Capicola braunsiana (= C. obscura syn. n.), C. cinctiventris, C. femorata, C. flavitarsis and C. rufiventris. Moreover, C. danforthi sp. n., C. flavicara sp. n., C. gessorum sp. n., C. micheneri sp. n., and C. richtersveldensis sp. n., are newly described, as well as the previously unknown female of C. nanula, male of C. nigerrima and male of C. rhodostoma. New synonymies are proposed for C. braunsiana (= C. obscura) and C. flavitarsis (= C. cinctiventris). An original dataset of 20 morphological characters is used for the inference of the 12 species’ phylogenetic relationship. A key to species is provided. In addition, the ranges of the 12 taxa are mapped and discussed. This paper contributes to a global revision of the Melittidae.

N2  - The cerambycid borers Callidiellum rufipenne (Motschulsky) and Semanotus bifasciatus (Motschulsky) infest coniferous logs in Japan, with the latter distributed in the north and at high altitudes, where both species occur sympatrically. Semanotus bifasciatus adults were active at low temperatures and very active after sunset, and less active but never inactive in the daytime, whereas C. rufipenne adults were usually active at high temperatures and almost only in the daytime. At an almost constant temperature, C. rufipenne adults were almost inactive at night, whereas S. bifasciatus adults showed only an obscure decline in activity in the morning. Of a horizontal log, the upper surface tended to be drier and lower surface wetter, and C. rufipenne larvae grew large if they were in the upper part of a log, whereas S. bifasciatus larvae grew large if in the lower part. Thus, the coexistence of these two species can be ascribed to two major segregation factors: adult segregation based on temperature and sunshine, and larval segregation associated with the moisture content of the wood.

N2  - There is a high density of the cicada Cryptotympana facialis (Walker) (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) in urban parks in central Japan during summer. This cicada uses its stylet to pierce holes in the trunks of keyaki trees, Zelkova serrata and then feeds on the exuding xylem sap. Three ant species, Formica japonica Motschulsky, Lasius japonicus Santschi and Crematogaster matsumurai Forel (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) were observed aggregatively feeding on these exudates. In addition, two wasp species, Polistes jokohamae Radoszkowski (Hymenoptera: Vespidae), and Ampulex dissector (Thunberg) (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae) fed on the sap. These ants and wasps can therefore be classified as commensals. Two flower chafers, Protaetia brevitarsis (Lewis) and P. orientalis submarumorea (Burmeister) (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) were also observed displacing cicadas from their feeding sites and feeding on the exuding sap. Thus, these chafers can be classified as both commensals and kleptoparasites.

N2  - An analysis of testicular morphology and spermatogenesis in the Heteroptera species Antiteuchus tripterus (Pentatomidae) revealed that these traits differ from that recorded for other species of the same family. The testes of A. tripterus have only six lobes, while other species of the same family typically have seven lobes, including a compound lobe, i.e., a lobe containing another in its lumen. A study of meiosis and sperm structure in the different lobes of A. tripterus revealed a conventional meiosis in the lobes numbered one to three. In lobe four, however, prophase I spermatocytes exhibit the morphological characteristics of the so called "diffuse" stage and are larger than those in lobes 1–3 in this and the remaining phases of meiosis. Thus, the resulting spermatids are not only larger but also their head is morphologically different. Lobe 5 exhibits characteristics known from other Pentatomidae species such as an uneven distribution of chromatin to the daughter cells, which give rise to cells of different sizes. This lobe forms spermatozoa of different sizes. Lobe 6, contained within lobe 5, differs from it by having larger cells at a stage similar to the so called "diffuse" and spermatid tails with cross divisions, which are not found in other lobes and unreported in the literature.

N2  - Trichogramma dendrolimi, T. ostriniae, T. confusum and T. evanescens are the four most commonly occurring Trichogramma species with overlapping distribution in China. They are the most frequently used egg parasitoids for biological control of lepidopterous crop pests in China. It is difficult to differentiate Trichogramma species because of their small size and lack of differences in morphological characters. Different molecular markers were employed to molecularly characterize and differentiate these species, including direct amplification of the internally transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) of ribosomal DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and species-specific primers. The results showed that direct amplification of ITS2 could not clearly discriminate these species, but they could be differentiated using RFLP pattern obtained with endonucleases EcoRI and HindIII. The banding pattern produced by RAPD is irreproducible so it is not a suitable way to identify Trichogramma species. Finally, the species-specific primers designed based on ITS2 sequences could unequivocally distinguish the four species. The species-specific primer-based protocol proved to be the most convenient and time saving method for the identification of Trichogramma species by creating a unique PCR product, which can be used in surveying natural populations of Trichogramma species. This is the first report of the prompt identification of the four most commonly occurring Trichogramma species in China.

N2  - Using the fluorescent differential display technique, a special band named Bm541 was identified by screening for differentially expressed genes in the resistant silkworm strain Qiufeng, the susceptible strain Huaba35, and the near isogenic line BC6, which carries the resistant gene to Bombyx mori densonucleosis virus (BmDNV). After applying the 5’RACE technique with specially designed primers, a 1148 bp cDNA clone containing a 387 bp open reading frame (ORF) was obtained. This gene was registered in GenBank under the accession number AY860950. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a 73.1% identity to the protein kinase C inhibitor (PKCI) of Drosophila pseudoobscura. In the deduced sequence of BmPKCI, the histidine triad (HIT) motif, which is essential for PKCI function, and the a-helix region, which is conserved among the PKCI family, were present. The data from quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR) suggest that the expression levels of bmpkci in BC6 and Qiufeng both with BmDNV-Z are significantly higher than those in Huaba35, which indicate that BmPKCI plays a role in resistance to BmDNV-Z.

N2  - The responses of females of the water strider, Aquarius paludum, to changes in NaCl concentration were examined in the laboratory. The insects were sampled seasonally in 2002 and 2003 at two reservoirs in Kochi, Japan, connected by a waterway, one at the mouth of the river with high NaCl concentrations (the range in NaCl concentration during a year: 0.1–1.08%) and one 700 m upstream, where the salinity was lower (0.03–0.23%). Sudden increase in NaCl concentration, from 0.45 to 0.9%, after adult strider emergence suppressed reproduction and promoted flight activity, whereas a decrease in salinity did not affect either trait. In the field, A. paludum was univoltine in brackish and multivoltine in freshwater ponds. Thus, the number of breeding periods per year was limited by fluctuations in the NaCl concentration in brackish habitats. Our results suggest that A. paludum can breed in brackish waters when the NaCl concentration is below the limitation for reproduction and growth. Abrupt increases in NaCl concentration caused by seawater surges, such as those following typhoons, can trigger the migration of individuals, which move to areas of lower NaCl concentration and so mix the genes of individuals inhabiting brackish and freshwater bodies.

N2  - Seasonal variations in the supercooling point, survival at low temperatures and sugar content were studied in field-collected codling moth larvae. The supercooling point of field-collected larvae decreased significantly from a mean value of –13.4°C in August 2004 (feeding larvae) to –22.0°C in December 2004 (overwintering larvae). Survival at –20°C/24 h was 0% during early autumn, whereas it increased to approximately 60% during winter. The survival at low temperature was well correlated with the supercooling point. The supercooling point of the diapause destined larvae decreased from –16.9 to –19.7°C between September and October as the larvae left the food source and spun a cocoon. For early-diapause larvae, exposure to 5°C/30 days has an additional effect and decreased the supercooling point from –19.7 to –21.3°C. One-month exposure of overwintering larvae to 5°C led to a mortality of 23% in early diapause larvae, while only 4% of diapause larvae died after acclimation. Overwintering larvae accumulated trehalose during winter. There was approximately a threefold increase in trehalose content between larvae at the onset of diapause (5.1 mg/g fresh weight) and larvae in a fully developed diapause (18.4 mg/g fresh weight) collected in January. Trehalose content was correlated with supercooling capacity, survival at low temperatures and chilling tolerance, suggesting that trehalose may play some role in the development of cold tolerance in this species.

N2  - Insects have provided much of the best evidence to date concerning possible costs and benefits of multiple mating, and here we investigate the benefits of polyandry in the two-spot ladybird, Adalia bipunctata, by attempting to replicate the highly promiscuous mating system in this species. We compared the temporal pattern of reproductive success of females mated multiple times to one male with that of females mated an equal number of times to multiple males, and found transient differences in offspring production and hatch rate over time. Our data suggest that polyandrous females benefit from multiple mating in some circumstances, but the patterns are complex. Following how both the costs and benefits to mating accrue over time will be necessary if we are to fully understand why polyandry evolves.

N2  - We examined oviposition decisions by Hippodamia convergens Guérin in semi-natural arenas in the laboratory. Gravid females were presented individually with an array of four young sorghum plants, Sorghum bicolor, bearing (1) no additional stimulus, (2) an established colony of greenbug, Schizaphis graminum Rondani, (3) residues of conspecific larvae, and (4) greenbugs plus residues of conspecific larvae. Females laid no egg masses on type 3 plants, significantly fewer than expected by chance on type 4 plants, and significantly more on type 1 plants, with type 2 plants receiving expected numbers. Females laid 50% of egg masses on elements of the arena other than the plants, especially the cage screen, suggesting that females sought to distance their eggs farther from larval residues than the spacing of plants in the arena permitted (15 cm). When the experiment was repeated with plants exposed to larvae of Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer, the repellency was weaker. Once again, clean plants were the most preferred and aphids did not increase the acceptability of plants with larval residues. Nevertheless, only 18% of egg masses occurred off the plants and larval residues did not reduce the acceptability of aphid-bearing plants as did conspecific larval residues. Simultaneous choice tests conducted with individual third instars of both species revealed that C. maculata larvae consumed H. convergens eggs as readily as conspecific eggs, but H. convergens larvae preferred conspecific eggs to those of C. maculata. We conclude that H. convergens oviposition decisions are shaped by the risks of both egg cannibalism and predation.

With additional data for the development of the immature stages, life-fecundity tables were constructed and some population parameters calculated. The average total fecundities of N. includens at the above temperatures were 49.2, 97.8, 162.8, 108.5, 87.4 and 31.1 eggs/female, and average longevities 99.5, 84.7, 69.5, 61.1, 49.6 and 30.1 days, respectively.

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different diets on the development and reproduction of Lygus rugulipennis Poppius (Heteroptera: Miridae). Using 2 laboratory generations (F1 and F2) obtained from field-collected L. rugulipennis, the following diets were tested: beans, beans plus Tenebrio molitor (L.) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) pupae, and a commercial artificial diet, which was developed for mass rearing of Lygus hesperus Knight. As oviposition substrates, beans and agar/parafilm rolls were used. Our data show that both the artificial diet and the artificial oviposition substrate were ineffective substitutes for beans for both laboratory generations. Stage-dependent and total survival rates clearly indicated that F1 Lygus bugs survive significantly longer when they are reared on vegetable substrates i.e., beans and beans plus pupae. The differential effects of the diets were more pronounced in the F2 generation, in which the embryonic development was longer for eggs from females reared on the artificial diet than on beans, and in which the second instar nymphs did not survive on the artificial diet. Both the total duration of post-embryonic development and the longevity of F1 males were shorter on the artificial diet than on beans. Female fecundity was affected by diet in terms of total duration of the oviposition period and mean number of eggs laid/female, since these parameters were lower on the artificial substrate, compared with those obtained on the bean substrate. However, the diet did not affect the morphological parameters, as there were no significant variations in weight, width of cephalic capsule, and tibia and hemelytra length. Since L. rugulipennis cannot be reared on the commercially available artificial diet, we discuss the necessity to improve both the artificial diet and oviposition substrate so that this Lygus bug and its specific egg parasitod Anaphes fuscipennis Haliday (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) can be mass reared.

N2  - Ecological studies on the buprestid beetle Capnodis tenebrionis (Linnaeus, 1767) were carried out in the laboratory and the field. In particular, attention focussed on the effects of seven different temperatures at different times during the day on the movement and feeding activity of this beetle. Field experiments in an apricot orchard recorded the flight activity of C. tenebrionis, with particular reference to the effect of temperature and wind. The experiments highlighted the marked response of movement, feeding and flight activity to increase in temperature. The optimal temperature for feeding, movement and flight was 30°C and above with negative effects occurring at 45°C. Flight generally occurred in the middle of the day. Wind had a negative effect on flight activity. Wind speeds in excess of 4 m/s prevented the insect from taking off. The spread of this phytophagous beetle from one orchard to another is unquestionably influenced by the daily activity and flight behaviour of the adult.

N2  - The initially phytophagous caterpillars of Maculinea alcon and M. rebeli complete their development in Myrmica ant colonies as social parasites. Recent genetic studies show no differences at the species level among various populations of each butterfly taxa. Usually M. alcon and M. rebeli are identified by habitat and larval food plants (Gentianaceae) and host ant specificity is also considered to be an important feature. However most of the ecological characteristics overlap at least in some parts of their distributions. The developmental and survival characteristics of caterpillars reared by different Myrmica species were compared in laboratory experiments and in the field. Morphologically indistinguishable M. alcon and M. rebeli, which originated from Polish populations, are very similar in terms of host specificity i.e. larvae survived both with M. scabrinodis and M. sabuleti. However they showed different growth characteristics. The earlier flight period of M. rebeli, which is synchronized with the phenology of Gentiana cruciata, resulted from the quick growth of caterpillars in Myrmica nests in the pre-winter phase, when they gained about half of their final body biomass. After the end of winter they recommenced growth almost immediately. M. alcon larvae entered diapause shortly after adoption by ants and began to increase in weight significantly just one month after the onset of spring, which synchronized their development with that of their larval food plant, G. pneumonanthe. Therefore neither population group is transferable between habitats and should still be regarded, at least, as distinct conservational units.

N2  - We examined whether dispersal was associated with body and wing morphology and individual quality, and whether such an association was sex-specific, in the Glanville fritillary butterfly Melitaea cinxia (L.) in Paldiski on the north coast of Estonia. Body weight, size and shape of both fore- and hindwing, wing aspect ratio and wing loading were used as measures of body and wing morphology. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of wing shape was used as a measure of individual quality. Males and females did not differ in dispersal rates, despite large differences in overall morphology and FA. Females had a significantly higher wing loading and aspect ratio, but a lower FA than males. Females, but not males, that dispersed differed in forewing shape from those that did not disperse. The sex-specifity of the covariation between dispersal and forewing shape is most probably due to wing shape being associated with different life-history traits in both sexes, resulting in different selection pressures on wing shape in each of the sexes.

N2  - Adult body size is the result of important environmental, maternal and/or genetic effects acting on animals during development. Here we investigate how sexual size dimorphism (SSD) develops in seven species of Odonata: Anax imperator, Cordulegaster boltonii, Onychogomphus uncatus, Oxygastra curtisii (Anisoptera), Cercion lindeni, Ischnura graellsii and Platycnemis acutipennis (Zygoptera). SSD of both the last larval and adult stages of the same individuals, which were reared under laboratory conditions, was measured. The aims were to investigate (i) whether SSD develops during the larval stage, (ii) the direction of larval and adult SSD, and (iii) whether the direction of adult SSD can be predicted by the mating system of a given species (e.g. males of territorial species being larger than females and the opposite for non-territorial species). We found that although larval differences in size may be present between the sexes, these are not necessarily shown in the adult stage (they may change or disappear). Also, the mating system was not related to patterns of adult SSD. Differences in SSD in larvae may be caused by differential use of resources via differential niche-utilisation or sex-specific growth patterns. We highlight the fact that sexual selection favouring large male size and fecundity selection, which selects for large females may be acting on the observed patterns in SSD in adults.

N2  - In the highly sexual-dimorphic nocturnal moth, Acentria ephemerella Denis & Schiffermüller 1775, the aquatic and wingless female possesses a refracting superposition eye, whose gross structural organization agrees with that of the fully-winged male. The possession of an extensive corneal nipple array, a wide clear-zone in combination with a voluminous rhabdom and a reflecting tracheal sheath are proof that the eyes of both sexes are adapted to function in a dimly lit environment. However, the ommatidium of the male eye has statistically significantly longer dioptric structures (i.e., crystalline cones) and light-perceiving elements (i.e., rhabdoms), as well as a much wider clear-zone than the female. Photomechanical changes upon light/dark adaptation in both male and female eyes result in screening pigment translocations that reduce or dilate ommatidial apertures, but because of the larger number of smaller facets of the male eye in combination with the structural differences of dioptric apparatus and retina (see above) the male eye would enjoy superior absolute visual sensitivity under dim conditions and a greater resolving power and ability to detect movement during the day. The arrangement of the microvilli in the rhabdom of both genders suggests that their eyes are polarization-sensitive, an ability they would share with many aquatic insects that have to recognize water surfaces. Although sexual recognition in A. ephemerella is thought to chiefly rely on pheromones, vision must still be important for both sexes, even if the females are wingless and never leave their watery habitat. Females swim actively under water and like their male counterparts, which fly above the surface of the water, they would have to see and avoid obstacles as well as potential predators. This, together with a small incidence of winged females, we believe, could be the reason why the eyes of female A. ephemerella are less regressed than those of other sexually dimorphic moths, like for instance Orgyia antiqua. Another, but difficult to test, possibility is that male and female A. ephemerella have diverged in their behaviour and habitat preferences less long ago than other sexually dimorphic moths.

N2  - Myzocallis (Lineomyzocallis) walshii (Monell), a North American aphid species associated with Quercus rubra was detected for the first time in Europe in 1988 (France), and subsequently in several other countries – Switzerland, Spain, Andorra, Italy, Belgium and Germany. Recent research in 2003–2005 recorded this aphid occurring throughout the Czech Republic. The only host plant was Quercus rubra. The highest aphid populations occurred in old parks and road line groves in urban areas, whereas the populations in forests were low. The seasonal occurrence of the light spring form and the darker summer form of M. (Lineomyzocallis) walshii as well as their different population peaks were noted. Four native parasitoids species [Praon flavinode (Haliday), Trioxys curvicaudus Mackauer, T. pallidus Haliday and T. tenuicaudus (Starý)] were reared from M. (Lineomyzocallis) walshii.

N2  - Exposed Riverine Sediments (ERS) are often characterised by a high diversity of microhabitats due to strong lateral gradients in temperature, humidity, inundation frequency and availability of aquatic food resources and to variations in the degree of vegetation cover, sediment size and sorting. This variation, potentially in combination with interspecific competitive interactions, is thought to drive the microspatial distribution of ERS invertebrates. This research investigated the microspatial distribution of six ERS specialist beetles across three discreet patches of ERS. In particular it examined the temporal stability of species distributions, and their spatial association with environmental variability and other species. The research used a grid of 204 modified dry pitfall traps over six sampling periods in which weather conditions and water levels were stable, and used the Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) method to test the significance of spatial distributions and associations. Strong and significant microspatial zonation was observed for all species, and with few exceptions these distributions were remarkably stable across the study period. This zonation was mainly associated with elevation and proximity to the water, and several species were consistently spatially associated or disassociated with one another. This suggests that laterally more extensive patches of ERS support more species. Operations that reduce the size of ERS patches, such as channelisation, aggregate extraction and regulation are therefore likely to reduce ERS invertebrate diversity.

N2  - Variation with altitude in the composition of dung beetle assemblages and species richness was measured by sampling in spring, summer and autumn, both manually and with pitfall traps at twelve localities in the western Rhodopes Mountains. Non-parametric estimates indicate that most of the regional species pool was collected, some 73% of all taxa previously recorded in the entire region. The rate of species richness decrease with altitude is around 11 species per km, with an evident altitudinal change in the incidence of two main dung beetle functional groups in which Aphodiinae species begin to dominate Rhodopes assemblages at around 1400–1500 m. Species richness of dung pats is dominated by Scarabaeinae in spite of the fact that the number of Aphodiinae species is highest at each locality. Thus, Aphodiinae species are the main contributors to both local and regional pool richness and to species turnover between localities. These characteristics are similar to those observed in the assemblages from another European mountain range, also located near the Mediterranean-Eurosiberian boundary, the Iberian Central System. These results suggest that eastern European dung beetle assemblages are similar in compositional turnover and species richness variation with altitude to that observed in western Europe and North America.

N2  - The aim of this paper is to examine whether current and/or Pleistocene geography affect the species richness and composition of Tuscan archipelago butterflies. This archipelago is located between Tuscany (Italy) and Corsica (France). Faunistic data was obtained from the literature and surveys. Our data revealed that contemporary geography is the most important factor determining the species richness and faunal composition of Tuscan archipelago butterflies. Indeed, current area and isolation of the islands are the only predictors significantly correlated with species richness. Paleogeographic features of the archipelago are not significantly correlated with species richness. Multidimensional scaling revealed patterns similar to those reported for other living groups. Specifically, Capraia and Montecristo group together with Corsica, while Elba, Giglio, Pianosa, Gorgona, Giannutri and the fossil island of Monte Argentario group with the Tuscan mainland. Recent geography seems to affect the faunal composition. Indeed Mantel test indicates that the similarity in the faunal composition of the Tuscan Archipelago islands is mainly related to present-day island characteristics and their relative distance from Tuscany and Corsica. Our results are similar to those recently obtained for Aegean archipelago butterflies.

N2  - We collected specimens of Paramecops sinaitus (Pic, 1930) (Curculionidae: Molytinae) from south Sinai in Egypt, which enabled us to make the first complete description of this species. We also include some taxonomic remarks on the genus. Paramecops solenostemmatis (Peyerimhoff, 1930) is a synonym of Paramecops sinaitus. We propose the new combination Paramecops sogdianus (Nasreddinov, 1978), based on Perihylobius sogdianus Nasreddinov, 1978, which would make Perihylobius and Paramecops synonymous. Like other Paramecops species, P. sinaitus appears to share a close interaction with Asclepiads, in this case the Sinai milkweed Asclepias sinaica (Boiss.) Muschl., 1912 (Asclepiadaceae). We investigated the oviposition behaviour of female weevils to test whether it is linked to larval performance, as predicted by coevolutionary theory. We found that female oviposition preference was positively related to plant size and to the volume of the seed follicles in which the eggs were laid. The survival of eggs was negatively related to plant size, perhaps due to plant differences in the production of defensive cardenolides. Larval survival was not related to plant size but increased with follicle volume, probably as a result of competition for food. Paramecops is relatively sedentary and nocturnal in its behaviour. Night-time observations of behaviour showed that weevils were more active at lower temperatures.

N2  - A cladistic analysis of the species of Sericania Motschulsky, 1860, was executed using fifty-six morphological characters of adults. The monophyly of the genus is supported by the phylogenetic trees generated. Among the three major lineages indicated by the strict consensus tree the East Asian Sericania fuscolineata lineage represents the genus Sericania as defined "originally" and adopted by subsequent authors. The second, the clade Sericania nepalensis group + Sericania sp. 2, is a sister group to the S. fuscolineata clade. Both constitute a sister group to the third major lineage, the Sericania kashmirensis clade, which is endemic in the drier North-West Himalaya where it is the most diverse monophyletic group of Sericini. Provided that the stem species of the S. kashmirensis clade was xerophilous, the origin of this clade can not predate the early Miocene. Based on paleoclimatical and geological data, two competing hypotheses are proposed to explain the evolution of the xerophilous Sericania lineage: (a) a basal splitting within Sericania occurred because of the altitudinal and climatic barrier posed by the Himalaya, which separated the xerophilous lineage in the north (Tibet) from the hygrophilous lineage in the south-east (S slope of Himalaya/ Tibet), or (b) it was a consequence of the increase in the climatic east-west contrast along the southern slope of the Himalaya, which strengthened with the onset of monsoons 8 Ma ago.

Descriptions are provided for nine new species: M. antonioi sp. n., M. arundanus sp. n., M. cabanerensis sp. n., M. crypticus sp. n., M. hurkmansi sp. n., M. legionensis sp. n., M. longispinus sp. n., M. luteihumerus sp. n. and M. quercetorum sp. n. The taxon M. escorialensis Strobl, 1909 is redescribed and lectotype is designated. Lectotypes are designated for four taxa: M. albifrons Meigen, 1822; M. spinipes obscuritarsis Strobl in Czerny & Strobl, 1909; M. spicatus Becker, 1907; and M. spinipes grossus Gil Collado, 1930. Three varieties are redefined and considered as valid species: M. obscuritarsis Strobl in Czerny & Strobl, 1909 (as var. of spinipes); M. grossus Gil Collado, 1930 (as var. of spinipes); M. unicolor Strobl in Czerny & Strobl, 1909 (as var. of aeneus). The following new synonymies are proposed: M. affinis Gil Collado, 1930 syn.n. (= junior synonym of M. longicornis Sack, 1913); M. lusitanicus Hurkmans, 1993 syn.n. (= junior synonym of M. serrulatus Wiedemann in Meigen, 1822); M. andalusiacus Paramonov, 1929 syn.n., M. bolivari Gil Collado, 1930 syn.n., M. hispanicus Sack, 1931 syn.n. (= all three are junior synonyms of M. unguicornis Strobl in Czerny & Strobl, 1909); M. spicatus Becker, 1907 syn.n.

(= junior synonym of M. obscuritarsis Strobl, 1909); and M. spinipes grossus (Gil Collado, 1930) syn.n. (= junior synonym of M. albifrons Meigen, 1822). Status of M. serrulatus Wiedemann in Meigen, 1822 is revised. Four species: M. longicornis Sack, 1913, M. pumilus Macquart, 1849, M. ottomanus Hurkmans, 1993 and M. segetum (Fabricius, 1794) are new for the Iberian Peninsula.

N2  - Dolichopodidae (over 6000 described species in more than 200 genera) is one of the most speciose families of Diptera. Males of many dolichopodid species, including Dolichopus, feature conspicuous ornaments (Male Secondary Sexual Characters) that are used during courtship. Next to these MSSCs, every identification key to Dolichopus primarily uses colour characters (postocular bristles; femora) of unknown phylogenetic relevance. The phylogeny of Dolichopodidae has rarely been investigated, especially at the species level, and molecular data were hardly ever involved. We inferred phylogenetic relationships among 45 species (57 samples) of the subfamily Dolichopodinae on the basis of 32 morphological and 1415 nucleotide characters (810 for COI, 605 for Cyt-b). The monophyly of Dolichopus and Gymnopternus as well as the separate systematic position of Ethiromyia chalybea were supported in all analyses, confirming recent findings by other authors based purely on morphology. Within Dolichopus, stable species groups could be assigned to four distinct categories on the basis of their statistical support in 7 phylogenetic analyses: (i) clades significantly supported in all analyses, (ii) clades supported in trees based on DNA and combined data, but only partly in morphological trees, (iii) clades significantly supported in trees based on DNA and combined data, but not in morphological trees, and (iv) clades consistently supported only in morphological trees. The phylogeny generated here provides a better understanding of the phylogenetic relevance of some debated morphological characters used for species and species-group characterizations in the most commonly used identification keys. In this respect, postocular bristle colour proved of little phylogenetic relevance since every group with species featuring black bristles also included species with partly yellow bristles. Entirely or partly infuscated femora explained the nodes of three stable species groups and even revealed an incorrect polarity of this morphological character in three species. Four of 6 complex MSSCs and 5 of 8 more common MSSCs were found consistently in further species groups.

Both the surface and internal structures of the "plissée” were studied. Light microscopy revealed several patterns in mites studied with Masson’s triple stain and these results were supported by TEM. Although the "plissée” looks similar at the body surface, the structure and ultrastructure differ among groups. Some types of wrinkling is supported by small muscles, probably for changing body shape. Differences in the structure of the cuticle of the prosoma and opisthosoma were observed. The differences in the wrinkling in the cuticle in diferent lines is associated with change in the body shape in response to different moisture conditions.

N2  - The rose aphid, Macrosiphum rosae, living on rose var. Black Magic, was reared in the laboratory at four constant temperatures 15, 18, 22 and 25 ± 1°C, 75 ± 5% R.H. and 14L : 10D. Parameters investigated included developmental rate, survival, pre-reproductive delay and fecundity. The rate of nymphal development (0.17) was greatest at 22°C. The longest developmental time (12.33 days) was recorded at 15°C. The generation time was longest and shortest at 15°C and 22°C respectively. The lower developmental threshold was calculated to be 9.05°C. Based on this, the degree-day requirement from birth to adulthood was found to be 77.5 dd. The pre-reproductive delay also decreased markedly with increase in temperature from 15°C to 22°C. The longest lifespan of apterous females (12.38 d) was observed at 15°C, whereas the shortest (8.06 d) was at 25°C. The mean adult longevity declined with increase in temperature from 15°C to 25°C. The fecundity of females (progeny/female) increased from 11.38 to 28.88 with increase in temperature from 15°C to 22°C but then decreased to 8.38 as the temperature increased from 22°C to 25°C. The largest (0.311) and smallest (0.113) rm occurred at 22°C and 15°C respectively. All of the parameters of the M. rosae life cycle at the four temperatures tested were optimum at 22°C. This Iranian population of M. rosae can develop at lower temperatures than an Australian population.

In water they breathe via a ventral air sheath held by hydrofuge pubescence. The beetles are facultative predators and hunt mosquito larvae, which they grab with their forelegs. The trend to facultative predation in Cucujoidea and the transition for beetles in general from semi-liquid decaying organic matter into water is discussed.

N2  - Small GTPases of the Rab family are key regulators of membrane trafficking. Monoclonal antibodies are useful tools for identifying proteins that interact with other proteins and for examining their tissue distribution. We selected a monoclonal antibody against Rab8 of Bombyx mori L. It specifically recognized amino acid residues 30–109, which are conserved among Rab8 proteins, and did not recognize any other Rab proteins. Western blotting using the antibody revealed one band in the brains of B. mori and rat. Far-Western blotting analysis detected three proteins interacting with Rab8. These results indicate that this antibody is useful for clarifying the physiological function of Rab8 of B. mori and other species. This is a report of a study on a monoclonal antibody against insect Rab protein.

N2  - Wild type silkworm larvae have opaque white skin, whereas the mutants Sel (Sepialumazine) and Xan (Xanthous) are yellow-skinned. Previous genetic analysis indicated that Sel and Xan are on established linkage groups 24 (0.0) and 27 (0.0), respectively. However, in constructing a molecular linkage map using simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci, we found that the two mutations were linked. To confirm this finding, we developed a set of SSR markers and used them to score reciprocal backcross populations. Taking advantage of the lack of crossing-over in female silkworms, we found that the progeny of backcrosses between F1 females and males of the parental strains (BC1F) of the two visible mutations had the same inheritance patterns linked to the same SSR markers. This indicated that the two visible mutations belonged to the same chromosome. To confirm this finding, we tested for independent assortment by crossing Sel and Xan marker strains with each other to obtain F1 and F2 populations. Absence of the expected wild type class among 5000 F2 progeny indicated that the two visible mutations were located on the same linkage group. We carried out recombination analysis for each mutation by scoring 190 progeny of backcrosses between F1 males and parental females (BC1M) and constructed a linkage map for each strain. The results indicated that the Sel gene was 12 cM from SSR marker S2404, and the Xan gene was 7.03 cM from SSR marker S2407. To construct a combined SSR map and to avoid having to discriminate the two similar dominant mutations in heterozygotes, we carried out recombination analysis by scoring recessive wild type segregants of F2 populations for each mutation. The results showed that the Sel and Xan genes were 13 cM and 13.7 cM from the S2404 marker, respectively, consistent with the possibility that they are alleles of the same locus, which we provisionally assigned to SSR linkage group 24. We also used the F2 recessive populations to construct two linkage groups for the Sel and Xan genes.

N2  - The New World grasshopper Cornops aquaticum (Leptysminae: Acrididae) shows a geographical pattern for three Robertsonian polymorphisms in its southernmost area of distribution in Argentina and Uruguay. The frequency and distribution of chiasmata were analysed in five Argentinian populations. This study reveals a strong redistribution of chiasmata in fusion carriers, with a reduction in proximal and increase of distal chiasma frequency in fusion bivalents and trivalents, when all three karyotypes were compared. However, when only fusion bivalents and trivalents were compared, chiasma frequency was significantly higher in the former than in the latter. This higher chiasma frequency in fusion bivalents is due to an increase in proximal chiasma frequency. It is argued that the reduction in proximal chiasma frequency (relative to unfused bivalents) in fusion bivalents may be due to interference across the centromere. Proximal chiasma reduction in trivalents may be attributed either to a physical effect of structural heterozygosity or to an adaptation to the polymorphic condition. Therefore the differences in the distribution of chiasmata in trivalents and Robertsonian bivalents have different causes.

N2  - The bug family Nabidae (Heteroptera) includes taxa showing either a low chromosome number 2n = 16 + XY or high chromosome numbers 2n = 26 or 32 + XY. In order to reveal the direction of karyotype evolution in the family, a molecular phylogeny of the family was created to reveal the taxon closest to the ancestral type and hence the ancestral karyotype. The phylogeny was based on a partial sequence of the 18S rDNA gene of both high and low chromosome number species belonging to the subfamilies Prostemmatinae and Nabinae. Phylogeny created by the Neighbour Joining method separated the subfamilies, Prostemmatinae and Nabinae, which form sister groups at the base of this phylogenetic tree, as well as within the Nabinae, tribes Nabini and Arachnocorini. Combining karyosystematic data with the phylogeny of the family indicated that the ancestral karyotype was a high chromosome number, consisting of 2n = 32 + XY. During the course of evolution changes have occurred both in meiotic behaviour of the sex chromosomes and in the number of autosomes. The direction of karyotype evolution was from a high to low autosome number. Abrupt decreases in the number of autosomes have occurred twice; firstly when the tribe Arachnocorini differentiated from the main stem in the subfamily Nabinae and secondly within the tribe Nabini, when within the genus Nabis 2n = 16 + XY species diverged from the 2n = 32 + XY species. A scheme of the sequence of events in karyotype evolution during the evolution of the Nabidae is presented.

N2  - Overlapping measurements in the length of the genitalia of Leptidea sinapis/reali collected in Slovenia triggered an investigation of a possible natural hybridization between these two well known sibling species of butterflies. Random polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used to generate species specific markers and sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit one gene for determination of the progeny. RAPD’s clustering and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) phylogeny were congruent with the taxonomic placement of specimens of both species, but slightly incongruent with the results of the analysis of genital morphology. Two specimens with L. reali genitalia measurements, but genetically belonging to L. sinapis, had species specific RAPD markers of both species indicating probable hybrid origin. All the specimens with genitalia of intermediate length were also genetically assigned to L. sinapis indicating a possible one way introgression as predicted from their genitalia morphology. Leptidea sinapis was found predominantly in xerothermic habitats in Slovenia, whereas L. reali was more of a generalist except in the sub-Mediterranean region where it is limited to humid meadows.

N2  - Partial (600 bp) sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene were used to infer the phylogeography of Melitaea cinxia (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae) across the entire distributional range of the species, encompassing north Africa and Eurasia. Cladistic analysis of 49 distinct haplotypes (haplotype and nucleotide diversity were 0.95 and 0.027, respectively) revealed strong phylogeographic structure in M. cinxia, characterised by four major clades: Morocco; Western (Iberia, France, Italy); Central (central and northern Western Europe, Balkans, Greece, Anatolia, Levant); and Eastern (eastern Baltic, Urals, Iran, Siberia, China); separated by average pairwise distances of beween 2 and 6 percent. This pattern is consistent with the location of southern glacial refugia in the Iberian, Italian and Balkan peninsulas, as well as multiple eastern refugia. The Western clade is further structured into south-central Iberian, northern Iberian (and French) and southern Italian sub-clades; and the Eastern clade into Near Eastern and Far Eastern sub-clades; with weaker phylogeographical concordance within the Central clade, except for a large area in central and northern Western Europe which is monomorphic for COI haplotype. The Baltic and eastern Europe have been primarily colonized by the Far Eastern sub-clade, rather than the Central (Balkan) clade, highlighting the importance of including Near and Far Eastern populations in phylogeographic studies of Palearctic species. Maps showing the extent of clades and sub-clades suggest several regions of secondary contact and possible hybridization. Interspecific comparison of representative M. cinxia haplotypes supports a monophyletic origin of all M. cinxia.

N2  - In the present study we tested whether the walking activity of macropterous females of the flightless wing-polymorphic bug Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.) can be stimulated by its native adipokinetic hormone Peram-CAH-II and the crustacean red pigment-concentrating hormone (Panbo-RPCH), and the effectiveness of the latter hormone in a lipid mobilization assay. Two different doses (10 or 40 pmol) of Peram-CAH-II or Panbo-RCPH were injected into 10-day-old macropterous females of P. apterus to evaluate their effects on the walking activity of treated females. The results obtained showed a significant stimulation of walking activity only with the lower dose (10 pmol) of either hormone Peram-CAH-II or Panbo-RPCH. On the contrary, the walking activity of the same-aged females of macropterous morph treated with the higher dose (40 pmol) of these hormones was decreased. The energy substrates mobilized in Panbo-RPCH-treated macropterous females were lipids. The question of whether the stimulation of locomotion by Panbo-RPCH is limited only to P. apterus or if it might also represent an important function of this hormone in other insects or even in crustaceans is discussed.

N2  - The brassica leaf beetle, Phaedon brassicae Baly (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), one of the pests infesting cruciferous vegetables in China and Japan, is a multivoltine species that oversummers and overwinters as an adult. The effects of both temperature and photoperiod on reproductive diapause induction were systematically investigated in this beetle. Under 16L : 8D, most of the beetles entered reproductive diapause at 12–30°C, indicating that photoperiod played a crucial role in estivation diapause induction. Under 12L : 12D, all adults developed without diapause at 28 and 30°C; less than 25% of the individuals entered reproductive diapause at 16–24°C; however, 46.1% of the individuals entered diapause at 12°C, suggesting that low temperature also had a relatively important influence on the determination of diapause. The photoperiodic response curves indicate that this species is a typical short-day species. The critical day-lengths at 20, 24 and 28°C were 13.2, 13.6 and 13.8 h, respectively. Transferring them from 16L : 8D to 12L : 12D or vice versa at different ages and/or stages during their development revealed that the photoperiod experienced by adults during the first 11 days might be important for diapause determination, even though an effect of photoperiod on the larval and pupal stages can not be excluded. Transferring individuals kept at a photoperiod of 12L : 12D from 25°C to 12°C or vice versa at different ages and/or stages during their development revealed that the temperature cue for diapause is mainly perceived by the late instar larvae and pupae.

N2  - The diapause inducement condition, cold hardiness, and flight ability in Cry1Ac-resistant (BtR) and Cry1Ac-susceptible (96S) strains of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) were compared in the laboratory. The BtR strain was derived from the 96S strain and shows 1375-fold resistance to the Cry1Ac toxin after having been selected for 52 generations. Compared with the 96S strain, the Bt-resistant strain was more likely to go into diapause under a short-photoperiod environment. At 11L : 13D, 12L : 12D and 13L : 11D photoperiods, the percentages of BtR insects entering diapause were 72.7%, 82.9% and 68.7%, respectively, which were significantly higher than those in the 96S strain (58.6%, 67.4% and 46.3%, respectively) under the same conditions. The supercooling points (SCP) and freezing points (FP) were not significantly different between the BtR and 96S strains. The LT50 (50% lethal time) and LT90 (90% lethal time) of BtR pupae were also not significantly different from those of the 96S strain at –15°C. The moths from both strains had similar flight ability when their larvae were fed with nontoxic control diet. However, the total flight distance of these BtR moths was 56.2 km whose larvae fed on normal diet, which was more than twice as much as for those feeding on Bt diet (26.2 km). Flight duration for these BtR moths was longer after feeding on normal diet (11.6 h) than after feeding on Bt diet (7.3 h).

N2  - The effect of photoperiod on parasitization of the eggs of the Angoumois grain moth, Sitotroga cerealella (Olivier, 1789) by Trichogramma principium Sugonyaev & Sorokina, 1976 was investigated under several photoperiodic regimes of L : D = 3 : 21, 6:18, 9 : 15, 12 : 12, 15 : 9, 18 : 6 and 21 : 3. In all regimes, certain wasps delayed ovipositing in this non-preferred host. Potential fecundity of T. principium females (the number of mature ovarial eggs at emergence) and subsequent oogenesis (estimated by the number of mature ovarial eggs in non-ovipositing females) was independent of photoperiod. However, the percentage of females that oviposited was higher for females that developed and were kept under 6–12 h long photophase than for those that developed and were kept under ultra short (3L : 21D) and under long (18L : 6D and 21L : 3D) photophases. The average duration of the pre-oviposition (egg retention) period showed the opposite pattern to the photoperiodic response. A possible explanation of this reaction is that the delay in oviposition is adaptive if the probability of finding a better host is high. In autumn, when the last Trichogramma females are still active but their lepidopteran hosts are already much less abundant, then parasitization of any suitable host is the best strategy.

N2  - The zoophytophagous mirid bug Macrolophus caliginosus is an important biocontrol agent of whiteflies in the Mediterranean region. Periods of low productivity in commercial breeding units and unsuccessful establishment in greenhouses prompted this study of mating behaviour. Here we describe copulation behaviour, the diel mating periodicity and post-copulatory refractory period. A natural plant substrate needs to be provided if one wants to observe the copulatory behaviour of M. caliginosus in the laboratory. There was no apparent directional orientation in the approach of the two sexes, instead males pursued females after "accidentally" contacting them. Males mounted females from above, very rapidly, and without any obvious courtship behaviour, and copulation duration was very consistent (286.33 ± 4.23 s, mean ± SE). Observations over a 24-h period showed that mating was most frequent in the 8-h scotophase and first half of the 16-h photophase than in the second half of the photophase. Mated females became strongly unreceptive to new male mounting attempts, shaking their abdomen and leaving the plant if harassed. To determine the duration of the post-mating refractory period mating receptivity of females that had mated 1 or 2 weeks earlier was compared with that of virgin females of similar age. Mated females remained unreceptive even 2 weeks after mating, whereas half of the virgin females of equivalent age mated. Mated females were more likely to abandon a plant than virgin females when harassed by a male. Most males remated a few minutes after mating for the first time. M. caliginosus is atypical among mirids in that females apparently mate only once.

N2  - The availability and quality of nectar for adults are thought to affect fecundity of the cotton bollworm, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Experiments were conducted to analyze the effect of adult feeding on the fecundity, and oviposition pattern of moths, and larval performance (egg hatch). The moths were fed either on distilled water, honey solution, or one of a range of concentrations of sucrose solution. The results showed that diets with sugars significantly increased fecundity and adult lifespan. Lifespan, total numbers of eggs and egg mass were significantly higher for females that fed on sugar during adult life. Egg hatch (a measure of offspring fitness) decreased over time regardless of sucrose concentration, but had always higher levels in the groups fed sugars. The peak of the ovipositing period was delayed and prolonged, with more eggs deposited, when moths were fed on sugar solution. In conclusion, adult feeding increases the fecundity of female moths and plays an important role in enhancing the fitness of individual cotton bollworm offspring.

N2  - The number of sperm a male ejaculates is influenced, among other factors, by male age, time since last copulation and possibly a combination of both. Males of Chorthippus parallelus erythropus were subjected to three successive matings in which males had a remating interval of either one or three days. The first ejaculate was very variable. It contained a mean of 433,000 sperm. If there was a one-day interval between matings, the second and third ejaculate comprised 16–19% of the number of sperm in the first ejaculate, respectively. Its sister taxon, the subspecies Chorthippus p. parallelus showed a similar second ejaculate size but the third ejaculate further declined to 8–10% compared to the first. If there were three days between matings, second and third ejaculates comprised 148.3% and 63.1% of the number of sperm in the first ejaculate in Chorthippus p. erythropus. This was markedly different to two individuals of Chorthippus p. parallelus where second and third ejaculates comprised 597% and 416% of the first. It is speculated that this indicates an overall higher sperm production because testis size was also larger in Chorthippus p. parallelus than Chorthippus p. erythropus. The results also show that theoretical models on sperm allocation may underestimate the rate and age-dependency of sperm replenishment.

N2  - The Scarce Large Blue (Maculinea teleius) is an endangered butterfly throughout Europe due to its special life-cycle and habitat loss. Our aims were to describe the microhabitats available to this butterfly, to test what factors influence the presence and density of M. teleius adults and to investigate the relationship between host ant species and M. teleius. The vicinities of eight fens were sampled, where there are four types of microhabitats available for this butterfly: Narrowleaf Cattail (Typha angustifolia), Purple Loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria), Marsh Woundwort (Stachys palustris) and Purple Moorgrass (Molinia coerulea) dominated vegetation. In five transects (50 × 5 m) around each fen (running from the edge of the fen into the meadows) the number of imagos was counted twice a day during the flight period. Along the transects, the following parameters were measured or assessed: number of flowerheads of foodplant (Sanguisorba officinalis), microhabitat type, grazing intensity, soil humidity, vegetation height and host ant presence. The four microhabitat types differed significantly in soil humidity, vegetation height, foodplant density and distance from a fen. Generally the Typha microhabitat, situated closest to fens, had the highest soil humidity and vegetation height, followed by the Lythrum, Stachys and finally the Molinia microhabitat along a gradient decreasing soil humidity and vegetation height. The foodplant was most abundant in the Lythrum and Stachys microhabitats. Using linear mixed models and forward stepwise manual selection we found that microhabitat type was the most important factor determining the presence of M. teleius. The local grazing intensity had no direct effect but flowerheads of the foodplant had a positive effect on the abundance of butterflies. The number of butterflies was significantly higher in quadrats where the host ant (Myrmica scabrinodis) was present compared to those where they were absent. Our results suggest that grazing should be continued in order to maintain the current distribution of microhabitats and survival of the butterflies.

N2  - The multicolored Asian ladybeetle, Harmonia axyridis (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), was first reported in southern Canada in 1994. In this study, we examined the status of the ladybeetle in Quebec agroecosystems seven to ten years after its arrival. We integrated the findings from eight independent field studies carried out in pome fruit, grapes, medicinal crops, field corn, sweet corn, sweet pepper, lettuce, and soybean. Nine aphidophagous and 6 coccidophagous coccinellid species were sampled on these crops. Among these aphidophagous species, three invasive (H. axyridis, Coccinella septempunctata and Propylea quatuordecimpunctata) as well as one indigenous species (Coleomegilla maculata lengi) were consistently present. Higher richness was observed in perennial crops, where the 6 coccidophagous coccinellids were almost exclusively present. Higher abundance of aphidophagous coccinellids was observed in field and sweet corn. The multicolored Asian ladybeetle was a dominant species of the coccinellid assemblage in all crops monitored.

N2  - While the study of colour patterns is a traditional subject of evolutionary ecology, there are various hypotheses which suffer from a lack of experimental evidence. One intriguing possibility is a trade-off between warning efficiency and detectability. After a certain size threshold, the detrimental effect of increased detectability can outweigh the benefits of warning colouration. One may thus expect corresponding patterns at the level of ontogenetic development: as juveniles grow, they should first acquire warning colouration, and then lose it again. We analysed this possibility in Orgyia antiqua, a moth species with hairy larvae which are polyphenic with respect to the intensity of warning colouration. We detected a regular change in colour patterns through larval life. Indeed, the larvae tend to display warning colouration at intermediate sizes while dull colours dominate in fully grown larvae. In aviary experiments, we confirmed that the colourful phenotype is the one that causes the strongest aversion in birds. Nevertheless, the effect was rather weak and most of the larvae were still eventually consumed when found. Unexpectedly, for human subjects, the warningly coloured larvae were harder, and not easier to find among natural vegetation, most likely due to the disruptive effect of the aposematic colour pattern. Importantly, the trend was reversed in the largest size class, suggesting that the disruptive colouration loses its advantage as the larva grows. This is consistent with the actual patterns of size-dependence of colouration. We present evidence against an alternative explanation which relates size-related change in colouration to behavioural changes prior to pupation. We conclude that even if the efficiency of the warning effect plays a role in determining the size-dependence of colouration, the pattern may be largely explained by the effects of size-dependent detectability alone.

N2  - Studies were conducted to investigate the distribution of larvae of the European vine moth, Lobesia botrana (Denis & Schiffermüller) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), a key vineyard pest of grape cultivars. The data collected were larval densities of the second and third generation of L. botrana on half-vine and entire plants of wine and table cultivars in 2003–2004. No insecticide treatments were applied to plants during the 2-year study. The distribution of L. botrana larvae can be described by a negative binomial. This reveals that the insect aggregates. A common value for the k parameter of the negative binomial distribution of kc = 0.6042, was obtained, using maximum likelihood estimation, and the advantages and cases of use of a common k are discussed. The $k^{-1}Sinh^{-1}(ksqrt{x+1/2})$ and $k^{-1}Sinh^{-1}(ksqrt{x+3/8})$ proved to be the best transformations for L. botrana larval counts. An entire vine is recommended as the sampling unit for research purposes, whereas a half-vine, which is suitable for grape vine cultivation in northern Greece, is recommended for practical purposes. We used these findings to develop a fixed precision sequential sampling plan and a sequential sampling program for classifying the pest status of L. botrana larvae.

N2  - Historical data sources on abundance of organisms are valuable for determining responses of those organisms to climate change and coincidence of changes amongst different organisms. We investigate data on the general abundance of Lepidoptera over an 89 year period 1864–1952. We related abundance to monthly mean temperature and precipitation and the winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, and to numbers of migrants from an independent source. Abundances of Lepidoptera were significantly positively correlated with current year temperatures for May to September and November and significantly negatively correlated with temperatures in January. Numbers were also negatively correlated with rainfall for April and May and annual total of the current year and with August in the previous year. Abundance of Lepidoptera decreased significantly with an increasing winter NAO index. Increased overall abundance in Lepidoptera coincided significantly with increased numbers of migrants. The climate associations were very similar to those previously reported for butterfly data collected by the British Butterfly Monitoring Scheme; although warm and drier summers were generally beneficial to Lepidoptera populations, wet summers and winters and mild winters were not. We discuss the implications for Lepidoptera biology and populations in regions of Britain in the face of projected climate changes.

N2  - Species number – body weight distributions are generally thought to be skewed to the right. While this pattern is well documented in vertebrates, comparative studies on species rich invertebrate taxa are still scarce. Here I show that the weight distributions of central European Coleoptera (based on 8257 species body weight data compiled from Freude et al., 1964–1994) are predominantly right skewed. Skewness and species richness per taxon were positively correlated. The number of modes of the body weight distributions was negatively correlated with species richness. 273 of the 558 genera had bimodal distributions. Species richness per genus did not significantly depend on mean genus body weight. In general the coleopteran size distributions differed from those of European Hymenoptera but were similar to the respective distributions of vertebrates. I conclude that we should be cautious when generalizing patterns found in one taxon.

N2  - The linkage between spermathecal morphology and sperm dynamics was experimentally analysed in Schizocosa malitiosa (Tullgren, 1905) using histological serial sections and SEM. We recognised three connected sections for each spermatheca: basal atrium, stalk and head. The head ends blindly, is sclerotized, provided with few large pores, and surrounded by thick, presumably glandular epithelium. The atrium is also sclerotized, and connects with both copulatory and fertilization ducts, lying close to each other. A porous plate is located in the stalk-atrium connection. Nine adult females were fixed in eight reproductive conditions for reconstructing sperm dynamics: virgin, immediately after mating, one day after mating, three days after mating, one day after remating without oviposition (first male with a single useful palp, second male normal), immediately before oviposition, three days after oviposition, and one day after remating with oviposition (female had eaten first egg-sac and had remated). Our results suggest female control of sperm transport because the penetration of encapsulated sperm into the spermathecal head continues after mating. Stored sperm is maintained in an encapsulated condition until oviposition, when sperm is totally activated. Sperm cells may remain viable for a long time in the decapsulated state. There was evidence for sperm mixing in the female that remated after oviposition.

N2  - Five flightless species of Micromus are known from the Hawaiian Archipelago; only one, the rare Micromus usingeri, is reported from the Island of Hawai‘i. Herein, we report the natural occurrence of intermediates between this brachypterous species and its near relative, the macropterous Micromus longispinosus. We compare some morphological and life-history characteristics of the two species and the intermediates. Our study shows that: (1) The two closely related species are broadly distributed on Hawai‘i, but they appear to be allopatric altitudinally. (2) M. usingeri is associated with a cool, misty, high-altitude environment, M. longispinosus with warmer, rainy conditions at lower elevations. The intermediates occur in both types of situations and generally at intermediate elevations. (3) The macropterous M. longispinosus has large, oblong, flexible, membranous forewings and hind wings. In contrast, the brachypterous M. usingeri has convex, shortened, elytra-like forewings with reticulate venation, and very small, thick, triangular, stub-like hind wings with greatly reduced venation. The wings of intermediate specimens exhibit a broad range of variation between the two species. (4) Several characteristics of wing venation are highly correlated with reduced wing size; others are not. (5) Aside from the wings, adults of M. usingeri and M. longispinosus differ in relatively few morphological features, most notably the antennal and metatibial length, prothoracic length, mesothoracic length and width, and the length of the spine-covered process on the posteroventral margin of the male T9+ectoproct. The intermediate specimens are variable in adult characteristics, but they generally fall between the two species. (6) Egg size and larval characteristics (except the body length of the fully-fed first and third instars) do not differ between the two species. (7) The evolution of the wing variation is discussed.

N2  - Factors were examined that could be responsible for the predominance of Coccinella septempunctata (C7) in most habitats of the Palaearctic and for its successful invasion of the Nearctic Region. C7 is euryphagous, but less polyphagous than Harmonia axyridis or Coleomegilla maculata in that it cannot develop or reproduce on non-aphid food. The intraguild status of C7 is intermediate. Although adult size is large, preimaginal stages are palatable to those of H. axyridis and Adalia bipunctata, whereas it is not an intraguild predator of these species. Although these traits appear to be neutral or negative, many aspects of population plasticity are advantageous for C7, often acting in concert with a bet-hedging strategy. Given its high mobility and eurytopy, the inhibition of oviposition in the presence of conspecific larval trails represents an adaptive advantage that favors increased egg dispersal and lowers the risk of offspring mortality due to cannibalism. The ability to temporarily suspend oviposition, combined with heterogenous voltinism and diapause tendencies, enable a portion of C7 populations to feed and reproduce on unpredictably occurring aphid populations. An absence of reproductive diapause in males and pre-hibernation mating are other significant adaptations, along with the tendency to produce offspring in excess of the carrying capacity of local food resources. We suggest that one explanation for the broad geographic success of C7 resides in an ecological plasticity that is based on both genetic and phenotypic polymorphisms.

N2  - In the Noctuidae, the owlet moths, the internal genitalia, i.e. the aedeagus and vesica (penis) in the males, and the bursa copulatrix in the females, together form a lock-and-key mechanism (LKM). The species-specific structures have their counterparts in the opposite sex. The internal LKM constitutes a specific reproductive isolation mechanism (lock-and-key hypothesis), which seem to be the rule in the ditrysian Lepidoptera, and also occurs in the Carabidae (Coleoptera) and some other insects. In contrast, the external genitalia rarely have species-specific counterparts in the sexes. Several results indicate the presence of LKMs: In the Noctuidae, (1) heterospecific differences in the male vesica may prevent sperm transfer or lead to mechanical failure during copulation, (2) the more complicated the specific genitalia structures, the more aberrations may occur even in conspecific copulations, and (3) in many species pairs and groups, and in one large genus, Apamea, the structures in the opposite sexes show a strictly specific correspondence, but, (4) when there is precopulatory isolation due to differences in pheromone production or perception, the internal genitalia may be identical. Conversely, in the Colias butterflies (Pieridae), (5) frequent heterospecific hybridization is associated with the similarity of the internal genitalia. The LKMs seem to protect genomes against alien genes, supposedly selected for because of the lower fitness of specimens with an imprecise LKM and/or inferiority of hybrids. In the literature, the diversity of the noctuid genitalia has been ascribed to sexual selection, because the females were classified as polyandrous. Most species produce the main part of their eggs monandrously, and remate, if at all, in their old age, and are thus successively monandrous and polyandrous. The allopatric divergence in the structure of the internal genitalia of 39 Holarctic pairs of sister species of Noctuidae is suggested to be due to genetic drift. The insecure function of the female pheromones and external genitalia of males are illustrated with the aid of original photographs.

Moreover, a conclusive identification and localization of all the ribosomal clusters is provided by using heterologous rDNA FISH on spermatocyte chromosomes. 18S–28S rDNA mapped on a single chromosome pair and resulted multiclustered along the chromosomal body in three distinct serial regions, r1, r2 and r3. Surprisingly, these areas were scarcely (r1) or never (r2 and r3) detectable by silver impregnation. As in other Orthoptera and many groups of arthropods, FISH with the pentamer (TTAGG)n as the probe labelled the telomeres of all chromosomes.

This identification is important for bee breeding and preserving honeybee biodiversity. To investigate the origin of Jordanian honeybees, 32 samples collected from different locations in Jordan were analyzed using four different enzyme systems: Bg/II site in cytochrome oxidase b (Cytb), EcoRI site in large ribosomal (lsRNA) subunit, XbaI site in cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) subunit and HinCII site in cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) subunit. The first three enzymes were found to be polymorphic. The DNA banding pattern analyses revealed that Jordanian honeybees belong to the East Mediterranean and Middle Eastern mitochondrial lineages.

N2  - Experimental hybridization of X0 and XY chromosome races of the brachypterous grasshopper P. sapporensis did not reveal pre-zygotic reproductive isolation. However, a partial zygotic barrier was found between the X0-standard race from Shimokawa and XY-standard chromosome race from Akan. Approximately 40% of embryos from females crossed with males from other chromosome races developed parthenogenetically, the remaining embryos were normal heterozygotes. Adult F1 males and females from crosses of this type had properly developed testes and ovaries. Non-sister associations and other irregularities in meiosis were not observed in male meiosis. Crossing experiments demonstrated that hybrids between X0 and XY races occur to some extent. The absence of a hybrid zone between the X0 and XY chromosome races may be the result of selection against heterozygotes. Crosses between the XY-Tanno and X0-standard (Teine) subraces resulted in F1 and F2 generations in spite of the many chromosome differences between them such as a X-A translocation and fixed pericentric inversions in four pairs of autosomes. These results do not support the hypothesis that chromosomal differences play a key role in restricting gene flow between the X0 and XY races of P. sapporensis.

A karyotype of 25 chromosome pairs, with median centromeres (FN = 100), was found in all the species of Talitridae analysed and Apohyale prevostii. Genome size (C-value) varies among Talitrida from 0.94 pg in Apohyale crassipes to 2.81 pg in Orchestia gammarellus, and the percentage of AT-DNA in the whole genome ranges from 56.12% in A. crassipes to 68.17% in Sardorchestia pelecaniformis. In comparison with Hyalidae, Talitridae show more uniformity in chromosome number and karyotype formula, and have larger genomes. There is a direct correlation between total DNA content and the amount of C-heterochromatic DNA. The cytogenetical data on Talitrida were compared from a phylogenetic and an evolutional point of view. The increase in genome size during the evolution of the Talitrida possibly had a role in their adaptation to supralittoral life and extreme subaerial conditions.

N2  - C. aquaticum (Acrididae: Leptysminae) inhabits water-hyacinths in the Neotropical region. The blue-flowered water-hyacinth, Eichhornia crassipes, has been introduced elsewhere without its natural enemies and has become a weed; recently C. aquaticum was considered as a possible biological control agent. In this work, six populations were sampled and cytologically studied. C. aquaticum has 2n = 23 chromosomes in males and 24 in females, with an X0/XX sex determination system. All chromosomes are acro-telocentric and the basic karyotype includes three Robertsonian (Rb) translocations between pairs 1/6, 2/5, and 3/4. These polymorphisms are restricted to the lower course of the Paraná river, between Rosario and Buenos Aires. Fusion frequencies increase southwards, thus showing a geographical cline. The polymorphisms mostly accord with Hardy-Weinberg and gametic phase equilibria. The rearrangements cause a drastic chiasma repatterning in the fusion bivalents (or trivalents) which reduces the proximal chiasma frequency. Recombination is also reduced due to the loss of independent segregation. A recombination index that takes into account both these factors correlates negatively with the number of pairs of chromosomes affected by fusions among populations, which does not accord with the "central-marginal" pattern.

Previous studies on the heterochromatin content and distribution in Heteroptera (insects with holokinetic chromosomes) have shown that the species belonging to the family Coreidae are interesting model organisms since they show very diverse C bands patterns. In the present work, we analyzed the C-band pattern in individuals of Holhymenia rubiginosa from different populations collected in different years. This species has the diploid karyotype 2n = 27/28 = 24 + 2m + X0/XX (male/female). C-bands are terminally, subterminally or interstitially located on 10–17 chromosomes and a remarkable heterochromatin heteromorphism is observed in the meiotic bivalents: in the presence/absence of bands, in the size of bands and number of bands. A heteromorphism is also inferred in the number of ribosomal genes from the difference in the fluorescent in situ hybridization signals between NOR-homologues. Chiasmata are generally located opposite to conspicuous C-bands, but in some bivalents chiasmata are also observed in close proximity to C-bands. Considering the striking variation in heterochromatin content between individuals and populations it is suggested that heterochromatin should be selectively neutral in H. rubiginosa.

N2  - We sequenced nine introns of 25 silkworm (Bombyx mori L.) strains, assuming that the introns are particularly prone to mutation. Mean sequence divergence and maximum sequence divergence in each intronic sequence among 25 silkworm strains ranged from 0.81% (3.8 nucleotides) ~ 9.15% (85.2 nucleotides) and 1.2% (seven nucleotides) ~ 39.3% (366 nucleotides), respectively. The degree of sequence divergence in some introns is very variable, suggesting the potential of using intronic sequences for strain identification. In particular, some introns were highly promising and convenient strain markers due to the presence of a large indels (e.g., 403 bp and 329 bp) in only a limited number of strains. Phylogenetic analysis using the individual or the nine concatenated intronic sequences showed no clustering on the basis of known strain characteristics. This may further indicate the potential of the intronic sequences for the identification of silkworm strains.

N2  - In many insect species with a pupa covered by various "shells” (puparium, host remains, etc.) pupal-adult ecdysis and emergence to the open air represent two discrete steps. However, in Trichogramma, as well as in other insect parasitoids, these two processes have never been studied separately. We investigated the temporal pattern of pupal-adult ecdysis and of adult emergence from the host chorion in Trichogramma embryophagum Hartig (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) in laboratory conditions (12L : 12D, 20°C). Adult ecdysis was arrhythmic, while adult emergence showed a strong rhythmicity. The time lag between ecdysis and emergence varied from one to almost two days, depending on the circadian time of the ecdysis. The proportion of ecdysed adults that stayed in the host chorion ranged up to 60% (just before the highest peak of emergence). The cumulative percentage of ecdysed adults gradually increased with time, independently of whether the light was turned on in accordance with the entrained circadian rhythm or 4 h earlier. This arrhythmic ecdysis could be explained by the fact that the ecdysed adults get into a well protected space inside the host chorion and the timing of this event is adaptively neutral.

N2  - Flight is important for insects but also incurs costs in terms of reduced reproductive reserves. Recent studies on butterflies have shown that thorax mass and nitrogen content decrease over the adult lifespan, suggesting that flight muscle breakdown may also occur in butterflies. However, unlike other insects known to resorb flight muscles, butterflies will continue to fly throughout the reproductive period. Nonetheless, use of nutrients from flight muscles for reproduction has the potential to improve the reproductive output considerably. In this study we have tested to what extent female Pieris napi L. (Pieridae) butterflies actually do breakdown flight muscles. By comparing muscle mass in recently emerged and older free-flying females we show that mass and nitrogen content of the two most important groups of flight muscles each decrease by more than 50% over the adult lifespan. The significance of this finding is discussed in relation to reproduction and flight in butterflies.

N2  - The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that short-winged (brachypterous) and long-winged (macropterous) adult males of a flightless bug Pyrrhocoris apterus differ in fertilization success. For this purpose, 5, 10 and 28 days old brachypterous and macropterous males were mated for the same period of time with reproductively active 5 days old brachypterous females. The average hatchability of five egg batches of these females was used as a measure of the fertilization success of the males. The results revealed significantly higher hatchability of the eggs laid by females that copulated with 5 or 10 days old brachypterous males than with same-aged macropterous males. In contrast, the average hatchability of eggs of females that copulated with 28 days old brachypterous males was significantly lower than of those mated with same-aged macropterous males. It is the first report of wing morph- and age-related differences in fertilization success of males in insects with a non-functional wing-polymorphism. The possible relationship between wing- and age-related differential fertilization and the mating success of P. apterus males, and differences in the amount of secretion transferred from their accessory glands into the reproductive tract of females during copulation, is discussed.

N2  - Trophic eggs, which are not viable and eaten by larvae, are produced by the passalid beetle Cylindrocaulus patalis. This is the first record of trophic eggs in subsocial Coleoptera. There are differences in the morphology of trophic and fertile eggs; the former are a paler colour and softer than the latter. The surface of the chorion of trophic eggs is also smoother than that of fertile eggs. The trophic eggs are fed directly by the female parent to 3rd instar larvae following a series of specific behavioural interactions between them, including repeated stridulation by the larva. It is likely that trophic eggs supplement the protein-poor diet of the larvae and contribute to their growth and survival. The production of trophic eggs may be associated with the evolution of an extremely small clutch size in C. patalis.

N2  - One of the most compelling challenges for conservation biologists is the preservation of species with restricted ranges. Carabus olympiae Sella, 1855, a ground beetle species inhabiting two small areas in the western Italian Alps, is an example of a steno-endemic and endangered insect species. Despite the fact that this species is historically well known to professional and amateur entomologists, its autecology is virtually unknown. In the present study we used pitfall traps to study habitat selection and phenology, and radiotelemetry to measure differences in movement parameters between sexes, habitats and periods. Data from pitfall trapping suggested that C. olympiae actively selects both shrubberies (alpen rose Rhododendron ferrugineum and bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus) and beech forests and avoids pastures, and that population size peaks in July. All radio-tagged individuals (n = 21) moved without a preferred direction, and were more active at night than by day. Males covered greater distances and had more tortuous trajectories than females. Distances covered in forests and alpen rose shrubberies were not significantly different, but paths in beech forests were more convoluted than in shrubberies. The movement pattern observed fits the requirements of a typical "olfactory-tactile" insect predator that looks for prey by systematically exploring its territory. Movement parameters suggested that both beech forests and alpen rose shrubberies are suitable for this species and indicated that the spatial distribution of shrubs in shrubberies can constrain trajectories. The implications for conservation are: (i) any human intervention which results in enlargement of the present coverage of pastures should be controlled; (ii) forest management may be tolerated, with the condition that alpen rose shrubberies remain or develop after tree-cutting; (iii) once a shrubbery has established, it should be preserved through appropriate management.

N2  - Recent host records for Gephyraulus raphanistri (Kieffer), a flower-gall midge, show restriction to Raphanus raphanistrum throughout Europe. Gephyraulus raphanistri has never been reported infesting commercially grown Brassica crops. Historical records showing a broad host range appear to have resulted from confusion with new or as yet undescribed Gephyraulus spp. and Contarinia nasturtii (Kieffer), a known gall-former of Brassica and other related genera. This study tested host specificity of G. raphanistri in the field in Europe by manipulating host plant phenology of actual and potential hosts in the genera Raphanus and Brassica as part of a risk assessment of the insect as a potential biological control agent of R. raphanistrum, one of the most important weeds of crops in Australia. Raphanus raphanistrum raphanistrum (wild radish), R. raphanistrum landra (coastal wild radish), Raphanus sativus (radish) and Brassica napus (oilseed rape cultivar) were phenologically synchronised for initial flowering and planted out in a flowering time and species block design near a natural population of R. r. landra hosting a natural population of G. raphanistri. Three generation peaks in gall formation were observed in the experiment, with galls developing on all test plants with an apparent preference for R. r. landra. The high field specificity of this gall midge is driven by the synchrony of oviposition and flower availability, not host physiological incompatibility or behavioural unacceptability. Commercially grown Brassica spp. are not suitable hosts for G. raphanistri because in the field they differ in flowering phenology from Raphanus raphanistrum. The overlap in the flowering phenology of the crop and weed in Australia makes this insect unsuitable as a biological control agent.

N2  - The current laboratory study was designed to evaluate the effect of abiotic and biotic factors such as temperature, light intensity, relative humidity and host age on biological and ecological characteristics of Aphelinus asychis (Walker) parasitizing Aphis gossypii (Glover). The traits studied were developmental duration, mortality, sex ratio, longevity, fecundity and host feeding. A. asychis can completely develop and reproduce at temperatures 18°C and 30°C, light intensities of 1000 and 7000 lux and relative humidities of 30% and 60%. Temperature had a significant effect on the developmental duration as well as on the percentage and longevity of females, while mortality from mummification to emergence, fecundity and host feeding were only slightly affected. Relative humidity only affected the developmental duration of A. asychis. Light intensity had mostly affected the biological and ecological traits of A. asychis. High light intensity resulted in a shorter developmental duration, higher incidence of females and longer life span of the female parasitoid. A high tolerance to climatic variations and life cycle well adapted to this aphid host are properties that make it likely that A. asychis could be used for the biological control of the cotton aphid in greenhouses.

N2  - Chequered blue butterfly, Scolitantides orion (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) has severely declined in many parts of Europe and is currently red-listed in many countries. We studied the population structure and turnover of the species in a lake-island system in a National Park in eastern Finland over a three-year period. The incidence of the chequered blue on the suitable islands (n = 41) and habitat patches (n = 123) was high: an average of 82% of the islands and patches were occupied over the three year period. At the island scale, the annual population turnover rate was 17%, with an extinction and colonization rate of 7% and 10%, respectively. At the patch scale, the annual population turnover was 16%, with 7% extinction and 9% colonization rate. Islands that were occupied over the three year period had a larger area of suitable habitat than islands in which turnover events were observed. At the patch scale, turnover events were observed in small and poorly connected patches. Patchy occurrence of the host plant and observed extinction-colonization dynamics suggest that the chequered blue population confirms a metapopulation structure. Although the local populations are small, the observed high patch occupancy and balanced population turnover indicates that the metapopulation is not in immediate risk of extinction.

N2  - The activities of three enzymes involved in polyol biosynthesis (aldose reductase, AR; ketose reductase, KR; and polyol dehydrogenase, PDH) were studied in adult females of the linden bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, collected from the field during 2005/2006. While the activities of three enzymes were low in reproductive females, activities greater by one or two orders were seen in reproductively arrested females. AR and KR showed similar seasonal trends in activity. Activities were low during diapause initation and later increased and stabilized during autumnal diapause development. Further increases of AR and KR activities were seen during low temperature quiescence and finally the activities sharply decreased during vernal resumption of direct development. The activity of PDH was relatively high (but fluctuating) during diapause, then decreased in quiescent insects and almost disapeared in reproductively active females. Insects collected in February were subjected to laboratory de-acclimation (exposure to high temperatures) followed by re-acclimation (exposure to low temperatures) which resulted in loss of activity in all three enzymes and no regain. High activities of AR, KR and PDH in reproductively arrested females thus conform well with their previously observed high capacity to synthesize and accumulate polyol cryoprotectants.

N2  - The endemic large carpenter bee, Xylocopa (Koptortosoma) ogasawarensis Matsumura (Hymenoptera: Apidae), on the oceanic Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands, located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, approximately 1000 km south of the Japanese mainland, is a generalist flower visitor. Although the flower-visiting behaviour of X. ogasawarensis females has been frequently recorded, the behaviour of the males in this species has rarely been studied. I observed the territorial behaviour of males on flowers of the native plant species Scaevola sericea Vahl (Campanulales: Goodeniaceae) in a coastal area of Hahajima in early July 2007. Each male chose a particular inflorescence, hovered near it (mean distance, 239 mm from the inflorescence) and patrolled around it for several minutes (mean time, 331 s). Therefore, X. ogasawarensis males exhibit resource-based (i.e., flowers) territoriality. Males frequently attacked other males when defending their territories. However, males did not defend their territories against flower visitors of other species (i.e., introduced honeybees). Therefore, male territorial behaviour in X. ogasawarensis may be related to intrasexual competition for sites visited by females. This is the first report describing the male territorial behaviour of X. ogasawarensis.

Females of the two species were significantly attracted by odours of conspecifics males, and males of N. rugosus, but not of N. pseudoferus, were attracted by odours of conspecific females. Odours of conspecifics of the same gender were unattractive. These results suggest the existence of male pheromones in both species and a different female pheromone in N. rugosus.

N2  - While the key role of termites in the decomposition of litter in the tropics has been acknowledged for a long time, much less information exists on their importance in the recycling of dung of primary consumers, especially herbivores. A review of published studies shows that a diverse group of termites (at least 126 species) has been reported to feed on a wide range of mammalian dung (18 species). Predominantly, wood-feeding and polyphagous wood-litter feeding species were found to feed also frequently on dung. Moreover, we found that termites can quickly remove large amounts of mammalian dung, especially in the dry season, when on average about 1/3 of the dung deposited in a given habitat is removed by termites within one month (with the highest rates observed in savannas). No distinctive preference for mammalian dung over other organic food sources was observed for fungus-growing termites (Macrotermitinae), whereas the majority of the non-fungus growing taxa studied prefer dung over other food. As termites bring large quantities of dung below the soil surface, disturb and enrich soils with nutrients, dung feeding by termites appears to be a previously underestimated process important in the functioning of tropical ecosystems.

N2  - A cytogenetic study of bisexual species belonging to the genera Cirrorhynchus, Dodecastichus and Otiorhynchus is presented in order to confirm their taxonomic position. The karyotype characterization was accomplished by an analysis of mitotic and meiotic chromosomes after differential staining, namely by C-banding, silver impregnation, DAPI and CMA3. A review of the cytogenetic data for the tribe Otiorhynchini contributed to knowledge of chromosomal evolution in this group. An investigation of five of the species studied showed some similarities such as a sex chromosome system of "parachute type” (Xyp), the presence of 10 autosomal bivalents (2n = 22) and heterochromatin localized around centromeres. These observations are similar to those already described for Otiorhynchini species, and confirm the karyological conservatism of this weevil group. In contrast, another species Cirrorhynchus kelecsenyi has an additional four autosomal bivalents (n% = 14 + Xyp, 2n = 30), which differs considerably from the chromosomal homogeneity of the other genera. Karyotypic evolution in this species was achieved most probably by increasing the number of chromosomes by centric fissions, resulting in variation in the number of acrocentric chromosomes. DAPI-positive and CMA3-negative reactions of heterochromatic DNA in all the species studied suggest that it has an AT-rich composition. Impregnating chromosomes with silver nitrate reveals NORs on one pair of autosomes, and probably argentophilic material in the interspace between the X and y sex chromosomes. The karyological findings support the taxonomical revision of Otiorhynchini based on morphological characters.

N2  - The distribution patterns of the X0/XX and neo-XY/neo-XX chromosome races, subraces, and "hybrids” between subraces of the grasshopper P. sapporensis were analyzed. The origin of the observed variation is Robertsonian translocations between a sex chromosome and an autosome, and chromosome rearrangements. The fixation levels of inversions varied depending on geographic regions. No hybrid population is known implying that a strong reproductive isolation system exists in hybrids between the different chromosomal races. The probable reasons for the purity of X0 and neo-XY chromosome races and high chromosome polymorphism in contact zones between chromosomal subraces are discussed. The presence of isolating barriers between chromosome races indicates a review of the taxonomic structure of P. sapporensis is required. It is proposed to divide P. sapporensis into two sibling species, which differ in the chromosome mechanisms of the sex determination system.The analysis of the distribution of chromosomal races and subraces of P. sapporensis allows a reconstruction of the history of this species in the Okhotsk sea region.

Based on phylogeography and taxonomy, Merodon desuturinus is of special interest from a biogeographical and conservation perspective. Characterization and determination of genetic relationships between M. desuturinus and taxa of the M. aureus, M. avidus, and M. ruficornis groups on the Balkan Peninsula were estimated based on molecular markers (allozymes and COI sequences). We observed that the mean number of alleles per allozyme locus was 1.1, frequency of polymorphic loci 0.067, and heterozygotes were absent. Our results showed an extremely low genetic variability in the M. desuturinus population sampled. We suggest that this taxon calls for a conservation management plan, as it is likely a vulnerable and threatened taxon, an endemic, spatially divided species and represents a unique genetic unit on the Balkan Peninsula.

N2  - The meadow spittlebug genus Philaenus (Auchenorrhyncha: Aphrophoridae) is known to display marked colour polymorphism. This study presents the results of a karyotype analysis of P. arslani from Lebanon using conventional chromosome staining, C-banding, fluorescent banding using base-specific fluorochromes (CMA3 and DAPI) and AgNOR-staining. This species has 2n = 18 + neo-XY, and differs from P. spumarius both in the number of chromosomes and sex chromosome system. During meiosis, the neo-XY bivalent is clearly heteromorphic being the largest in the complement. Furthermore, sex chromosomes show marked differences in C-banding pattern. The NOR-bearing chromosomes are the first and one of the middle-sized pairs of autosomes. NORs are G-C rich. Furthermore, some blocks of constitutive heterochromatin on the sex chromosomes are also G-C rich. All other C-bands are DAPI or DAPI/ CMA3 positive, thus containing A-T rich DNA. The significant difference in the karyotype of P. arslani and P. spumarius indicates chromosomal transformations during the evolution of the genus Philaenus.

N2  - The corpora cardiaca (CC) of the pneumorid grasshopper species Bullacris discolor contain at least one substance that causes hyperlipaemia in the migratory locust. Isolation of neuropeptides belonging to the adipokinetic hormone (AKH) family was achieved by single-step reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) of CC extracts and monitoring tryptophan fluorescence. The material of the bladder grasshopper showed three distinct fluorescence peaks with adipokinetic activity in the migratory locust. The peptide sequences were identified by Edman degradation after the N-terminal pyroglutamate residue had been cleaved off enzymatically, and the exact peptide masses were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Moreover, the assigned peptides were synthesised and natural and synthetic peptides were compared in their behaviour in RP-HPLC. B. discolor stores three AKH peptides in its CC: two of those are octapeptides, Schgr-AKH-II (pELNFSTGWamide) and Peram-CAH-II (pELTFTPNWamide), whereas the third peptide is a decapeptide, Phyle-CC (pELTFTPNWGSamide. The concentration of carbohydrates in the haemolymph of B. discolor is about 3 times higher than the lipid concentration. Upon injection with synthetic Schgr-AKH-II no adipokinetic or hypertrehalosaemic effect was measurable. A literature survey appears to indicate that an active role of these AKH peptides in substrate mobilisation is only overtly displayed in those caeliferan species that undertake well-defined flight periods.

N2  - The degree of polyandry in a species is linked to other life history traits such as egg maturation, life span, and male ejaculate size and quality. The study of differences in mating strategies between closely related species can provide a better understanding of the evolution of these strategies and of sperm competition. Mating patterns of two closely related species of small ermine moths (Yponomeuta) were investigated in the laboratory. The average female age at first mating was higher in Y. cagnagellus than in Y. padellus. Both species mated more than once; however, Y. cagnagellus females were more likely to remate in a short time frame. Moreover, Y. cagnagellus had higher life time female mating frequencies than Y. padellus (viz., 3.0 versus 2.0). These differences in mating frequency were confirmed in the field by examining the presence of spermatophores (or their remains) in the bursa as well as sperm in the spermatheca of field-caught females.

N2  - We have studied the effect of different light gradient regimes on host-plant selection of the carrot psyllid, Trioza apicalis Förster. In both a strong and a weak light gradient, carrot psyllids preferred a carrot leaf placed in higher light intensity. When the choice was between the host (carrot Daucus carota L.) and a non-host (barley Hordeum vulgare L.) virgin adults settled significantly more often on non-host in higher light intensity than on carrot in lower light intensity. In a weak light gradient, none of the gravid females settled on a non-host. In an experiment without light gradient, gravid females showed a preference for carrot, whereas virgin females settled approximately equally on Norway spruce Picea abies Karst. (winter shelter plant) and carrot. Our results show that virgin and gravid individuals have different host-plant selection behaviour, and that they are sensitive to small differences in light intensity. Both factors can create a source of variation in behavioural assays, and should be taken into consideration in future experiments with this and probably also related species. Our results suggest that carrot psyllids can utilize visual cues (light intensity or wavelength) in host-plant selection, and the role of visual cues should be more thoroughly studied.

N2  - Interactions between herbivorous insects and their parasitoids occur in highly structured and complex environments. Habitat structure can be an important factor affecting ecological interactions between different trophic levels. In this study the influence of plant architecture and surrounding vegetation structure on the interaction between the tansy leaf beetle, Galeruca tanaceti L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and its egg parasitoid, Oomyzus galerucivorus Hedqvist (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), was investigated at two small spatial scales in the field. It was expected that high and structurally complex plants or vegetation represent an enemy free space for the herbivore by making host search more difficult for the parasitoid. At the scale of individual plants, plant height had a positive influence on herbivore oviposition and egg clutch height a negative impact on parasitism. In addition, the beetle was more likely to oviposit on simple plants than on plants with branches, while the parasitoid remained unaffected by the degree of branching. At the microhabitat scale (r = 0.1 m around an oviposition site), both height and density of the vegetation affected beetle oviposition positively and egg parasitism negatively. The herbivore and its parasitoid, therefore, were influenced in opposite ways by habitat structure at both spatial scales investigated, suggesting the existence of an enemy free space for the herbivores’ eggs on tall plants and in tall and complex vegetation. This study indicates that structural components of the environment are important for interactions among organisms of different trophic levels.

N2  - Leafrollers can experience high levels of indigenous parasitism in organically managed apple orchards and the augmentative release of specific parasitoid species to suppress these secondary pests may be advantageous in orchards converting to non-chemical pest management. Caged and uncaged releases of two ichneumonid [Apophua simplicipes (Cresson) and Glypta variegata Dasch] and two braconid (Macrocentrus linearis Nees and Apanteles polychrosidis Viereck) koinobiont endoparasitoids of the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) on host-infested potted apple trees were conducted to assess the parasitoids’ abilities to find and successfully parasitize sentinel hosts under orchard conditions. Seasonal timing of the trials varied for each parasitoid species, based on their relative performance under simulated summer/fall conditions in laboratory trials. After the release of five or fifty parasitoid females, the mean percent parasitism of leafroller larvae collected from infested trees ranged from 0 to 75% depending on the parasitoid species involved. Although caged releases tended to increase the percentage of live parasitized hosts in release treatments, uncaged releases provided a more realistic assessment of the parasitoid’s ability to seek and find hosts within an infested area over a longer period. Release of the large, solitary A. simplicipes, had the most significant impact on the host population density.

N2  - Viticulture is one of the most intensively managed agricultural ecosystems in Europe. Therefore, the conservation problems of vineyards and the ecological benefits of increasing the amount of fallow land are addressed using butterflies as a model group. We established 43 transects, each 100 m long, in a vineyard region in the vicinity of Trier (Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany) and recorded the butterflies observed along these transects on 20 occasions from late May to early August 2003. Transects crossed vineyards, fallow land and transitional areas of land. 4041 individuals of 34 species showed the typical pattern of relative abundance with few common and many relatively rare species. Fallow land had more individuals and species and a higher Shannon species diversity index than vineyards. Community evenness and average butterfly dispersal ability were highest in the vineyards. Principal Factor Analyses and UPGMA cluster analysis distinguished between fallow land and vineyards. The difference between early meadow and late forest fallow land areas was not strong, but the former tended to have a higher diversity than the latter. Vineyards thus might act as a sink for butterflies. Therefore, a clear separation between vineyards and fallow land is best for nature conservation. As young fallow land tends to have a higher diversity than older fallow land in this study, it is likely that the conservation value of vineyards for butterflies could be increased by active management of fallow land areas.

N2  - Roadside verges in densely populated areas are often a significant addition to the total semi-natural area and as such may contribute to the conservation of biodiversity. Furthermore, they can enhance the ecological cohesion of a region, especially when the existing nature reserves are small and/or highly fragmented. We investigated the occurrence of ground beetles and spiders in six highway verges with grey hair-grass vegetation in the Veluwe region, The Netherlands. Total species number in the verges was similar to the values found in nearby nature reserves with comparable vegetation, but the ground beetles tended to be more abundant in the reserves. Many stenotopic species were present in the verges, confirming the significant conservation value of this habitat. However, compared with the nature reserves, there were fewer species of stenotopic ground beetles and the stenotopic spiders were less abundant in the verges. From our knowledge of the biology and ecology of the species captured it seems likely that this is attributable to differences in "habitat quality". In the verges, species preferring bare sand are scarcer, and the weighted mean body length of ground beetles is shorter than in nature reserves. This suggests that the sward in the road verges is too dense and the suitable vegetation too patchy to sustain some of the stenotopic species. Habitat analyses support this contention: Compared with the nature reserves, the verges had proportionally less bare sand, more herb and tree cover and the vegetation patches were smaller. The strategy suggested to promote stenotopic species entails removing encroaching trees and shrubs from the verges in order to expand the nutrient-poor zone and (re-)create pioneer conditions. Subsequent management should aim at further improving the road verges as extensions of nutrient-poor habitat.

N2  - The mouthparts of the spoon-winged lacewing Nemoptera sinuata are adapted for the uptake of pollen and nectar. Form and function of the mouthparts are described, and the technique of food uptake is discussed in context with flower-visiting behaviour and floral architecture of the preferred flowers. The maxillae are the main organs for food uptake. The brush-shaped laciniae, galeae and maxillary palpi form a functional unit which can be extended by the action of the cardo-stipes joint. Video analyses of the mouthpart movements distinguished different patterns of maxillary motions which occur in nectar feeding or pollen collecting. The flower-visiting behaviour and the specialised mouthparts of the Nemopteridae are derived traits which probably evolved from predatory and biting/chewing mouthparts within the Neuroptera.

N2  - Cuticular parts of the spermatheca and associated vaginal structures (chiefly the ring sclerites of the parietovaginal glands) have been examined and compared in 190 cydnid species representing 65 genera and all five subfamilies currently recognized in the family (Amnestinae, Cephalocteinae, Cydninae, Garsauriinae, Sehirinae). Four species belonging to genera formerly included within the Cydnidae (Dismegistus, Parastrachia, Thaumastella, Thyreocoris) were also examined. Morphology of the three main parts of the spermatheca [seminal receptacle (distal bulb), intermediate part (pump apparatus), spermathecal duct] is described. Four main types of spermathecae can be recognized from the distal receptacle and the intermediate part: the amaurocorine type (in Sehirinae: Amaurocorini), amnestine type (in Amnestinae), garsauriine type (in Garsauriinae), and "cydnoid" type (in Cephalocteinae + Cydninae: Cydnini, Geotomini + Sehirinae: Sehirini). No synapomorphy of these types was found which suggests that the currently conceived Cydnidae are not monophyletic. Moreover, out of these four types only the "cydnoid" is typically pentatomoidean due to the presence of an intermediate part usually well delimited by two flanges and having always an unsclerotized flexible zone as well as two internal cuticular structures (septum and fretum) partly obstructing the lumen. The simple tubular amaurocorine type is unusual and aberrant within all Pentatomoidea. The amnestine and garsauriine types display some similarities with taxa outside the Pentatomoidea, especially with some lygaeoid or coreoid spermathecae, mainly in the structure of the intermediate part not delimited proximally (absence of flanges) and devoid of the flexible zone. Within the "cydnoid" type, six spermathecal facies can be characterized principally according to the shape of both the apical reservoir along with the intermediate part, and the differentiations of the spermathecal duct. It has been impossible to find any synapomorphy for all species and for the six facies belonging to the "cydnoid" type of spermatheca. We suggest that the Cydnidae as defined presently are probably a polyphyletic group; moreover its main "cydnoid" branch, called by us Cydnidae sensu stricto (Cephalocteinae + Cydninae + Sehirinae: Sehirini) seems to be relatively recent among the Pentatomoidea. Nishadana and Nishocoris are transferred from Garsauriinae back to Cydninae: Cydnini and the tribe Amaurocorini (Sehirinae) is upgraded to a separate subfamily Amaurocorinae stat. nov. Moreover, we regard the Geotomini and the

Six new species are described, illustrated and keyed: Discheramocephalus brucei sp. n. (Cameroon), D. elisabethae sp. n. (Cameroon), D. mikaeli sp. n. (Tanzania), D. stewarti sp. n. (Bolivia), D. jarmilae sp. n. (Bolivia), D. minutissimus sp. n. (Indonesia). Adults of D. minutissimus have a body length of about 400–426 µm, which is at the lower limit among non-egg-parasitoid insects. Evidence is provided that an egg size large enough to produce a viable larva is the main factor limiting miniaturisation of female insects. Females and males of egg-parasitoids are able to overcome the 400 µm threshold and reach limits of 180 µm and 130 µm, respectively. Brain size is likely the second most important factor limiting miniaturisation in insects.

N2  - Given the generalist tendencies of most predatory arthropods, it is widely thought that their impact on a particular prey species in a given habitat (e.g., an insect pest in a crop) will depend frequently on the local availability of other prey (which for omnivorous predators, can include plant resources, such as fruit and pollen). Thus, from a slightly different perspective, aphids, other herbivorous insects, and plants often may interact indirectly by sharing natural enemies. Such interactions may be either negative or positive, as in the concepts of apparent competition and apparent mutualism, and may therefore have variable impact on the herbivores’ host plants as well. I examine the different mechanisms for such indirect effects among herbivores as explored in the experimental literature. An impressive collective effort by numerous researchers recently has expanded considerably our empirical base of support for a variety of hypothesized mechanisms; aphids stand out as the most commonly studied subjects in research on these mechanisms. I therefore focus especially on the recent literature of cases involving aphids interacting indirectly with other prey for generalist predators. My remarks are organized by considering how the availability of alternate prey may alter functional and numerical (aggregative and reproductive) responses of predators to focal prey density. Although the distinctions among these different classes of predator responses and the associated indirect effects are often blurred and scale-dependent, this classification remains useful for organizing the diverse ways in which aphids have been found to participate in indirect interactions among prey as mediated by predators. Collectively, the results of the numerous studies reviewed here suggest that many such indirect interactions likely occur frequently in natural settings, with consequences ultimately for host plant performance.

N2  - Aphidophagous ladybirds exhibit a broad range of body sizes. Until now this has been thought to be a function of the different prey densities that they feed at, with smaller ladybirds feeding at lower prey densities. The size of the prey species they feed on has been considered to have no relationship with ladybird body size. However, these arguments possess a limited capacity to explain observed data from the field. I here demonstrate a more realistic, complex approach incorporating both prey density and the size of prey species. Small ladybirds can feed on small aphids at both low and high densities. However when the aphid species is large they cannot catch the older, bigger, more energy-rich aphid instars due to their small size. They are thus unable to feed on large aphid prey at low densities, although at higher densities numbers of the smaller instars may be sufficient to sustain them. By contrast large ladybirds can feed on large aphids at both low and high densities due to their superior ability to catch the bigger, more energy-rich older aphids; however they cannot be sustained by low densities of small aphids due to food limitation consequent on their large size. This more complex association between ladybird size, prey size and prey density possesses a better explanatory power for earlier field data. Because of this relationship, ladybird body size also provides an important trade-off determining dietary breadth and specialization in the aphidophagous Coccinellidae. Dietary specialists more closely match the size of their limited prey species, have higher overall capture efficiencies and can thus continue to reproduce at lower aphid densities for longer. By contrast dietary generalists adopt a one-size-fits-all strategy, are medium-sized and have lower capture efficiencies of individual prey species, thus requiring higher aphid densities. The role of body-size in dietary specialization is supported by data from the British fauna. Rather than trade-offs related to prey chemistry, which have hitherto been the centre of attention, body size trade-offs are the likely most important universal factor underlying dietary specialization in aphidophagous coccinellids.

N2  - The role of predators and parasitoids in the regulation of insect populations is widely reported in the context of both pest and non-pest insects. However, this is not the case for pathogens (entomopathogens). Indeed, most studies on insect life history refer only to predators and parasitoids when considering natural enemy guilds, even though naturally occurring entomopathogens are undoubtedly more diverse and widespread. This is certainly the case with the Coccinellidae; the natural enemies of coccinellids have been the subject of a number of review articles but pathogens receive only brief mention. In this review we attempt to address the balance and consider the interactions of natural populations of Coccinellidae with entomopathogenic fungi. Most research on entomopathogens and Coccinellidae focuses on the non-target impact of biorational insecticides against coccinellids and the impact of fungal infections upon aggregations of overwintering coccinellids; with the former overwhelmingly dominating the literature. Given the prominence of coccinellids in classical and conservation biological control, it is surprising that studies have not measured the natural impact of pathogenic fungi upon introduced species or natural populations of Coccinellidae, as has been done with numerous insect pest species. Here we review the literature on the intriguing interactions between coccinellids and fungal pathogens. We examine the literature on direct infection (sub-lethal and lethal) of coccinellids by pathogenic (Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus) or parasitic (Hesperomyces virescens). We also consider the role of intra-guild predation (on the aphid-specific fungus Pandora neoaphidis and Beauveria bassiana) and finally indirect interactions such as coccinellids dispersing P. neoaphidis. We suggest that fungal pathogens are all too often forgotten natural enemies and future research should address the profound absence of knowledge in this field.

N2  - A laboratory experiment was conducted to determine whether the predation strategy of larvae of the aphidophagous silver fly Leucopis annulipes Zetterstedt (Diptera: Chamaemyiidae) is furtive, as are larvae of the aphidophagous midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza Rondani (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), or active like aphidophagous ladybird beetle larvae (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). The impact of L. annulipes larvae on pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), colony disturbance was evaluated and compared with that of the furtive predator A. aphidimyza and the active-searching ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis Pallas. Results indicate that aphids showed significantly fewer defensive acts (dropping, walking away, wriggling) in the presence of L. annulipes larvae than of ladybird beetle larvae. Furthermore, the impact of L. annulipes larvae on aphid colony disturbance was similar to that of A. aphidimyza and to a control treatment without predators. These results clearly indicate that L. annulipes larvae use a furtive predation strategy.

N2  - This article studies coccinellid dispersal in heterogeneous environments using some hypotheses on dispersal rates that correspond to empirical observations. It is assumed that emigration rates increase with decreasing patch payoff that is measured either as the number of aphids per a lady beetle, or as the number of aphids only. Three scenarios for immigration are considered: individuals choose patches unconditionally, immigration is proportional to patch quality, and immigration is proportional to patch payoff. Coccinellid spatial distributions corresponding to these assumptions are given by a power law. Using some data from the literature on distribution of Coccinella septempunctata it is shown that the model with emigration proportional to the ratio of the number of conspecifics to aphid density and unconditional immigration rates provides the best fit when compared with the other models. This model predicts undermatching where better patches get lower consumer density when compared with the ideal free dis

N2  - In agro-ecosystems, habitat loss and fragmentation may alter the assemblage of aphidophagous insects, such as foliar-foraging (coccinellids) and ground-foraging predators (carabids), potentially affecting intraguild interactions. We evaluated how habitat loss (0, 55 and 84%), fragmentation (1, 4 and 16 fragments) and their combination affected the abundance and species richness of coccinellids and carabids, and aphid abundance, both in the short-term (summer: December to February) and over a longer time span (autumn: March to May), when different demographic mechanisms may participate. We created four types of 30 × 30 m patches (landscapes) in which alfalfa was grown: Control (1F – 0%, 30 × 30 m patch of alfalfa with no fragmentation or habitat loss), 4F – 55% (4 alfalfa fragments, with 55% total habitat loss), 4F – 84% (4 alfalfa fragments, with 84% total habitat loss), and 16F – 84% (16 alfalfa fragments, with 84% total habitat loss). Each landscape type was replicated five times. Insects were sampled by sweep-netting and pitfall traps, from December (summer) to May (autumn). Total abundance and species richness of carabids, in the short-term, was highest in the 16F – 84% landscapes. Total abundance of adult coccinellids was similar among landscapes, but at the species level Hyperaspis sphaeridioides, in the short-term, and Adalia bipunctata, in the long-term, had their highest densities in fragments within landscapes with high habitat loss (84%), independently of habitat fragmentation. Species richness in the long-term was higher in the landscapes with 84% habitat loss. Among aphids, in the long term Aphis craccivora was less abundant in landscapes with high habitat loss and fragmentation (16–84%), while Therioaphis trifolii showed the opposite trend. These results suggest that habitat loss and fragmentation may increase the density and diversity of aphidophagous insects, while their effects on aphids are more variable.

N2  - The hypothesis that small species of aphidophagous coccinellids need lower aphid population densities for reproduction than large species (Dixon, 2007) was tested in the field. In 2006 we compared seasonal changes in the oviposition behaviour of two coccinellid species regularly found in cereal stands in central Europe, the large Coccinella septempunctata L. and the small Propylea quatuordecimpunctata (L.). Adults of both species were collected at 2–3 day intervals from stands of winter wheat and spring barley, females were allowed to deposit eggs for 24 h following collection and the percentage that laid eggs and the number of eggs were recorded. Both species colonized the cereal crop simultaneously in the middle of May. After colonization of the crop, while the aphid density was still low, few females of C. septempunctata oviposited and laid only a few eggs. Oviposition increased up to a maximum c. 1 month later and was closely associated with prey abundance. Of the females of P. quatuordecimpunctata, whose mass is about one quarter of that of the former species, the percentage ovipositing and number of eggs laid varied less in time and was less associated with prey abundance than in C. septempunctata. As predicted by theory, the small P. quatuordecimpunctata was more effective at exploiting the lower prey densities as it produced proportionally more of its eggs during the early stages of the aphid infestation than the larger C. septempunctata.

N2  - In a laboratory experiment, we investigated the preference of larvae and adults of Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) for three aphid species: two essential prey, Acyrthosiphon pisum and Aphis philadelphi, and a toxic prey Aphis sambuci. Surprisingly, the toxic aphid was consumed at twice the rate of the two essential prey species. The stages and genders of the ladybirds did not differ in their preference for aphid species. In the tritrophic interaction, in the field, on the elder host plant Sambucus nigra, A.sambuci is usually avoided by C.septempunctata. To measure ladybird preference, apterous females of the three selected aphid species were released in a Petri dish followed by a ladybird. After four hours, we removed the ladybird, counted the number of aphids of each species that survived, and calculated the number of aphids of each species consumed in total. We examined preference by considering separately the first two aphids consumed by a predator (early feeding), and all remaining aphids consumed thereafter (late feeding). The consumption rates of the first two individuals did not deviate from expected values with no preference; i.e., ladybirds fed on aphids without choice in the beginning of experiment when they were hungry. The ladybirds did express preference thereafter, but our hypothesis that the ladybirds should be able to distinguish among the aphids during later phase of the experiment and choose the most profitable species, or at least distinguish between essential and toxic prey, was rejected.

N2  - Cannibalism and intraguild predation (IGP) are both common phenomena amongst aphidophagous coccinellids and serve as vital alternative feeding strategies which can prolong survival during periods of aphid scarcity. A reduction in essential prey density and the acceptance of conspecific or heterospecific prey are likely to have a considerable influence on both larval development and adult reproduction. However, little is known about the legacy of larval diet on adult performance. This paper considers the effects of the diet provided to larvae of Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) and Adalia bipunctata (Linnaeus) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) on the reproductive output of the resulting females. Results showed that larval diets, including treatments analogous to competition and IGP, did not affect adult longevity, ovipositional lag, proportion of eggs laid in clutches or ovariole number in H. axyridis or A. bipunctata. However, some variation in the maximum clutch size and oviposition rate was seen. A larval diet of unlimited aphids resulted in the largest clutches of eggs being laid by both species. The total number of eggs laid over 30 days was largest for H. axyridis when larvae were reared on unlimited aphids or limited aphids supplemented with either conspecific or heterospecific eggs, whereas oviposition was lower for A. bipunctata females that had received conspecific or heterospecific eggs in their larval diets. The results have also enabled us to make some general comparisons of reproductive parameters between the two species, and to refute the hypothesis that the maximum clutch size laid by a female ladybird is limited by the number of ovarioles within an ovary. We conclude that IGP of A. bipunctata eggs by H. axyridis larvae has a positive effect on reproductive output and is therefore likely to further contribute to the spread and increase of H. axyridis in Britain.

N2  - The sibling species H. yedoensis Takizawa coexists sympatrically and simultaneously with H. axyridis only on pine trees in Japan. To elucidate the mechanisms enabling coexistence of these two sympatric sibling species, a laboratory experiment was performed that focused on differences in their maternal investment through eggs and the role of sibling cannibalism. The egg size (volume) of H. yedoensis was 24.91% larger than that of H. axyridis. Cluster size in H. axyridis was significantly larger than that in H. yedoensis; however, the total number of eggs and oviposition cost (by volume) per female in H. yedoensis were not significantly different from those in H. axyridis, although total number of clusters tended to be slightly higher in H. yedoensis than in H. axyridis. The percentage of undeveloped eggs per cluster in H. yedoensis was not significantly different from that in H. axyridis, whereas the percentage of developed eggs with delayed hatching per cluster was significantly larger in H. yedoensis than in H. axyridis. Moreover, the cost of sibling cannibalism per hatched larval cluster in H. yedoensis (worth 4.43 sibling eggs) was 3.36 times larger than that in H. axyridis.Therefore, maternal investment through egg and sibling cannibalism in developed eggs with delayed hatching are more intense in H. yedoensis than in H. axyridis, implying a higher larval survival rate through higher ability of prey capturing at the first instar. The results in this study suggest that the higher survival rate and accelerated development in H. yedoensis by the two maternal investments, i.e., a large egg and intense sibling cannibalism of developed eggs with delayed hatching, may play an important role in sympatric coexistence with the aggressive aphidophagous ladybird beetle H. axyridis.

The endemic species Olla v-nigrum, Cycloneda munda and Hippodamia convergens were susceptible to B. bassiana Isolate B which was originally isolated from O. v-nigrum and the rate assayed was known to represent the LC50 against O. v-nigrum. However, neither the endemic C. maculata nor the exotic species Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata were susceptible to this isolate at this rate. Additionally, all species of endemic and exotic Coccinellidae used in these assays were resistant to B. bassiana strain GHA and BbAR1 at that rate. We discuss the implications of these results in regard to the establishment of exotic species in new habitats.

N2  - The predatory lacewing Dichochrysa prasina Burmeister can feed and reproduce on various aphid species. However, other species such as the two spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae Koch may serve as an alternative prey for this predator in the field in periods when the population density of aphids is low. In peach orchards in Northern Greece D. prasina larvae are often found during the summer months on leaves infested with T. urticae. The development and reproduction of D. prasina fed on T. urticae at a series of different constant temperatures were studied. The percentages of D. prasina larvae that completed their development when fed on T. urticae ranged from 12 to 60% depending on the temperature over the range from 20 to 30°C, whereas at temperatures above 33°C no larvae survived. Longevity and egg production of D. prasina females fed during the larval stages on T. urticae were also determined and certain demographic parameters such as the intrinsic rate of increase (rm), mean generation time and net reproductive rate were estimated. Over the range of temperatures from 20 to 27°C, the rm values were not significantly different and varied from 0.06629 to 0.07030. Based on the results of the present study, the possible effect of the availability of T. urticae as prey for D. prasina during summer, when its main prey species is scarce, is discussed.

N2  - One of the most important services provided by biodiversity is thought to be the biological control of pests in agricultural landscapes, including aphids on cereals. The food webs potentially contributing to biological control of aphids primarily consist of polyphagous predators, parasitoids and pathogens. The problems of aphid pests have increased greatly since the 1970-ies, possibly as an effect of agricultural intensification, which is thought to have reduced diversity and abundance of these predators and parasites and consequently their biocontrol potential. The main objective of this study was to test this by measuring this potential for biological control of aphids, and relate it to agricultural intensification and predator abundance. We selected 30 farms distributed along agricultural intensification gradients, based on the amount of fertilizers applied per hectare. Estimates of ground-living predator density were obtained using pitfall trapping over a one-week period. Traps were placed inside the cereal fields, 10 m from the margin, in 2 replicates per field. Predation risk due to ground-living predators (biocontrol potential) was estimated by monitoring removal of aphids glued to labels. This was done in the same fields, in the immediate vicinity of the traps, over a period of 2 days. The proportion of aphids eaten per unit time was the response variable. We present the correlations between intensity of agricultural exploitation, predator abundance and biocontrol potential. The outcomes are not straightforward in that intensification begets a reduction in predator density and biocontrol potential. We discuss the potential confounding issues that might have affected our results.

N2  - Emerging parasitoids of aphids encounter secondary plant chemistry from cues left by the mother parasitoid at oviposition and from the plant-feeding of the host aphid. In practice, however, it is secondary plant chemistry on the surface of the aphid mummy which influences parasitoid olfactory behaviour. Offspring of Aphidius colemani reared on Myzus persicae on artificial diet did not distinguish between the odours of bean and cabbage, but showed a clear preference for cabbage odour if sinigrin had been painted on the back of the mummy. Similarly Aphidius rhopalosiphi reared on Metopolophium dirhodum on wheat preferred the odour of wheat plants grown near tomato plants to odour of wheat alone if the wheat plants on which they had been reared had been exposed to the volatiles of nearby tomato plants. Aphidius rhopalosiphi reared on M. dirhodum, and removed from the mummy before emergence, showed a preference for the odour of a different wheat cultivar if they had contacted a mummy from that cultivar, and similar results were obtained with A. colemani naturally emerged from M. persicae mummies. Aphidius colemani emerged from mummies on one crucifer were allowed to contact in sequence (for 45 min each) mummies from two different crucifers. The number of attacks made in 10 min on M. persicae was always significantly higher when aphids were feeding on the same plant as the origin of the last mummy offered, or on the second plant if aphids feeding on the third plant were not included. Chilling emerged A. colemani for 24 h at 5°C appeared to erase the imprint of secondary plant chemistry, and they no longer showed host plant odour preferences in the olfactometer. When the parasitoids were chilled after three successive mummy experiences, memory of the last experience appeared at least temporarily erased and preference was then shown for the chemistry of the second experience.

N2  - The aphid Uroleucon ambrosiae (Thomas) is one of the principal pests found on greenhouse lettuce crops, and there is no efficient biological control agent of this pest in Brazil. This work evaluates the aphid U. ambrosiae as a host for the parasitoid Praon volucre (Haliday), aimed at using P. volucre as a potential biological control agent of U. ambrosiae on lettuce. As Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) is a common host of P. volucre in the field, the development of the parasitoid was compared on these two aphid species. Twenty nymphs of the 2nd instar were kept with P. volucre for one hour at 22 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10% RH and a 12 h photophase. The size of the aphid’s tibiae at the moment of oviposition indicated that there was no significant size difference between U. ambrosiae (0.6 ± 0.02 mm) and M. euphorbiae (0.7 ± 0.03 mm). When mummies were formed, M. euphorbiae had significantly longer tibia (1.5 ± 0.03 mm) than U. ambrosiae (1.4 ± 0.02 mm). No significant differences were detected in the percentage emergence (74.9 ± 7.92 and 87.5% ± 3.31 for U. ambrosiae and M. euphorbiae, respectively), or proportion of female offspring (56.2 ± 7.62 and 44.2 ± 7.14%). The development time from oviposition to adult and longevity of females and males of P. volucre reared on the two host species were not different. High parasitism levels were recorded for both host aphid species, but the percentage parasitism of M. euphorbiae (54.4 ± 4.40) was higher than of U. ambrosiae (35.6 ± 5.30). Female parasitoids reared on M. euphorbiae had longer tibiae (0.78 ± 0.01 mm) than those reared on U. ambrosiae (0.72 ± 0.01 mm). Our results demonstrate that the alternative host species U. ambrosiae, compared to the natural host species M. euphorbiae, affects the female’s size, but did not affect parasitoid development time, longevity, emergence or sex ratio. The parasitoid P. volucre seems to be a good candidate for using as a biological control agent of U. ambrosiae on lettuce in Brazil.

N2  - A suitable host provides, at least, the minimum nutritional and physiological conditions for the development of the immature stages of a parasitoid. Host quality may influence the developmental time, mortality rate, longevity and fecundity of parasitoids. This work evaluates the suitability and quality of Aphis gossypii Glover, Brevicoryne brassicae (Linné), Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch) and Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) as hosts for Aphidius colemani Viereck. Twenty second-instar nymphs of each aphid species were exposed to parasitism for one hour, and then kept in a climatic chamber at 22 ± 1°C, 70 ± 10% RH and a 12 h photophase. The aphid B. brassicae was unsuitable for the development of A. colemani. The different aphid host species varied in size: M. persicae > (R. maidis = S. graminum) > A. gossypii. Parasitoid fitness decreased accordingly when reared on (M. persicae = R. maidis) > S. graminum > A. gossypii. Large hosts seem to be better than small hosts based on parasitoid size. Egg load of A. colemani was related probably more on the ability of the parasitoid larva to obtain nutritional resources from the different host species than on host size.

N2  - During 1989–2006 the number of live aphid, mummies, aphid specialist predators and their parasitoids in cereal fields in Serbia were recorded. S. avenae and M. dirhodum were the most common, both on wheat and rye crops. Maximum numbers of cereal aphids were detected between the end of May and the middle of June. A low percentage of mummified aphids was recorded during May and June, but increased rapidly at the beginning of July, when aphids left the wheat crop. Here, we record over 60 species of cereal aphid natural enemies, including primary and secondary parasitoids, aphid specific predators and a wide spectrum of their parasitoids in Serbian cereal crop systems. Aphidius uzbekistanicus Luzhetzki, Aphidius rhopalosiphi De Stefani, Aphidius ervi Haliday and Praon gallicum Starý were the most abundant species of primary parasitoids. Of the secondary parasitoids, six species were dominant with Asaphes suspensus (Nees) and Dendrocerus carpenteri (Curtis) generally the most often recorded. Coccinella septempunctata L. was the most abundant coccinellid and syrphid flies were represented by 11 species, two of which, Sphaerophoria scripta (L.) and Episyrphus balteatus (DeGeer), were the most common.

N2  - Functioning of plant-aphid-natural enemy interactions may be associated with the structure and composition of withinfield vegetation, neighborhood fields and field borders, and the regional plant community of cropped and noncropped areas. Farmand region-scale vegetation in the wheat-growing area of the North American Great Plains was hypothesized to effect the abundance two hymenopteran parasitoids, that differ in physiological and behavioral attributes, of the key pest aphid of wheat, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko). The parasitoids had greater sensitivity to farm-scale vegetation (wheat strip rotation with or without spring-sown sunflower) than region-scale vegetation (degree of diversification with other crops and wheat fields converted to conservation grasslands). A two-way factorial design of scale (farm- and region-scale) revealed that parasitoid abundance in grass-dominant (homogeneous) areas especially benefited from adding sunflower to the wheat-fallow strip crop rotation. Considerable sensitivity of the analysis was added when adjusting for seasonality of vegetation, revealing that the region-scale effects were most prominent late season. From a management viewpoint, adding sunflower into the wheat production system, especially in relatively homogeneous vegetation regions, tends to promote local parasitoid populations during the summer when spring-sown plants are maturing and wheat is not in cultivation. Contrasting results for A. albipodus and L. testaceipes were consistent with expectations based on behavioral and physiological attributes of the two aphid parasitoid families they represent. Still, the general management interpretation seems robust for the two parasitoids and has relevance to both farm- and region-scale management schemes that are occurring in the wheat production zone of North American Great Plains.

N2  - In the sorghum/aphid/ladybeetle ecosystem found in the Texas High Plains Region of the United States, we found that the corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), is a key aphid species that provides a critical early-season food source for native coccinellids. From 1988 to 2000 data on the seasonal abundance of sorghum-infesting aphids and ladybeetles were collected from a total of 21 irrigated and 12 rain-fed grain sorghum fields. The data indicated that successful biological control of the greenbug by coccinellids is normally dependent on early-season colonization of the sorghum field by corn leaf aphids. When corn leaf aphids exceeded 100/plant before sorghum boot stage greenbugs never exceeded 125 aphids/plant. In all cases where greenbugs were found in densities that would cause economic damage to sorghum (>250/plant), corn leaf aphids reached a density of 100 or more per plant after sorghum reached the boot stage. In irrigated fields, the first record of coccinellid eggs and peak coccinellid abundance were positively and significantly (p = 0.05) correlated to the day of the year when corn leaf aphids reached or exceeded a minimum of 100/plant and corn leaf aphid peak abundance in both irrigated and rainfed fields. On the other hand, greenbug peak abundance was significantly correlated only to coccinellid peak abundance in irrigated fields. Regression analyses indicated that in paired analyses of irrigated and rain-fed sorghum fields, an increase of one aphid at time t, resulted in an increase in coccinellid peak abundance from 0.024 to 0.025 per 15 m of row at time t + 2 depending on aphid species, if corn leaf aphids reached a level of 100 or more per plant by sorghum boot stage and irrigation parameters. We concluded that corn leaf aphids are an important early-season food source for predaceous coccinellids, drawing these predators into the fields where they feed on the aphids and deposit eggs, engendering a captive larval population that is present when greenbug first begin to enter the field later in the season.

N2  - A two-year field experiment was conducted to determine whether a conservation biological control strategy could be applied to enhance the biological control of green apple aphids, Aphis spp., in a high-density and scab-resistant apple orchard at the non-bearing stage. The natural occurrence of aphid predators and their impact on aphid populations were evaluated in 2005. The impact of predation on aphid densities was evaluated by comparing a predator exclusion treatment with a control. In 2006, the possibility to enhance predator abundance/performance and aphid biological control with a flowering ground cover was tested: trees were grown either with a flowering ground cover of phacelia, Phacelia tanacetifolia Bentham, and buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum Moench, or with a conventional ground cover of mixed Poaceae species. In 2006, it was also determined whether aphid densities differ between Liberty and Topaz, 2 scab-resistant cultivars. Results indicate that the predatory arthropod community was dominated by Coccinellidae, Cecidomyiidae, and various spider species. The ladybird community was dominated by the exotic species Harmonia axyridis Pallas, and the abundance of this species was correlated with aphid density. Naturally occurring predators had little impact on aphid abundance, although the proportion of trees with aphid colonies was greater in the predator exclusion treatment on two consecutive dates in 2005. Ground cover types had no impact on aphid densities. The oviposition response of Cecidomyiidae to aphid density was greater in Liberty trees with flowering ground cover than with the conventional ground cover. Conversely, the response of ladybird adults to aphid density was more important in Topaz trees with the conventional ground cover than with the flowering ground cover. Finally, no difference occurred in aphid abundance between Liberty and Topaz trees. Those results are discussed from a biological control and ecological point of view.

N2  - Habitat management is a form of conservation biological control, that includes strategies such as the provision of alternative prey for natural enemies. One example is the "banker plants" strategy, which consists of introducing cereals with aphids in horticultural crops. It is usually combined with parasitoid releases. In this work we evaluated whether aphid-infested barley as "banker plants" enhances native populations of aphidophagous syrphids and extends the residence time of Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer) following release. The work was performed in four replicated sweet-pepper commercial greenhouses in the southeast of Spain. Barley was sown, and infested with the aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch). Visual censuses were performed to record released individuals of E. balteatus (marked on the thorax before release) and naturally occurring hoverflies. At the end of the experiment leaf samples were taken to the laboratory, and the immature syrphids were reared for identification. The occurrence of syrphids that come from outside the greenhouse was significantly increased by the presence of the infested barley plants. From a total of 506 observations of adult native syrphids, 81% were Sphaerophoria rueppellii (Wiedemann). We did not find significant differences between control plots and those provided with banker plants in their probabilities to retain released specimens of E. balteatus. Of the syrphids collected at immature stages from the barley leaves, we did not record any E. balteatus, and 100% of the specimens were identified as S. rueppellii. We conclude that the banker plant strategy is effective in attracting natural populations of syrphids into sweet pepper greenhouses, but not in keeping released individuals of E. balteatus in the greenhouses long enough to lay eggs. We suggest that the E. balteatus release method should be amended.

N2  - Enhancing biological control in orchards is an efficient way to control insect pests. This study investigates the possibility of increasing biological control of spirea aphid by providing alternate food resources, in the form of peach extrafloral nectar, to adult Harmonia axyridis, its primary predator. Two pairs of apple orchards, each having one interplanted with 50% trees bearing extrafloral nectar and one a monoculture, were studied for aphid and predator populations from 1999 to 2005. There were no differences in spirea aphid or predator populations between interplanted and monoculture orchards. However, H. axyridis adults arrived earlier in the interplanted than in the monoculture orchards. In another apple orchard, the effect of peach extrafloral nectar on sentinel spirea aphid colonies surrounding a cluster of potted peach trees, or a cluster of apple trees as a control, was tested in 2007. Only the closest spirea colonies to the potted peach trees, trees within 3 m, showed an increase in biological control. Although there was some indication of enhancement of predation by adult H. axyridis on spirea aphids, adding alternative food resources in the form of peach trees bearing extrafloral nectar resulted in no detectable increase in biological control.

N2  - During the years 1994–1999, several hundreds of thousands of H. axyridis adults were released at various cultivations infested by aphids (citrus, vegetable and bean crops, maize etc.) and on ornamental plants in urban settings in central and southern Greece (mainly Attica and Peloponessos region) as well as on several islands. Between 1995–1999, spring sampling was conducted in some areas, just prior to releases, in order to determine if H. axyridis overwintered in the field. No presence of H. axyridis was recorded in any of the orchards where the predator had been released save in spring of 1998 and 1999 when small colonies (
