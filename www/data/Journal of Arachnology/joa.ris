N2  - Comparative anatomical studies are carried out on representatives of the Arachnida, Merostomata, and Pycnogonida with respect to (a) circulatory morphology, and (b) the morphological significance of the muscles which insert on the endosternite. A morphological relationship of the chelicerate arterial system to the endosternite is demonstrated, and evidence is brought forth that this is a primitive relationship in chelicerates. A comparative analysis of the chelicerate endosternite provides evidence that it has evolved by fusion of an arterial membrane with the connective tissue of serial, paired, transverse and dorsoventral muscles. A hypothetical model of the primitive chelicerate endosternite is reconstructed. Specimens dissected and/or sectioned include representative genera of each arachnid order; the xiphosuran, Limulus; and seven genera of pycnogonids. The endosternites of merostomes and arachnids are interpreted to be homologous structures, and the transverse suspensor muscles of the endosternite a...

N2  - The higher categories of the Vejovidae have been revised and keys to these categories are presented. As part of the revision a new subfamily, the Hadrurinae, has been recognized. In the subfamily Syntropinae a new genus, Vejovoidus, has been introduced. In the subfamily Vejovinae new genera recognized are Serradigitus and Pseudouroctonus. Thirteen species previously placed in the genus Uroctonus have been shown to belong to the genus Vejovis. An extensive study of the value of trichobothria in scorpion systematics is presented. The systematic status of Uroctonus fractus is doubtful. It has been eliminated from the Vejovidae and apparently should be placed in the Chactidae where it will undoubtedly be synonymized.

N2  - A systematic review of spiders of the family Leptonetidae in North America is presented with analyses of their characters and relationships. Reasons are given for using only two generic names for the 44 taxa of this fauna, most of which are described as new. The subfamily Leptonetinae includes all representatives of the world fauna in which the posterior median eyes are situated far back of the posterior lateral eyes. The genus Leptoneta, which is the basic standard of the family and occurs widely in Palearctica, is considered to include all but three of the American species. Its disjunct distribution in North America makes possible treatment of different faunas of four quite discrete centers of distribution. The largest fauna of 15 species occurs in the southern Appalachian Mountains, includes six epigean species and nine cavernicoles; of the latter one from Georgia is an eyeless troglobite and others have eyes in various stages of reduction.

N2  - A conspicuous faunal element in hot dry desert regions worldwide, scorpions rely on a combination of behavioral, morphological and physiological adaptations in adjusting to harsh conditions found in these habitats. Foremost among behavioral adaptations are the exploitation of burrowing and nocturnal habits which provide a temporary escape from extreme daytime temperatures and desiccating air at the surface. Associated with these habits may be enlarged pedipalps used in digging and the presence of negative phototactic responses and orthokinetic avoidance of high temperatures. Still, lethal temperatures (45&#176; to 47&#176;C) of desert scorpions are higher than most other desert arthropods, and the presence of water-proofing wax layers which are perhaps supplemented by cuticular proteins provide scorpions with an impervious integument. Water loss rates approaching 0.01% of their body weight per hour (25&#176;C) are the lowest reported for desert animals and are especially significant in view of their high surface area-vo...

N2  - Feeding on inviable eggs by spiderlings is known to occur in several families. This activity has been observed in the first (quiescent) instar only, leading to the general belief that this first instar always undertakes the utilization of such eggs. However, the present study indicates that egg feeding occurs in the second instar in Achaearanea tepidariorum (Theridiidae), with the reduction in time period of the quiescent instar. There seems to be a tendency in the Theridiidae (and, perhaps, in some related families as well) toward the elimination of the quiescent instar. Egg-feeding considerably extends the life span of spiderlings and, sometimes, provides enough nourishment to carry spiderlings to the third instar without additional food intake.

N2  - Species belonging to the opilionid genera Caddo, Acropsopilio, Austropsopilio and Cadella are herein considered to constitute the family Caddidae. The subfamily Caddinae contains the genus Caddo; the other genera are placed in the subfamily Acropsopilioninae. It is suggested that the palpatorid Opiliones be grouped in three superfamilies: Caddoidea (including the family Caddidae), Phalangioidea (including the families Phalangiidae, Liobunidae, Neopilionidae and Sclerosomatidae) and Troguloidea (including the families Trogulidae, Nemostomatidae, Ischyropsalidae and Sabaconidae). North American members of the Caddidae are discussed in detail, and a new species, Caddo pepperella, is described. The North American caddids appear to be mostly parthenogenetic, and C. pepperella is very likely a neotenic isolate of C. agilis.

N2  - Phidippus audax (Hentz) has been considered a single variable species by some taxonomists and two or more distinct species by others. Individual northern and southern specimens, though similar, can usually be distinguished by differences in size and markings evident even to the naked eye. Closer examination, however, failed to reveal consistent differences in morphology between northern and southern populations. Observed behavioral patterns that were compared also failed to show discernible differences. Laboratory cultures of separate and mixed populations were maintained through three generations. Conversely, inter-geographical cross-matings indicated a degree of incompatibility between the populations. Matings between northern and southern specimens were less successfully achieved than intra-geographical matings. The number of viable young produced by cross-mated females was consistently less than the number produced by females mated to males from their own region. Further, the progeny of cross-bred spi...

N2  - The generic name Ozyptila Simon, 1864 is stabilized by the identification of the type-species O. claveata (Walckenaer) 1837 as conspecific with O. nigrita (Thorell) 1875, the latter becoming a junior synonym of claveata. The 22 species and two subspecies comprising the genus Ozyptila in North America are described or redescribed, keyed, and illustrated. The floridana group contains five species from eastern or southeastern United States and Mexico. O. peon Gertsch, 1953 and O. imitata Gertsch, 1953, known hitherto from female and male, respectively, are newly recognized as conspecific under the name imitata. The brevipes group contains 15 species and two subspecies from various regions of North America, of which O. distans and O. curvata are described as new species and O. sincera canadensis and O. sincera oraria are described as new subspecies. O. bryantae Gertsch, 1939 is synonymized under O. conspurcata Thorell, 1877, O. bison Gertsch, 1953 under O. beaufortensis Strand, 1916, O. barrowsi Gertsch, 1939...

N2  - Field observations of sympatric Centuroides sculpturatus and Diplocentrus spitzeri scorpions in the Peloncillo Mountains in New Mexico revealed that during the warmer months nocturnal extra-rock surface activity was relatively great in the former species. In contrast, D. spitzeri tended to remain beneath rocks near the openings of its burrows. During the day C. sculpturatus also used the rocks as shelter, clinging to the underside. Actograph studies of both species showed them both to have nocturnal activity when imposed photoperiod was the only variable; however, only C. spitzeri displayed an endogenous circadian rhythm in constant darkness. Rooftop observations of D. spitzeri confined to containers, each with soil and a rock for shelter, indicated that under poor shelter conditions extra-rock nocturnal activity is common for early instars through adults. In another rooftop study D. spitzeri adults exhibited random choice of available rock shelter. It was concluded that different spatial and temporal str...

N2  - The heart and arterial (efferent) circulatory system in Argas radiatus and Ornithodoros turicata (Argasidae) and in Ixodes scapularis, Dermacentor variabilis and Amblyomma tuberculatum (Ixodidae) are consistent in form with the plan observed in other apulmonate Arachnida. Specialized sinuses or vessels for channelization of venous (afferent) hemolymph are absent, but heart, arterial vessels and sinuses are well-developed. The heart lies in a sinus formed by the pericardial septum which is continuous with connective tissue processes of dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral suspensory muscles of the heart. Hemolymph flows from the pericardial sinus into two segmental cardiac cavities via two pairs of ostia. Walls of this pulsatile portion of the heart are formed from radiating muscle bands. On contraction, hemolymph is pumped through an anterior thin-walled heart region (aortic-myocardial cone), past an aortic septal valve which prevents back flow, into the anterior aorta and on to the periganglionic sinus.

N2  - Both in the laboratory and in the field prey capture did not have a strong influence upon web-site tenacity of Argiope aurantia. But experimental web destruction increased the probability that A. aurantia changed its web-site, perhaps only due to the physical displacement of the spider. Removal of vegetation near the web of immature A. aurantia resulted in most of these spiders leaving their web-sites, especially in areas less sheltered from the wind. Argiope trifasciata, in contrast, did not leave web-sites after removal of nearby vegetation.

N2  - The use of pitfall trapping and quadrat sampling in ecological studies of spiders is discussed. Comparison of these methods in studies of species diversity shows pitfall trapping to give a closer estimate of the total number of species in a community. Limiting the method to studies of cursorial forms, like wandering spiders, may diminish sampling error due to differential species activity. Several conditions for limited use of pitfall trapping in ecological research are proposed. Improvements in trap dispersion and trap design are presented which may substantially reduce sampling errors. Descriptors: Pitfall trapping, ecological methods, wandering spiders.

N2  - Two distinct types of population structure are present in the spider Achaearanea tepidariorum, each with totally different dynamics and behavior. The floating population or dispersion stage is composed entirely of second instar spiderlings, representing about 99 per cent of the total produced by the species. This population is characterized by a very diverse genetic composition and a high mortality. Several different strategies are observed in spiders in general to reduce mortality in the second instar. The established population is composed of individuals with snaring webs and sedentary habits, and begins as an immature population after the invasion of an available habitat by the second instar. During this phase, its numbers increase first at the maximum intrinsic rate until the maximum habitat capacity has been reached. In a mature population more than 65 per cent of the biomass is contributed by the adult individuals.

N2  - Life histories and distribution patterns were reconstructed from random vacuum samples of coexistent populations of nine species of hunting spiders in an Ontario meadow. The populations of Pardosa saxatilis (Hentz), Pirata minutus Emerton, Schizocosa avida (Walckenaer), S. heasmani Dondale, and S. crassipalpis (Emerton) had annual life histories, and matured, mated, and oviposited in the spring or early summer.

X. discursans Keyserling was biennial, and matured and reproduced in the spring. Lycosa frondicola Emerton was also biennial, but matured in late summer and reproduced the following spring. Most of the nine species were more densely represented in the lower, moister part of the meadow, whereas S. heasmani, individuals of which are very similar in anatomy to those of S. avida, was more densely represented on the higher, dryer pa...

N2  - Heteronebo granti Pocock, and Heteronebo forbesii Pocock are redescribed and lectotypes designated. The two subfamilies of Diplocentridae are recognized, and briefly diagnosed polythetically for the first time: Nebinae is monotypic, and apparently endemic to the Middle East; Diplocentrinae is polytypic, and apparently confined to the New World, with the exception of Heteronebo which is endemic to the small island of Abd-el-Kuri, Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen. Taxonomic, systematic, and biogeographic problems presented by Heteronebo spp. are discussed.

N2  - Two emendations to Stahnke's (1974) &quot;Revision and keys to the higher categories of Vejovidae&quot; are given. First, Stahnke's nomenclatorial decision to use the spelling &quot;Vejovis&quot;, rather than the correct original spelling of Vaejovis Koch, is based on an inappropriate article of the Code, and contradicts the ruling relative to this nomenclatorial problem. Thus, Vaejovidae, Vaejovinae, and Vaejovis are the correct spellings for the family, subfamily, and genus, respectively. Taxonomically, the holotype of Physoctonus physurus Mello-Leitao is redescribed, establishing that this supposedly vaejovid taxon is a junior synonym of Rhopalurus debilis (Koch), belonging to the family Buthidae.

N2  - Web clumping by female Nephila clavipes is not a social phenomenon but rather a random process influenced by population density and number of suitable web sites. There is an uneven distribution of males in the webs of mature females, and it is believed that web clumping may actually be disadvantageous if a less attractive female constructs a web adjacent to a more attractive one. Larger females spin larger webs, so adjacent smaller females may suffer reduced feeding efficiency and hence reduced growth rate and lowered fecundity. Males attempt to mate with females when the latter are feeding, and in multiple-male webs, the males fight among themselves for females. If dominance hierarchies among males exist, it is predicted that they are only temporary, either because of inherent instability or because of male transcience.

N2  - Diplocentrus mexicanus Peters is reestablished as the valid type species of the genus Diplocentrus Peters. The type of D. mexicanus has been lost, but the published information is sufficient to establish that this taxon is not synonymous with D. whitei (Gervais) as previously maintained. Accordingly, a neotype for D. mexicanus is designated and described. The exact type locality of D. mexicanus is still unknown because the incomplete data accompanying the neotype, and one additional known specimen referable to this species, only indicate that they were collected in Mexico. A new subspecies has been found in the state of Oaxaca, D. mexicanus oaxacae, n. ssp., and for this reason alone the description of the nominate subspecies is included here. Seven other species of Diplocentrus are recorded from Oaxaca, including four new ones: D. tehuano, n. sp., D. hoffmanni, n. sp., D. reticulatus, n. sp., and D. mitlae, n. sp..

N2  - The genus Leiobunum is widely distributed in the eastern United States and has been under investigation since Thomas Say described L. vittatum as the first North American species in 1821. Several species have been described by various workers since Say, but the characteristics used in describing them have often been highly variable and of little taxonomic value. Measurements such as total leg length and body length have been standard parts of species descriptions for many years. Such characters are often not definitive and may cause confusion and misidentification when derived from single specimens or small collections as has often been the case. The value of several measurements used in taxonomic descriptions of species of Leiobunum is evaluated in this paper, and the separation of two closely related species which have previously been collectively referred to as L. politum is demonstrated.

N2  - Phidippus Johnsoni males employ three different mating tactics. The one used depends on the type of female that the male encounters. With adult females outside nests, they use type 1 courtship, which is a form of visual communication and includes displays such as dancing and posturing. Similar courtship has been described for many salticid species. With adult females inside nests, males use type 2 courtship, which is a form of non-visual communication and includes elements such as probing and vibrating of the nest. This type of courtship is similar to that of some web-building spiders, and behavior of this type has generally received little attention in previous studies of salticid behavior. When pursuing subadult females inside nests, males use type 2 courtship followed by cohabitation. Postmount courtship is a non-visual phase that precedes copulation and occurs as a component of each tactic. The different types of courtship involve distinctly different motor patterns. In addition to male courtship sign...

N2  - The courtship behavior of Schizocosa rovneri Uetz and Dondale is described and analyzed. Courtship behavior in this species is distinct from that of Schizocosa ocreata (Hentz), although these species are morphologically very similar and indistinguishable on the basis of genitalia. Males of both species courted conspecific and heterospecific females with almost equal frequency. However, females only responded receptively and copulated with conspecific males. Males of S. rovneri exhibited quantitative differences in aspects of courtship behavior in response to different stimuli. In the presence of a conspecific female, the searching phase was shorter and less variable, and the stridulation bouts were three times as frequent than with heterospecific females. Values of these parameters for male S. rovneri with only the silk (and pheromone) of a conspecific female were intermediate. Data on habital and seasonal occurrence of the two species suggest that S. ocreata breeds earlier in the season and prefers uplan...

N2  - Orb-weaving spiders of the species Araneus sericatus demonstrate a reflex among the first or second pair of legs in response to vibrational pulses delivered to the substrate. This response served as the dependent variable in determining the absolute threshold sensitivity to vibration. Sensitivity was best (smallest displacement amplitudes) in the region of 125 hertz. The reaction time of the response was inversely related to vibration intensity. The response occurred within 100 milliseconds for suprathreshold stimuli. This study confirms, by a behavioral method, the frequency response range of the orb-weaver as indicated in physiological research. Evidence is given which shows that A. sericatus can respond to acoustical stimuli at frequencies greater than about 300 hertz.

N2  - Natural diet of the oxyopid, Peucetia viridans, was analyzed over a ten month period. This spider is a euryphagous predator; of the 189 prey items recorded in the field there were 65 species of prey. Major diet items included species of Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera and Orthoptera. Conspecifics represented the fourth major prey species, but interspecific predation was found to be relatively rare. Phenological analysis of prey composition indicates that there is a large change in major prey taxa with time. Monthly prey composition probably reflects relative prey availability. The percent of adult males feeding in the field was not significantly different from that of adult females. Prey size exhibited a highly significant correlation to predator body size.

N2  - 1. This study discusses a complex habitat selection strategy exhibited by a hunting spider species, the wolf spider Lycosa santrita, occupying desert riparian habitats in southeastern Arizona. 2. Field censuses of spider activity on various substrates show that significant associations exist between spiders and grass. This substrate provides the most predictable energy investment in prey capture of all natural substrates in the study area. 3. Mature spiders show less association with grass than younger spiders. Upon maturing, females move from the woodland area where grass is prominent to patches of bare ground and rock bordering a creek. Adult males also leave the woodland and settle in patches of leaf litter adjacent to the creek bed. 4. Available prey is shown to be highest on the bare ground substrate. As prey numbers were not found to differ significantly on any substrate through time, location changes made by adult spiders cannot be a reflection of temporal changes in local prey abundance. 5.

N2  - The study of the type specimens of the species of Eustiromastix as well as from some large collections of undetermined material, has allowed us to establish the following new combinations and synonymies: Eustiromastix rufohirtus Simon, 1902=Freya rufohirta (Simon, 1902) n.comb.; Evophyrys keyserlingi Taczanowski, 1879 = Eustiromastix keyserlingi (Taczanowski, 1879) n.comb.; E. styliferus Simon, 1902 = E. major Simon, 1902; Theratoscirtus affinis Caporiacco, 1954 = E. major Simon, 1902; E. obscurus Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1942 [non E. obscurus (Peckham &amp; Peckham, 1893)]= E. parobscurus Roewer, 1951 = E. pantherinus Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1942. The name Eustiromastix obscurus Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1942 is a primary homonym of E. obscurus (Peckham &amp; Peckham, 1893), type species of the genus. The species was given the new name E. parobscurus Roewer, 1951. In the present paper we establish that E. obscurus Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1942 and E. pantherinus Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1942 are synonyms, so the taxon has three synonyms. The name E. obscurus Mello-L...

Information about the behavior was obtained from analysis of ten 8mm movie films, and 50 direct observations of individual prey capture sequences. An ethogram was constructed which depicts the interrelationships between the discrete behavioral components; e.g., alert stance, grasp success, and sting. Most individuals also exhibit a pedipalpal sand thrust, which may function in a cleaning capacity.

N2  - Cupiennius salei Keys. was collected in the highlands of central Gautemala near Cob&#225;n (departamento Alta Verapaz). It was found mostly on agaves and on banana plants in coffee plantations near the tropical rain forest. The favorite retreat is at the base of agaves and behind the trough-shaped basal parts of banana leaf sheaths. Showing pronounced rhythmicity in its diurnal locomotor activity, the spider leaves its retreat after dusk to hunt; cockroaches and earwigs were the animals most frequently preyed upon. Included is an account of recent research on this species and of the geographic range and taxonomic placements assigned to it in the literature.

N2  - Orientation of the body with respect to gravity by Nephila clavipes (L.) spiderlings were scored from the beginning of emergence from the egg sac until the onset of dispersion in the laboratory. Most second instar spiderlings adopted the dorsal-down attitude by the end of the seventh day. A change from dorsal-down to anterior (face)-down attitude-that of spiders living in geometric webs-was apparent on the eighth day, by third instar animals after they had completed the second molt and returned to the communal web. The anterior-down attitude predominated by the time dispersion began.

The synonymy of Amacataidae Muma 1971 = Daesiidae Roewer 1934 is proposed. The family Daesiidae, known so far in Africa, Spain and the Near Esst is recorded here for the first time in South America, with the following genera for this region: Amacata Muma 1971 and Syndaesia, new genus. The more important similarities between the males of these two genera consist in the presence in both of a tubular flagellum, traversed by a duct and with an opening at each extremity, and also in the structure of the movable cheliceral finger. The principal differences concern the general shape of the flagellum; the structure of the fixed cheliceral finger and the tarsal segmentation and spine-like armature. Except for these two last characters, females of both genera are very similar. /// En este trabajo se describe un nuevo g&#233;nero y especie de sol&#237;fugo de la Argentina: Syndaesia mastix, al ...

Tortembolus Crosby and Bactroceps Chamberlin and Ivie are synonymized with Spirembolus. &quot;Erigone&quot; chilkatensis Chamberlin and Ivie has been transferred to Spirembolus, while Spirembolus chera Chamberlin and Ivie, S. cheronis Chamberlin, S. oreinoides Chamberlin, S. vasingtonus Chamberlin (nomen nudum) and Tortembolus approximatus Chamberlin have been excluded from the genus. Spirembolus orthus Chamberlin is a synonym of S. whitneyanus.

N2  - Units of predatory behavior, described in four species of Cyrtophora, include resting positions, jerking and tensing of the web, web shaking, prey immobilization, cutting and pulling out, transportation to the hub and manipulation of the prey at the hub. With the exception of web-shaking behavior, all units of behavior are of the &quot;advanced&quot; type that occurs also in spiders of the genera Argiope, Araneus and Eriophora. Four different attack sequences are given to different prey types. Two of these involve immobilization by biting and two immobilization by wrapping. Prey are transported to the hub either on a silk thread or in the chelicerae. The predatory behavior of Cyrtophora differs from that of Argiope and Eriophora in the following respects: (a) the spider does not maintain dragline connection with the hub, (b) immobilization wrapping is generally restricted to beetles, pentatomid bugs, and large insects, (c) prey are never left in the web after immobilization, but always carried immediately to the hu...

N2  - Similarities between the mating strategy of the males of Phidippus johnsoni and models for optimal foraging are discussed. A predator encounters potential prey, each of which has an associated search time ( S&lt;sub&gt; i&lt;/sub&gt;) and pursuit time ( P&lt;sub&gt; i&lt;/sub&gt;) per net benefit. In principle, net benefit (benefits minus costs or risks) should be expressed in units of fitness. Males of P. johnsoni encounter females differing in location and maturity, each of which has an associated S&lt;sub&gt; i&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt; i&lt;/sub&gt;. The numerators of P&lt;sub&gt; i&lt;/sub&gt; vary in the following order: adult female outside nest (ca. 2 min), adult inside nest (16 min), subadult inside nest (1 week). Denominators seem to follow the opposite trend. Considering fertility, sperm competition, cannibalism, predation, and male-male aggressive interactions, net benefit for males seems to be least if they pursue adult females outside nests, greater if they pursue adults inside nests, and greatest if they pursue subadults inside nests.

N2  - The family Hexathelidae is newly erected. Three subfamilies are recognized: Plesiothelinae, for the monotypic Tasmanian genus Plesiothele; Macrothelinae, confined to Macrothele, Porrhothele and Atrax; and the Hexathelinae include Hexathele, Scotinoecus, Bymainiella, Paraembolides, gen. nov. and Terania, gen. nov. The synapomorphic character required for group membership is numerous labial cuspules. Using the size of the anterior lateral spinnerets, the development of megaspines on the first tibia of males, the paraembolic apophysis, and shape of the labium and other characters, the evolution of subfamilies, genera and some species is discussed using Hennigian principles. A biogeographic hypothesis is proposed using the vicariance events of Plate Tectonic theory. The sister group of the Hexathelidae is the Dipluridae, and the sister group of both is the Mecicobothriidae. The subfamily Ischnothelinae is erected to receive those genera of the traditional Macrothelinae that have no labial cuspules.

Additional methods studies are needed for species not consistently susceptible to can trap collections, and for attaining greater reliability for data on the relative densities of solpugid species.

N2  - Pitfall traps of four types were used at three woodland sites over twelve months in an empirical study of the effect of trap efficiency in describing species composition of spider communities. There was a certain degree of agreement between trap-types in terms of seasonal variations and relative numbers of species and of individuals at the three sites. Due to the different responses of the various species, distortions were evident in the communities' species frequency curves. This was significantly apparent at one of the sites and less so at the others. The more &quot;efficient&quot; methods used here captured disproportionately more species in relation to the greater number of individuals. The probability of analogous distortions in data from other sampling methods is discussed.

N2  - Polymorphism is documented in species of the genus Phiale. Controlled rearing of Phiale tristis Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1945 demonstrated the existence of a chromatic sex-controlled polymorphism, with polymorphic females and monomorphic males. There is strong evidence that other three species are also polymorphic: Phiale mimica (Koch), P. crocea Koch and Phiale ortrudae, new species. These four species together with Phiale bulbosa (Cambridge), new combination (of which only the male holotypus is known), form a homogeneous group within the genus Phiale. Seven specific names are synonymized: Phiale mutilloides Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1947 = P. tristis Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1945; P. rubrosericea Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1947 = P. tristis; P. nigrosigillata Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1947 = P. tristis; Freya bella (C.

N2  - Collections of Phrynus from all available localities from the Americas have been examined. Collections from other parts of the world tropics have also been examined in the search for a better characterization of the three families of amblypygids which lack pulvilli in the tarsi of their ambulatory legs. The gensus Phrynus has been found to occur only in the Americas and a redefinition of the Phrynidae is given. Of the 24 species of Phyrnus described for the Americas, 12 species are considered as valid and redescribed. The three species described by Franganillo, Phrynus pinarensis, P. viridescens and P. rangelensis are considered species Incertae Sedis. Three new species are described; one, P. damonidaensis, presents a character unique within the family Phrynidae: three tibial segments in leg IV instead of four. Five new synonymies are recognized. Natural history data are presented for some of the species of Phrynus.

N2  - Water loss rates, cuticular permeability, metabolic rates and rhythms were determined for the troglobitic spider, Lycosa howarthi, and an undescribed epigean spider, Lycosa sp., collected from lava tube caves and lava flows, respectively, on the Island of Hawaii. The cuticular lipid and hydrocarbon surface densities as well as an analysis of the hydrocarbon fraction were also determined for each species and correlated with their different cuticular permeabilities. Water loss for the cave species was significantly higher at each test humidity, with the maximum difference between the species occuring at 19&#176;C and 0% RH (&lt;tex-math&gt;$11.14\pm 1.76\ {\rm mg}\ {\rm g}^{-1}\ {\rm h}^{-1}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; vs &lt;tex-math&gt;$1.01\pm 0.33\ {\rm mg}\ {\rm g}^{-1}\ {\rm h}^{-1}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;).

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships of some chactoid genera are analyzed. The number of lateral eyes, the only character used to separate the families Chactidae and Vaejovidae, is rejected because of considerable intrageneric, intergeneric, and interfamilial variability. The value of trichobothrial numbers and patterns in scorpion systematics is discussed, and the terminologies proposed by both Stahnke and Vachon are considered to be of limited value in phylogeny reconstruction because they postulate incongruent homologies. The following sister-group relationships and monophyletic taxa are hypothesized: Caraboctonus + Hadruroides = Caraboctonini, new; Hadrurus = Hadrurini, new; Caraboctonini + Hadrurini = Caraboctoninae; Calchas + Iurus = Iurinae; Caraboctoninae + Iurinae = Iuridae, new rank.

N2  - In order to examine the effects of clearcutting on the spider community of a southern Appalachian forest, spider populations in a mature forest, an adjacent clearcut site, and two other clearcut sites were sampled during the summer of 1976 with four techniques: pitfall trapping, Tullgren funnel extraction of litter spiders, sweep netting, and hand collecting. Clearcutting resulted in a marked reduction in spider abundance and a small decrease in the number of spider species. Spider species diversity increased, owing to a marked increase in the evenness component of diversity. While clearcutting greatly reduced the abundance and number of species of web building spiders (both ground-dwelling and aerial species), there was apparently little or no reduction in numbers of hunting spiders. In addition, the number of hunting spider species increased. It is postulated that microclimate changes resulting from removal of the forest canopy and reduced litter thickness were primarily responsible for the decline in a...

N2  - An improved and simple technique is described for determining the magnitude of the recently observed phenomenon of supercontraction of major ampullate silk fibers of orb-web-building spiders. Supercontraction ratios obtained by the use of that method and also from an instrumental method are given. It is seen that only three levels of supercontraction are found among twenty two species of orb-web-building spiders. The data are presented on the basis of taxonomic classification and are subjected to statistical analyses in order to determine which ones may be effectively differentiated from the others. A contribution to the integerity of the wetted web is suggested as a function for the retractive driving force which underlies supercontraction. Mention is made of the possible usefulness of supercontraction as a taxonomic symptom.

N2  - The three populations of S. abboti studied exhibit much higher densities than the two of S. rufipes. In S. abboti mating occurs in July, egg laying in August, hatching in September, and the fully equipped and self-sufficient third instar spiderlings develop by November. The tubes of S. abboti are proportionately longer and have a greater aerial length to underground length ratio than do those of S. rufipes. Other differences in tube architecture exist. Both species capture and feed upon a wide variety of ground arthropods and discard prey remains through the upper end of the tube. S. abboti males search for mates in daylight and appear to be generalized wasp-ant mimics. Our observations of S. abboti male behavior suggests that adult female tubes are marked by a contact sex pheromone.

N2  - After re-examination of the type specimen of Corosoma sellowi Karsch, the genus is transferred from the chernetid subfamily Lamprochernetinae to the Chernetinae (no tactile seta on tibia of leg IV, flagellum of three blades). Probably it is closely related to Dasychernes Chamberlin. Some external adaptive characters suggest a way of life similar to that of Dasychernes, which is known to inhabit nests of meliponine bees.

N2  - Wandering spiders from three communities representing points on a successional gradient (old field, oak and beech-mapie forests) were sampled with pitfall traps and compared at the levels of species, family and guild. There was little similarity (species overlap) between communities. Species diversity was highest in the sub-climax forest and considerably lower in the mature beech-maple forest. This successional trend in species diversity is discussed in light of current hypotheses. Analysis of guild composition showed that, with succession, the relative abundance of wolf spiders decreased while that of vagrant web builders and crab spiders increased. Of the seven families sampled, only members of the Clubionidae occurred in fairly sizeable proportions in each community. Structure of the litter is discussed as a factor influencing cursorial spider abundance and distribution.

N2  - As Gondwanaland fragmented due to plate tectonics, each of the southern continents carried with it a sample of the ancestral biota. Bothriurid scorpions are known from South America and Australia, and if this taxon was part of that ancestral biota then bothriurids would be predicted to occur in southern Africa as well. The genus Lisposoma Lawrence, currently placed in the Scorpionidae, lacks any demonstrable synapomorphies with other members of that family. The trichobothrial pattern and the structure of the tarsi represent synapomorphies between Lisposoma and the Bothriuridae. Lisposoma contains two species, both from Namibia, which represent the bothriurids in southern Africa.

N2  - A study was made of visual epigamic displays in representative species of North American jumping spiders, with a special emphasis on determining the value of using such displays in systematics. Several presumed homologies in courtship behavior were described which largely support the most recent subfamilial arrangement on morphology. Courtship was found to be of more use in some generic and specific level problems, especially with closely related sympatric species. Agonistic displays were found to be of less use in systematics than courtship, because of the similar ways in which males engage in combat display, even in distantly related genera.

N2  - The responses of five tropical orb-weaving spiders (family Araneidae and Uloboridae) to predatory attacks by salticids and hummingbirds were observed. Responses varied between species and predators. Salticid attacks dorsal to orb-weavers on the web evoked rapid movements which displaced the salticid from the orb-weaver's dorsum. Ventral salticid attacks were countered by stilting. Attacks by hummingbirds evoked dropping or retreat from the web surface. Uloborus republicanus (Simon) without eggmasses dropped more frequently than U. republicanus with eggmasses when attacked by hummingbirds. Cyclosa caroli (Hentz) did not respond to hummingbird attacks directed toward the debris-like stabilimentum; however, salticid spider contacts on the Cyclosa or stabilimentum evoked active defense.

N2  - Direct observation of colony behavior indicated that individual Mallos gregalis spiders exhibited a change in behavior related to activity level and position in the web. High-activity M. gregalis were found on the surface of the web while low-activity animals were found in the web interior. Individuals move to the web surface in the evening and into the web interior at midday. The activity of the colony was recorded through photoelectric means and was circadian with the highest level of activity occurring at night, the lowest level occurring about midday. The circadian rhythmicity was maintained in isolated M. gregalis and activity was recorded by similar photoelectric means. The data indicate that isolates fluctuated between high and low activity levels over several days. I suggested that such changes in individual activity level allow each animal to partition its behavior between self-maintenance and colony-maintenance behaviors.

N2  - Although the theridiid spider Argyrodes trigonum has been described as a commensal, it has been found eating its host. In central Maryland A. trigonum often inhabits the web of the labyrinth spider, Metepeira labyrinthea. I performed a field experiment to assess the possible impact of A. trigonum upon labyrinth spider populations. Replicated groups of M. labyrinthea were established on four open experimental units in the species' natural habitat. Each unit was a wood frame supporting wire fencing on which the spiders built their webs. Mature A. trigonum females were added to two of the units and numbers of the labyrinth spider were monitored for 18 days. Numbers of M. labyrinthea declined more rapidly on the units to which A. trigonum had been introduced. More dead labyrinth spiders were found in these populations, and indirect evidence suggests that losses from emigration may have been higher in the presence of A. trigonum. Labelling A. trigonum as a commensal is probably misleading.

N2  - Trechalea magnifica (Pisauridae) inhabit small streams in Costa Rica. Except for a few juveniles, these spiders were always active at night. This nocturnal activity may be due to temporal changes in predation risk and food availability. Predation risk was lower at night, whereas food was more abundant during the day. The diet of this species includes freshwater shrimp, a prey item previously unreported for spiders. These spiders construct hemispherical egg cases and carry them to their spinnerets: characteristics atypical of the family Pisauridae.

Two synonymies are proposed: Gluvia martha Karsch 1879 = Ammotrechella geniculata (C. L. Koch 1842) and Ammotrechula vogli Roewer 1952 = Ammotrechella geniculata (C. L.

N2  - Four female D. bigbendensis gave birth in the laboratory. One parturition was normal and some of the young were reared to maturity, whereas the other three parturitions were abnormal and resulted in significant cannibalism of the newborn by their mothers. In the normal parturition 37 young were born during about 30 hours. The young emerged tail-first and upside-down, and were free of any &quot;birth membranes.&quot; It is hypothesized that the tail-first em&#232;rgence of the young is directly related to the katoikogenic type of embryonic development (in embryonic diverticula) that these scorpions undergo. The average birth lasted 6.9 &#177; 4.0 minutes, and the average interval between consecutive births was 44.4 &#177; 30.8 minutes. The relatively large standard deviation is due to the emergence of the young mostly in pairs separated by considerably longer intervals between pairs. It is hypothesized that the paired births are related to the bilateral symmetry of the female reproductive system.

N2  - Effects of leaf shape and other habitat structure variables on spider community organization and on microhabitat selection of immature Enoplognatha ovata in deciduous forest litter were studied in central New York. Three litter boxes of each of four litter treatments (curled maple leaves, flat maple leaves, curled filter paper disks, and flat filter paper disks) were sampled monthly from November 1979 to August 1980. Twelve similarly-sized samples of natural litter also were collected, and all litter boxes and natural litter samples were placed in Tullgren funnels for extraction of spiders. Spider species richness was significantly greater in curled litter than in flat litter. Significant differences in the composition of hunting spider families also were found. Differences in species richness and composition of hunting spiders was attributed to differences in habitat space, according to leaf shape. Each litter treatment supported approximately the same proportion of hunting and web-building spiders and s...

It is shown here, however, that the jumping spider Trite planiceps readily seizes live house flies in the dark, and that such behaviour is probably accomplished by means of vibratory signals.

N2  - Members of Hyptiotes cavatus construct vertical triangle-webs, consisting of only four radii spanned by capture threads. Spiderlings began constructing triangle capture webs only as third instars. In the laboratory male and female development was synchronous, most individuals maturing as sixth instars, at which time males ceased constructing capture webs. Capture webs were usually constructed only during the first sixty percent of a developmental stadium. Males and females reared in large containers produced more webs during and spent more time in the fifth stadium than those reared in small containers with more closely spaced supports. Development and web production of earlier instars were not significantly influenced by container size.

Males mature at either the sixth or the seventh instar and experience no postmaturation molts. &quot;Small&quot; males reach adulthood at the age of 235.7 &#177; 14.8 days (n = 14), whereas &quot;large&quot; males require 281.8 &#177; 10.7 days (n = 19). Large males are approximately 1.25 times bigger than small males in the lengths of six structures measured (carapace, femur, tibia, chela, metasomal segment V, and telson), and produce spermatophores that differ by the same ratio from those of small males. Growth rates are discussed with respect to sexual dimorphism, and the instar at which maturity is reached. Attaining maturity at different instars appears to be a common life history strategy among buthid scorpions: in some species males mature at different instars, in others females do, and in still others both sexes are variable.

N2  - Male conspecifics and congeners were attracted to screened enclosures containing female Argiope trifasciata and Araneus trifolium. Male Argiope aurantia were found on cages containing female A. trifasciata which matured earlier than wild conspecifics. Males tended to aggregate on the downwind side of cages. This evidence supports the presence of an airborne sex pheromone emitted by females of these two species of orbweavers. The use of male-attractant pheromones should produce different mating strategies than expected from random search by males. High density and clumping of females may affect reproductive success and mate competition by generating stronger signals than those of isolated females.

N2  - The species of spiders from a cotton field agroecosystem were identified and their presence, abundance and distribution on the plant was determined. Ninety-seven species were found, with seven species comprising half of the total number collected. Oxyopes salticus Hentz was the most abundant, 23% of all spiders collected. More species of orb weavers than of other spiders were found in the middle of the plant than elsewhere. Spiders that spin irregular webs were also found more often in the mid plant area but also were found all over the plant. Ambushing spiders were found mostly in the top of the plant and hunting spiders were found most often in pitfall traps. Web spinners were apparently more abundant than hunters during a cool, wet year while hunters appeared to be more abundant in a hot and dry year.

N2  - The external morphology and life history of Microbisium confusum Hoff completes the description of this species which was described by Hoff (1946) on the basis of 127 &quot;adult&quot; individuals. All instars are illustrated and described with special reference to chaetotaxy. Males, not collected in the quantitative life history study, were obtained from several localities. The life history was based on quantitative sampling in a northern New York beech-maple woodlot over 2 years. Protonymphs and females were collected throughout the winter months under snow cover. Deutonymphs probably overwintered but were collected less frequently. There was no evidence that more than one generation was produced each year; however, females might reproduce in successive years.

N2  - A total of 83 species of spiders were collected from the shrub, herb and ground strata of a sagebrush steppe in northern Utah. Dominant families (Thomisidae, Philodromidae, Salticidae) and, in some cases, genera (Misumenops, Philodromus) or species [Sassacus papenhoei (Peckham and Peckham)] were similar to those found in other studies of shrub-dominated areas. Among the spiders of this community, ambushing and wandering were more common foraging strategies than was webspinning. Habitat separation in sagebrush steppe spiders was more vertical than horizontal. Shrub and herb spider species assemblage differed sharply from the ground spider species assemblage, less so from one another. Differences in vegetation density, diversity and size among four study plots correlated positively with spider abundance and diversity, but resulted in less difference among spider assemblages. Temporal patterns of spider abundance differed among strata. Seasonal patterns showed evidence of being influenced by climate and migr...

N2  - The biology of Octonoba octonarius (Muma) was studied over a two year period of laboratory rearing and field observations. Under laboratory conditions the spider matured as a fifth or sixth instar. First nymphal instars still in the egg sac fed upon unecloded eggs and second prelarvae. Web construction and nutritive behaviors followed patterns recorded in the Uloboridae. Courtship and mating patterns differed from others of the family in that typically two serial copulations were followed by immediate sperm induction and two additional brief copulations. A chalcid, Arachnopteromalus dasys Gordh, newly described from specimens found in this study, whose larva is an egg predator, Achaearanea tepidariorum (C. L. Koch), and man's activities were the principal ecological pressures on O. octonarius populations.

N2  - Male Dolomedes triton perform announcement displays consisting of leg-waving and jerks in response to water that has contacted the integument of female conspecifics. Jerks cause bursts of concentric surface waves that probably provide a signal for the female. Males also follow the female's dragline, using a lycosid-like manner on land but switching to rowing and pulling when the line is on water. When close enough to touch the female, the male performs a courtship display consisting of rapid leg tapping, which, with the female's leg-waving, results in prolonged leg interplay between the sexes.

N2  - Xysticus emertoni Keyserling (Araneae: thomisidae) hunted regularly for insects on flowers of common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca L.), but only infrequently on goldenrod (Solidago juncea Ait.) and rarely on pasture rose (Rosa carolina L.) Individuals usually remained less than two days on a milkweed stem and fed primarily on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) and nocturnal noctuid and geometrid moths. The largest common prey, bumble bees (Bombus spp.) were very seldom captured. Misumena vatia (Clerck), a second species of thomisid that hunted on flowers in the study area, by contrast hunted frequently on milkweed, goldenrod, and pasture rose. Individuals remained over twice as long on milkweeds and captured bumble bees regularly, as well as honey bees and nocturnal moths. As a consequence, they captured over twice as much prey biomass per day as Xysticus. I hypothesize that the difference between the two species in time spent per stem and in frequency of using goldenrod and pasture rose is a consequence of the...

N2  - Paruroctonus Werner consists of two sympatric subgenera, the nominate and Smeringurus, new subgenus. Smeringurus is defined by the presence of numerous short setae on the ventral intercarinal surfaces of metasomal segments I-IV, and by having a significantly more slender metasoma. Smeringurus consists of four species endemic to the southwestern deserts of North America: P vachoni Stahnke (type species), P. mesaensis Stahnke, P. grandis (Williams), and P. aridus Soleglad. Two subspecies of P. vachoni are defined by the numbers of primary denticles on the grasping edge of the pedipalp fingers: P. v. vachoni, from the northern Mojave Desert region, and P. v. immanis Soleglad, new combination, from the central and southern Mojave Desert and the Colorado Desert. Paruroctonus vachoni, P, grandis and P. aridus are allopatric, occupying rocky substrates; each occurs sympatrically with P. mesaensis, a psammophilous species.

N2  - In order to determine the extent to which differences in web structure are correlated with divergence in diet, we collected and identified prey from the webs of two syntopic orb-weavers whose webs differ markedly in architecture. The species studied were the basilica spider Mecynogea lemniscata, and the labyrinth spider Metepeira labyrinthea. Two nearby allotopic populations were also compared. We determined the size and taxonomic category of the prey of both species, web height, and the type of vegetation supporting the web. The diets of syntopic populations were very similar. No statistically significant differences were found between syntopic Mecynogea and Metepeira in either the types or size of prey collected from the webs. Allotopic populations differed in these aspects of the diet, but the overlap was substantial. Metepeira usually placed its web higher and on less rigid vegetation than did Mecynogea. However, the overlap was extensive, particularly when the species occurred together. Syntopic basi...

N2  - Ballooning, a form of dispersal rarely seen in mygalomorph spiders, was observed one early spring day in about 30 Sphodros spiderlings. After ascending a stump, each spiderling became airborne by dropping and hanging from a dragline which then gradually lifted and lengthened in the breeze, broke at its attachment point, and served as the ballooning thread. Although less effective than the aerial dispersal mechanisms of many araneomorph spiders, this technique can nevertheless produce higher and longer flights than Bristowe and others have suspected.

N2  - Direct observations of the wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata (Walckenaer) in a deciduous woods during its breeding season indicated that soil moisture, deciduous leaf litter, and herbaceous vegetation influenced the patterns of their distribution and movement. Areas of high soil moisture, non-compressed litter, and a micro-canopy of herbaceous vegetation comprised the microhabitat with highest spider density. Spiders tended to travel greater distances in the drier patches, suggesting that the increased level of locomotion was related to increased searching for favorable environments. S. ocreata was found to aggregate at a litter patch size of 625 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This lycosid appeared to employ a sit-and-wait foraging strategy based on the relationships of spider movement and microhabitat selection. A sex ratio of 1:1 differed from those previously obtained by pitfall trapping methods. Movement and distance information from direct observations of spiders provided support to the previous hypothesis of greater ...

N2  - The silk produced by the spider contributes not only to the security of the individual (dragline, retreat, eggsac) and to capture prey (snare) but also plays a role in the exchange of information between individuals. The structured silk constitutes a network favorable to the transmission of vibratory phenomena but a single silk thread can also inform a spider of the presence of a conspecific and of its sexual identity through tactochemical cues. A number of authors have shown, namely in Lycosidae, that the substratum of the female's silk with which a pheromone is associated, triggers off the courtship of the male. Moreover, an individual coming across a dragline can orientate its locomotion according to the identity of the spider which emitted the thread. Results obtained with Tegenaria domestica and T. pagana, in a T-maze, show that specific female sexual factors associated with the silk enable the male to orient its movements. The nature of these factors has not yet been determined. It is probably a phe...

N2  - Frontinella pyramitela, the Bowl and Doily Spider, and Neriene radiata, the Filmy Dome Spider, were the two most common linyphiid species in a study of sheetweb weaving and orbweaving guilds in central New Jersey. They differ in size when adult and in the relationship between prey size and spider size, but not in the absolute size of prey taken nor in their tendency to move from websites. Competition for websites is a negligible factor in the system, although the populations may be food-limited. These results are compared with studies by Wise (1975) and Riechert (1976, 1978, 1981).

N2  - Clubiona cambridgei is a vagrant hunting spider that oviposits in silken nests and remains with its eggs. Conspecifics were observed in the field feeding on unattended eggs, an unusual prey for a spider. In the laboratory conspecifics readily ate unattended eggs, but attended eggs were successfully guarded against predation by the resident. This implicates intraspecific egg predation as an important factor favoring maternal females that remain with their eggs. Although &quot;egg guarding&quot; is a label commonly applied when spiders remain with their eggs after oviposition, this is one of the few cases in which the adaptive significance of this behavior has been investigated.

N2  - After measuring their initial weights, we induced first instar larvae of Mantispa uhleri Banks to board individual Salticus scenicus (Clerck) adults and immatures. After varying periods of time (2 to 73 days), larvae were removed from their spiders and reweighed. Changes in larval weight were analyzed by multiple linear regression. Results demonstrate that larvae increase in weight in proportion to their tenure on a spider. Because of this we suggest that larvae are maintaining themselves by feeding on spider blood. The significance of initial weight in accounting for variation in weight change suggests that there may be an optimal maintenance weight range for larvae while on a spider.

N2  - The limb-beating sampling method was evaluated with regard to its seasonal efficiency and the effects of the time of day of sampling. The efficiency of limb-beating was generally high throughout the season with averages of 88%, 90%, and 85% for the Salticidae, web-builder (Theridiidae and Dictynidae), and total spiders, respectively. The overall seasonal efficiency of limb-beating for the Thomisidae (includes Philodromidae) was lower (79%) due to the inefficiency in sampling early instar Philodromus sp. spiderlings during one sampling date. There were no significant differences (p &gt; 0.05) due to time of day of sampling on population estimates obtained for the Salticidae, Thomisidae, web-builders, and total spiders during normal sampling hours of 9:00-18:00. On one of two sampling dates, more nocturnally active clubionids were collected at 3:00 than most other sample periods.

N2  - Observations of 22 orb-weaving species of the family Uloboridae show that these spiders assume one of four basic resting postures as they hang beneath the web's hub. The primitive pattern found in Tangaroa and Octonoba is characterized by all legs being spread and about equally flexed, whereas in Zosis the protracted first legs grasp the web at nearly the same point. Uloborus species typically assume a more cryptic posture characterized by acutely protracted and flexed first legs. Dense setal tufts proximal to the abruptly flexed leg segment provide outline camouflage and conceal the extended, shorter second legs which no longer support the body. In contrast, Philoponella species lack leg tufts and assume a compact posture with first legs folded against the sternum and only the last three pairs of legs grasping the web. The significance of these findings for uloborid classification and phylogeny is discussed.

These character states support Gertsch's (1958) idea linking the family with Plectreuridae between the Dysderoidea and Scytodoidea.

N2  - A suspected allometric relationship between chelicera length and body size in male Zygoballus rufipes was investigated. In order to minimize possible effects of geographic variation, all specimens available (24 males, 46 females) from a circumscribed area in south-central Michigan were studied. Power curve regressions of carapace width, carapace height, chelicera length, palp length, first leg length, and second leg length on a general measure of body size (carapace length) were calculated for each sex. The allometric relationship was expressed as Y = b &lt;tex-math&gt;${\rm X^{{\rm k}}}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;. In females all body measurements varied isometrically (linearly) with respect to carapace length (k = 0.91 - 1.04).

A fairly narrow intermediate zone is found where the yellow and black legged morphs meet. A similar zone is present at the parapatric interface between P. villosus and P. brachystylus. Using multivariate morphometrics the morphological variation was found to be insignificant between the color morphs, but intermediates between P. villosus and P. brachystylus show morphology in-between that of the presumed parental forms. Factors that may be involved in the maintenance of the step lines are also suggested. Finally, P. brachystylus is given subspecific status.

N2  - We observed the sequences of behaviors shown during encounters between individuals in conspecifically and heterospecifically grouped adult female Lycosa punctulata, L. rabida, and L. helluo. Significant linkages within pairs of successive acts between individuals were revealed, indicating that some behaviors have communicatory effects. There were no major differences among the three species in the forms of behaviors shown, nor in the sequences of these behaviors, the sequences being highly variable. Some of the behaviors, and perhaps their sequence variability, probably inhibit approach and/or attack, thus resulting in spacing of the individuals. Cannibalism was infrequent (&lt; 1%) within conspecific as well as heterospecific groups. Food deprivation did not increase cannibalism within conspecific groups of post-mating age females, suggesting either that hunger does not increase the level of aggressivity among conspecific females of this physiological class, or that hunger lowers their fighting potential an...

A total of 146 scorpions was captured in 3735 trap nights. Paruroctonus utahensis was the dominant species in flat grassland habitat (62-72% of captures). Vaejovis coahuilae and V. russelli were both found in the flat grassland habitat, but in lower numbers than P. utahensis. The two Vaejovis species were common in rocky cliff habitat (V. coahuilae 61%, V. russelli 37%) but P. utahensis was rare on the cliff (2% of captures). Paruroctonus may be unable to occupy the rocky cliff because it lacks suitable soil for burrowing.

N2  - Life history studies on scorpions have taken various approaches. The theoretical method uses a progression factor of 1.26 in linear dimensions at each molt to predict the number of molts required by young scorpions of known instar to reach adult size. The direct empirical approach consists of raising scorpions to maturity in captivity. The indirect approach is based on morphometric analyses of field caught samples, and assumes that discrete size classes can be recognized and interpreted as representing the various instars. The mixed approach uses extrapolation to predict maturity from the results of a partial life history. The reliability of the various approaches is evaluated (a) by analyzing the life history of Vaejovis coahuilae Williams, and (b) by reviewing the results of all prior life history studies on scorpions.

N2  - The primitive function of spider silk is commonly thought to have been associated with any of three typical behavior patterns seen in the bulk of spiders today: (1) egg protection, (2) prey capture, and (3) shelter building. It is argued here that a primitive function in egg protection and prey capture must be regarded as very unlikely. Silk production and application is hypothesized to have originated in relation to shelter building and burrowing habits of ancestral spiders then still living in a littoral environment.

N2  - A population of Argiope aurantia Lucas was sampled through a growing season in a swamp habitat of the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, South Carolina. Observations and physical data showed that immature females increased web area dramatically as the male population began to reach maturity. This change in web area paralleled a change in diet composition from smaller zygopterans to larger bodied libellulid dragonflies. A second shift in diet to pollinating Apidae occurred as females were initiating egg case production and was associated with blooming of smartweed (Polygonum punctatum) in the habitat.

N2  - The courtship of bowl-and doily spiders (Frontinella pyramitela) is both prolonged and elaborate. Our analyses of videotaped courtships reveal patterns that are species typical with respect to overall temporal sequence and event dominance (in frequency and duration of individual behaviors). Transition matrices, also derived from videotape analyses, indicate that the pre-mount phase of courtship involves stochastic cycling among six distinct behaviors. Though the timing of the transition to the mount phase of courtship is crudely predictable, no single courtship behavior precedes the mount phase more frequently than is expected by chance. Many of the behaviors visible during courtship produce web-borne vibrations that affect the motion (and the behavior) of the recipient spider. Descriptions of the motions of the vibration effectors and of the web-borne vibrations that mediate Frontinella courtship are presented. Based on our analyses of the vibratory signals and of the patterns evident in courtship, we co...

N2  - The orb web of Nephila clavipes has been fractionated into a water soluble and water insoluble fraction. The former contained K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (1.8%), Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (0.5%), and ninhydrin reactive amines (20.6%) of the original web weight. The ninhydrin reactive amines were mainly glycine and a gamma-aminobutyric acid related compound. The water insoluble fraction (fibroin) was digested with trypsin into a soluble and insoluble fraction. Amino acid analysis suggested that the trypsin insoluble fraction derived from the large ampullate gland and thus represents the radial fibers and hub spiral. These observations are compared to those previously made for Argiope aurantia and Argiope trifasciata.

N2  - In South Australia Clubiona are predominantly found under the bark of Eucalyptus trees, especially E. viminalis and E. leucoxylon. C. robusta, the largest of four coexisting species at this location matures in 10 instars (females), males in seven to nine instars. Males reared in the laboratory are smaller than those collected in the field. C. cycladata matures in five or six instars. C. robusta constructs two types of silk retreats; nests and moulting chambers. Nests have thicker silk walls and provide sites for females to overwinter, mate, lay and guard their eggs. Measurements of temperature and humidity in nests during summer indicate that they provide more favourable conditions and probably reduce the likelihood of desiccation to the resident spider, eggs and juveniles. Moulting chambers are constructed by juvenile instars as sites for moulting. C. cycladata constructs thin-walled nests that resemble the moulting chambers of C. robusta. Females of all species lay one or two egg masses per season. Eggs...

N2  - Cluster analyses of 51 quantified carapace features from each of 34 species representing all known uloborid genera fail to produce a consistent pattern of overall similarity. However, a minimum spanning tree and a principal axis analysis of these features shows that formation of PLE tubercles and other anterior lateral carapace changes are most responsible for explaining carapace diversity within the Uloboridae. Many of these same features are shown by discriminant analysis to be most highly correlated with web type, indicating that they are functionally linked to changes in web monitoring and use. A survey of the endosternites of Hyptiotes, Miagrammopes, and Philoponella, and carapace musculature of the latter two genera shows many changes in carapace form to be associated with muscle reorientation that facilitates use of a reduced orb-web. The presence of eye tubercles associated with the most extremely modified carapaces also appears to ventrally extend the spider's vision.

N2  - In the forested mountain areas of southwestern Canada, Leiobunum paessleri (Roewer) form overwintering aggregations in the twilight regions of moist caves and mines. Each aggregation consists of adults of both sexes and may contain as many as one or two thousand individuals. The opilionids congregate from August to October and disperse from April to May. Colder temperatures seem to increase the density of the aggregations. When dense aggregations are formed (up to 2.6 individuals per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the opilionids hang by their pedipalps with their legs extended straight down from their bodies. Explanations of the aggregation phenomenon include: optimal temperatures and humidities, reduced desiccation, heat production, increased mating success, and reduced predation. Overwintering mortality factors potentially include cold, desiccation, starvation, predation and disease.

N2  - Individuals of Schizocosa mccooki (Montgomery) are found in open areas of pinyon-juniper woodland in New Mexico. They co-occur with individuals of Alopecosa kochi (Keyserling) and Lycosa coloradensis Banks. Individuals of S. mccooki overwinter as immatures. They then mature in May, and mating occurs in May and June. During courtship, a male S. mccooki will make a quick jump, assume a position facing the female, and perform a series of palpal movements. The pattern of sound production includes a series of 2-18 bursts of percussion, with each burst consisting of 2-4 individual taps of the palps. The sounds produced from a courtship sequence of two individuals from Saskatchewan, Canada, were very similar to the sounds produced by the individuals from New Mexico.

This genus is a sister group of Hyptiotes and is characterized by construction of a single-line web, loss of the anterior eyes, a carapace with lateral apodemes and flexible anterior margins, a divided sternum, and a male palpus with a radix that has taken over the conductor's function. Cladistic analysis divides Miagrammopes into eight species groups that do not correspond to previous genera. Major patterns of diversity result from differences in eye and lateral apodeme position, thoracic region and abdominal lengths, and sternum width.

Tityus antillanus (Thorell, 1877), originally described from two juveniles from the &quot;Antilles,&quot; is a junior synonym of T. crassimanus. Tityus crassimanus appears to be most closely related to Tityus michelii Armas, from Puerto Rico. Tityus obtusus (Karsch, 1879), from Puerto Rico, has been confused with, and erroneously suspected of being a junior synonym of T. crassimanus.

N2  - Feeding by winter-active and winter-inactive species of spiders at low temperatures and the kinds of invertebrate prey eaten were determined. Winter-active spiders fed at 2&#176;C, less often at -2&#176;C and rarely at -5&#176;C, whereas winter-inactive species displayed even more reduced feeding or none. All prey offered to the spiders were eaten except nabids, hymenopterans and the collembolan Onychiurus pseudoarmatus. In general, small spiders consumed small prey and larger spiders larger prey. Some scavenging was seen in large female spiders. The most probable prey of winter-active spiders are the winter-active collembolans, all of which inhabit the subnivean space and litter during winter.

N2  - The crab spider Misumena vatia, a sit-and-wait predator commonly found on flowers, did not specialize on prey, although the commonest prey (bumble bees Bombus spp. and tiny syrphid flies Toxomerus marginatus) on pasture rose differed so greatly in size that specialization was predicted. On milkweed the commonest prey (bumble bees and honey bees Apis mellifera) were more similar in size, and the predicted generalist strategy was observed. Spiders on milkweed inflorescences usually selected the best hunting sites, but not all did so, as predicted. The sites chosen best match the frequency of prey visits to inflorescences of differing quality. Spiders on good stems moved more frequently than those on poor stems; however, their success was extremely variable.

N2  - A Mecynogea lemniscata (Walck.) female with egg sacs removes her orb web by breaking the peripheral anchoring threads and the upper and lower guying threads attached to the surrounding labyrinth. The collapsed web then loosely surrounds the egg sac string which hangs above the open hub of the formerly intact web. Repeated trips by the spider around this fluffy mass tightly wraps it around the egg sac string. The collapsed orb then becomes an additional layer of silk added to the covering of the egg sacs and thus contributes to the survival success of the eggs and young in their exposed position. This previously unknown secondary use of the destroyed orb is a third alternative to two well-known fates, i.e. whether it is ingested or discarded.

I evaluated the impact of predation by A. fissifrons upon the host population in a woody field in Nagoya, Japan. A. fissifrons occurred on more than 75% of the host webs, but the percentage of hosts preyed upon by A. fissifrons was not high: 2% at the second molting, 3% at the third molting, 1% at the fourth molting, 4% at the fifth molting, 0% at the sixth molting, 8% at the seventh (final) molting. A. fissifrons preferentially preyed upon the host individuals whose development was delayed.

N2  - Field experiments were conducted to uncover the effects of a web-invading spider, Argyrodes trigonum (Hentz), on two spider species that serve as its host, Neriene radiata (Walckenaer) and Metepeira labyrinthea (Walckenaer). A series of short-term experiments, each lasting one to three days, investigated (1) the effect of host-Argyrodes size differentials on the rate of host emigration and mortality, (2) the effect of additional food on host and Argyrodes emigration, (3) the rate of immigration to, and emigration from, host-occupied and host-unoccupied webs by Argyrodes, and (4) the use of host webs by Argyrodes. The presence of Argyrodes resulted in significant host emigration when host-Argyrodes weight ratios were below 10:1. In some invasions Argyrodes killed the resident spider. Additional prey did not prevent the host from leaving webs containing adult Argyrodes, nor did added prey affect Argyrodes emigration from webs.

N2  - Among web-building spiders, bowl and doily spiders (Frontinella pyramitela) are unusual because adult males feed frequently. The males rarely build webs, however, and so depend upon females' snares for foraging. In field and laboratory experiments I assessed the impact of male competition on female foraging success and growth rate. During periods when males are abundant, a female is likely to have a male on her web 22% of the time. These cohabiting males capture about 32% of the prey that hit the web despite the female's efforts to capture the same prey. As a result, males decrease female foraging success by about 7% during periods of male abundance. Adult females grow at a rate that increases linearly with increased food consumption-thus the presence of cohabiting males causes a corresponding 7% decrease in female growth rate when males are abundant. The literature on spider foraging and fecundity permits us to calculate that the resultant impact on female fecundity is between 6.1% and 7.0% depending upo...

N2  - Females of the species, Nephila clavipes (L.), sometimes build their webs in interconnected clusters. Aggregations in a Peruvian population of this spider were located in areas of high insect activity. This locale enabled individuals in aggregations to capture more prey than solitary individuals. Experiments with prey removal and prey supplementation verified that a high prey capture rate was essential in maintaining such groups. Agonistic interactions frequently preceded departure of a spider from a cluster. These data imply that high prey availability is a prerequisite for the evolution of more complex sociality in Nephila and other similar spider species.

N2  - This study of nomadic riparian ground-surface inhabiting spiders was made at the Los Alamos National Environmental Park, Mew Mexico. Spiders constituted about 10% of this mixed coniferous forest community. They were widely distributed in all samples, as the frequency of occurrence was high (mean for year was 85%). The mean relative densities of spiders, however, was low, ranging from less than 2% in winter to about 15% in summer. There is a seasonal shift of relative densities indicating that this population of carnivores may increase proportionately faster than its prey from winter to summer. Actual numbers of spiders trapped seasonally ranged from 102 individuals at all sites in late winter to over ten times as many (1140) in early summer. This mean number of species per season per site ranged from eight in winter to nearly 22 in early summer.

A literature review shows that nematode parasitism of arachnids is worldwide and at least 51 species of spiders and harvestmen have been recorded as hosts of mermithid nematodes. Infected spiders have varied habits and it is postulated that two types of parasite life cycles probably exist and that the indirect life cycle (involving a paratenic host which falls prey to the arachnid) is probably the common type.

N2  - Agelenopsis aperta (Gertsch) inhabits desert grasslands and lava beds in the southwestern U.S.A. The capacity of this species to cold-harden was assessed by exposing second generation laboratory-reared specimens to an artificial low temperature cycle simulating the &quot;summer-autumn-winter&quot; transition. Low temperature acclimation had no effect on whole body supercooling points, freeze tolerance or rates of oxygen consumption. Elevated levels of cryoprotectants were not detected using high performance liquid chromatographic techniques. Cold tolerance was similar between males, females and immatures. Exposure to temperatures immediately above the whole body supercooling point caused no apparent injury. It is hypothesized that movement into protected overwintering microhabitats may obviate the necessity for the evolution of seasonal mechanisms of cold-hardening in A. aperta.

N2  - A systematic revision of the family Sternophoridae is presented. Three genera are recognized: Garyops Banks, Idiogaryops Hoff and Afrosternophorus Beier; the latter is given full generic status. These genera are distinguished solely on the female genitalia. The following generic synonymies are proposed (junior synonym first): Sternophorus Chamberlin = Garyops; Sternophorellus Beier = Afrosternophorus; Indogaryops Sivaraman = Afrosternophorus. The following species are synonymized with A. ceylonicus (Beier): Sternophorus transiens Murthy and Ananthakrishnan, S. indicus Murthy and Ananthakrishnan, S. montanus Sivaraman, S. femoratus Sivaraman, S. intermedius Sivaraman and Indogaryops amrithiensis Sivaraman. Four new species are proposed: Afrosternophorus anabates (Australia), A. fallax (Vietnam), A. nanus (Australia) and A. xalyx (Australia). Garyops contains depressus Banks, sini (Chamberlin), centralis Beier and, possibly, ferrisi (Chamberlin). Idiogaryops consists of paludis (Chamberlin) and pumilus (Hof...

N2  - Size-frequency histograms and other data generated from four samples (totaling 926 specimens) collected during a complete year show that a Hypochilus population in the Great Smoky Mountains has a two-year life cycle with the following schedule: spiderlings emerge from egg sacs and construct their first webs in late May; 15 to 18 months later, during their second autumn, these spiders mature, mate, and lay eggs. The growth rate and adult body size variances of this population are very large. The coefficients of variation of three palpal dimensions in a sample of 38 males are significantly smaller than those of tibia I length or carapace length. Such relative constancy of palpal characters within a population may be common in spiders and may result from stabilizing selection in one or both of the following forms: selection for the mechanical compatibility necessary for effective sperm placement during copulation, and sexual selection by female choice.

N2  - Most empirical studies of spider ballooning use sticky traps to sample the aeronaut fauna. Once the animals are removed from the adhesive and passed through solvents into preservative, biologically meaningful masses cannot be determined directly. We use simple linear regressions to describe relationships between live masses of wild-caught animals and a volume estimate which treats the spider as a cylindrical solid with diameter equal to the mean of greatest carapace and abdomen width and height equal to total length. Of regressions for six families studied in detail, the slope for tetragnathids differs significantly from those for all but one of the other five. Pair-wise comparisons of slopes for the five non-tetragnathid families show no statistically significant differences. We therefore present two linear regression equations, one for tetragnathids and other similar-shaped spiders, and the other for &quot;typical&quot; (all other) spiders. Limited data from one species each of pisaurid and linyphiid are statisti...

N2  - The predatory behavior of the spitting spider Scytodes sp. was studied in the laboratory, and an ethogram of the predatory behavior was developed. The principal components usually occur in the order: tapping, spitting, biting, wrapping, feeding. Spitting results in a pair of sticky, zig-zag, transverse bands which pin the prey to the substrate. At the capture site scytodids wrap the prey using the typical form seen in the &quot;higher&quot; spiders: the spider holds the prey in both third legs and alternates the use of right and left fourth legs in applying silk. Prey are eaten at the capture site. A comparison of prey wrapping by spiders in primitive aerial-web building species with that used by typically &quot;vagrant&quot; species which forage on elevated substrates shows two very different forms of prey wrapping. We argue that prey wrapping at the capture site is an early adaptation of spider radiation into the aerial niche based on the presence of one form or the other in most taxa foraging above ground. Further, the ex...

Young scorpions up to 6 cm in length stung nearly all prey items. At 10 cm in length these scorpions stung only large, violently struggling prey items. Adult scorpions never used the sting, dispatching prey with the pedipalps and apparently refusing prey too large to subdue with the pedipalps alone. Prey capture behavior in P. imperator is compared with other species and the possible survival values of sting use is discussed.

N2  - The masses of Sphodros atlanticus and Ummidia sp. spiderlings capable of ballooning, and of Antrodiaetus unicolor spiderlings believed not to balloon, were estimated by means of a volume-mass regression developed with data from five araneomorph families, and compared with the mass frequency distribution of a sample of 216 aerially dispersing araneomorphs trapped over a one week period in a soybean field. Mean estimated masses of the Sphodros and Ummidia spiderlings were 1.25 mg and 3.45 mg, respectively. Although these were in at least the 95th percentile of masses of the trapped araneomorphs, larger araneomorphs were trapped. These results and the finding that A. unicolor spiderlings were intermediate in estimated mass (mean = 2.02 mg) between S. atlanticus and Ummidia, indicate that mass is not the only constraint on ballooning behavior in mygalomorphs. Habitats of the three species support the habitat predictability hypothesis of ballooning, A. unicolor tending to be found in more predictable habitats ...

Representatives of all four hosts were killed by the above nematodes. In Pholcus, Pirata and Latrodectus, the nematodes developed to the adult stage but did not multiply. In the case of Phalangium, the nematodes reproduced and formed infective juveniles. The present report establishes that under ideal conditions, neoaplectanid and heterorhabditid nematodes are capable of infecting, killing and with one host, reproducing in arachnids.

N2  - In vitro radiotracer studies using tritiated leucine revealed that C. sculpturatus embryos accumulated leucine by a process that is characterized by a rate constant of approximately 0.02 min&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Cyanide inhibits leucine uptake, indicating that active transport is probably involved. Leucine is incorporated into embryonic proteins, and uptake is more rapid during early developmental stages when growth is most rapid. Although leucine uptake continues throughout development, dry mass of embryos does not increase during the later stages. These stages are characterized by differentiation, maturation, and by accumulation of water. Total body water increases from 53% of body mass in embryos with unpigmented median eyes to more than 80% at birth.

N2  - Overwintering success of the filmy dome spider Prolinyphia marginata (Koch) [= Neriene radiata (Walckenaer) and Linyphia marginata Koch] was observed with respect to stage of development and differences in body weight within a stage. Studies conducted in three different areas measured winter survivorship rates of 60 spiders housed in outdoor cages (Michigan), 243 spiders in outdoor jars (Maryland), and 245 spiders in a combination of cages and jars (New York). The overall proportion of spiders successfully overwintering was 0.31 in New York, 0.69 in Maryland, and 0.75 in Michigan. All three studies showed that older stages (instars) had substantially higher survival rates than younger stages. Comparison between the autumn weights of overwintering survivors and non-survivors indicated that differences in spider weight within a stage had no significant influence on winter survival. These experimental studies suggest that overwintering mortality may be significant in natural populations of P. marginata, and ...

N2  - Philoponella republicana (Araneae, Uloboridae) is a communal orb-weaving spider. Colonies of this spider were found more frequently in interface forest than in high forest or mountain savannah forest. This does not appear to be due to differences in insect abundance among forest types, but is correlated with greater complexity of the understory in the interface forest. This may be due to the need for supports for colony attachment lines. Within the interface forest, the location of colonies is correlated with local insect abundance. When flying insects are excluded from colonies, individual spiders can respond by increasing the distance between orbs in the colony, and colonies can respond by abandoning the site and moving to a new location.

N2  - Data collected on life history traits of Peucetia viridans, representing three generations, were analyzed. A total of 61 females and their clutches were examined to determine the following: female mass, female tibia length, clutch mass, clutch size, mean mass per young, egg sac mass, egg sac mass per young, and relative clutch mass (an estimate of reproductive effort). Clutch mass, clutch size and egg sac mass are strongly correlated with female mass. Peucetia viridans has the reproductive tactic of producing young of optimum size, with the number of young varying in response to environmental pressures that influence female size, thus producing optimal reproductive effort. Relative clutch mass is also optimized and apparently not influenced by the variation in female mass, clutch mass or size. Egg sac mass per young is similar in small clutches and large clutches. These findings are discussed in terms of the species' life history characteristics.

N2  - Adult female crab spiders Misumena vatia that had previously hunted in large milkweed clones built nests on non-flowering milkweeds more often than predicted and used smaller than average leaves for their nests. These results suggest that they actively select nest sites at both stem and leaf levels. In commencing a nest, spiders first pulled the distal third of a leaf under the rest of the leaf, secured it with silk, and then rested inside this space. A few days later they laid their eggs there, sealed the edges of the leaf around the egg mass with silk and then guarded the nest, typically resting on its lower side. Spiders always left the last stem upon which they hunted before nesting and usually selected milkweed leaves on a stem several meters away from their hunting site for their nest site.

N2  - Cursorial spiders were studied in northeast Missouri from April-November 1980 in annually manipulated old-fields, in fields undergoing succession from manipulations, and a control field. Manipulations included burning, mowing, and plowing. Eleven cursorial families were collected in the study. Pitfall traps were used as the collecting device. Spider communities were compared using Bray-Curtis similarity indices. Seasonal and monthly spider and plant diversities were calculated using the Shannon Index. Spider diversity was correlated with plant diversity during May. The relative abundance of five spider species was correlated with the importance value of several plant species.

N2  - Mortality rates were measured in Euscorpius flavicaudis larvae which had been made to stay on their mother's back (as actually occurs in nature) or had been separated from their mother, under three different relative humidity levels. Mortality was greatest among larvae exposed to low RH levels and in any cases, among larvae separated from their mother. The mother-offspring relationship likely serves several functions: it is an obvious defense against predators and provides an optimum micro-habitat selection. These experiments suggest that the mother may also provide a greater resistance to dehydration, either by water-proofing the larvae or by refurnishing their water loss.

P.-Cambridge 1883), S. andamanicum (Simon 1888), S. colemani sp. nov., S. maculatum (Roewer 1963), S. pectinatum Kulczy&#324;ski 1908, and S. seychellanum Simon 1898. Sason cinctipes (Pocock 1892) and S. armatoris Pocock 1900 are newly synonymized with S. robustum (O. P.-Cambridge 1883), and Chrysopelma Roewer 1963 with Sason. Rhianus (= Rhianodes) and Monodontium are transferred to the Barychelinae. Sason occurs in the Seychelles, India, Ceylon, the Andaman Islands, New Guinea, to the islands of the Northwestern Pacific, and in northern Australia. Its distribution is similar to that of other Indo-Pacific taxa; a vicariance hypothesis is proposed for its historical biogeography.

Microscopy of the eyes shows that the melanin granules normally present in the epidermis and in the retina are represented by non-pigmented premelanosomes. Though the components of the eye are all present, the rhabdoms are abnormal, consisting of reduced and disorganised microvilli. The phaospheres, present in retinula cells, are also abnormal. The nature of the defects and their possible consequence are discussed.

N2  - Groups of size 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 Mallos gregalis were monitored under laboratory conditions with the aid of a computer-controlled digital camera. Data collected included a measure of the density and complexity of the silk comprising the nest, as well as activity levels and occupation of space within experimental arenas. Average web density and complexity was related to colony size, with the larger colonies building more complex nests. I suggest that the greater web complexity would allow larger colonies greater opportunities for the exploitation of marginal habitats. The webs built by the two smaller groupings were similar to those built by solitary dictynids and indicated that M. gregalis may be a facultatively-social spider. An estimate of mean silk deposition per spider indicated that members of the larger colonies exerted less effort in web construction than spiders in the two smaller groupings. Colony activity was related to group size and exhibited evidence for a group effect in the patterning of a...

N2  - Metepeira spinipes F. O. Pickard-Cambridge, a communal/territorial orb-weaver from Mexico, shows considerable geographic variation and temporal flexibility in spacing. A series of laboratory studies was conducted to test whether the variation in spacing observed in the field is solely the result of behavioral plasticity in response to environmental conditions, or the result of mechanisms inherent in different populations (i.e., genetic differences in behavior). Spiders from source populations in desert and moist tropical habitats were collected as eggs and raised in the laboratory under identical controlled conditions. Measurements of three-dimensional spacing parameters in laboratory colonies (nearest neighbor distance, within-colony density) have shown significant differences in spatial organization between populations, suggesting a genetic basis to these differences. Behavioral observations confirm that there are behavioral ecotypes within this species, with levels of sociality adapted to the regions i...

N2  - The ecology of the spider Agelenopsis consociata in rain forest habitats in Gabon was investigated with reference to factors that might underlie its cooperative foraging behavior. Colonies consisted of local clusters of from one to 27 nests and associated web traps. The composition of individual nests also was highly variable, ranging from one adult spider to as many as 1100 adults. Nest survivorship was a positive function of group size as estimated by the number of adult females in a nest. Analysis of the energy budget of single adult females indicated that the high rate of extinction of small nests might result from insufficient prey availabilities during the two rainy seasons when webs are destroyed on 40% of the days. Individuals associated with larger nests do not experience this energy deficit because individual investment in the web trap decreases with increasing colony size. Dispersal problems may also favor the maintenance of groups: we observed heavy predation on individuals that were released ...

N2  - Spiders of the species, Achaearanea tepidariorum (Araneae; Theridiidae), were held in enclosures under two prey regimes. One group of 100 spiders was provided with 100 fruit flies (Diptera; Drosophilidae; Drosophila melanogaster) per day and the second group of 100 spiders was provided with 1000 fruit flies per day. The number of spiders in enclosures dropped during the first six days in both groups. However, a higher rate of cannibalism in the low prey group caused the spider numbers in that enclosure to drop more rapidly than the high prey group. A greater proportion of the spiders in the low prey group settled into recognizable territories in the first six days than in the high prey group. Spiders in the high prey group tended to move more and therefore encounter conspecifics more frequently during observations. It is projected that tolerance, observed in these normally solitary spiders when large amounts of prey are present, could lead to more complex sociality if maintained under such conditions for ...

N2  - Anelosimus eximius is a cooperative, group-living neotropical spider. Colonies consist of up to several thousand individuals, and colonies may be aggregated into local colony clusters. The colony clusters are patchily distributed, and are often separated from their neighbors by a km or more. In this study individuals were collected from colonies located in Panama and Suriname. These individuals were subjected to horizontal starch gel electrophoresis and screened for polymorphisms in 46 enzyme systems. A total of 51 scorable loci were found, of which seven were polymorphic. The results were analyzed with Wright's F statistics which were used to investigate the amount of genetic differentiation in the population attributable to subdivision of the population into colonies, colony clusters, local populations and the geographic regions of Panama and Suriname. Most of the genetic differentiation in the A. eximius sampled was due to subdivision of the population into colony clusters and into geographic regions. ...

Why does social life disappear in these species? Several arguments lead us to involve trophic factors and to formulate the hypothesis that food shortages, resulting from the increase in the young's food requirements and from the limitation of the colony's prey supply, induce the spiderlings to emigrate. To test this hypothesis, laboratory-reared colonies (mother + offspring) of the funnel-web spider Coelotes terrestris (Wider) were given either an ad-libitum diet, or a reduced diet. We observed that prey consumption increased with developmental age, and that under-fed colonies dispersed significantly earlier than did ad-libitum-fed colonies. The significance of such social plasticity in the evolution of spider societies is discussed.

N2  - Since the earliest studies of social behavior in spiders, their social structure has often been compared with that of social insects. A preliminary conclusion was that the degree of evolution of spider societies was significantly lower than that found in insects. However, we wonder if the problem has been correctly posed. In light of Wilson's and Michener's works, enriched by those of the French School (Grasse, LeMasne), we accept the definition of insect societies with all the terms which seem necessary to characterize them, namely inter-attraction and its multiple consequences, social polymorphism and dominance. In our analysis, we evoke overlap of generations and the foundation of societies to demonstrate the inherent contradiction of comparing social behavior of insects and spiders. The sociality of spiders, which actually seems to exclude the dominance and hierarchy of individuals, is paradoxically catalogued among inferior societies. With insight gained from recent studies, we suggest here that soci...

N2  - Males of a social theridiid spider, Achaearanea wau Levi, have a prolonged and complex courtship in the communal web. They also mate opportunistically, by copulating with females engaged in molting or feeding. Ritualized aggression occurs between males during attempts to mate with molting females and during courtship. I describe the courtship, mating, and agonistic behaviors observed in A. wau and the conditions in which the different behaviors occur and discuss ways in which the social organization may have modified mating behavior. This is the first detailed description of the mating system of a highly social species of spider.

N2  - Orb-weaving spiders that live in groups modify their web structure and activity periods, in contrast to solitary araneids that build more individually distinctive orbs. Individually marked spiders (n = 62) of the colonial Metabus gravidus (Araneidae) in Costa Rica were monitored for 5-day periods during which all webs spun were measured. Variation in web characters (particularly web angle and viscid spiral measures) within an individual is related to time of day and degree of aggregation. Comparisons of six orb-weaving species suggest that spiders joining aggregation vary their web characteristics when in groups.

N2  - Three populations of the neotropical theridiid Anelosimus eximius were studied, one in the lowlands were the year shows distinct seasonal cycles, a second in the intermediate uplands, and a third in the mountains where seasonal changes in climate are less pronounced. Colonies in the lowlands showed a large monthly variation in egg production, presence of immature spiderlings and colony biomass. Colonies in the mountains showed less variation. In all sites the sex ratios were variable but were always skewed in favor of females. The sex ratio bias was independent of seasonal factors. It was presumably also independent of other environmental factors, with the exception of predation, which apparently was suffered more by females.

N2  - In northern Queensland the eggs of Latrodectus hasselti have a lower developmental temperature threshold than do postembryos which in turn have a lower threshold than first instar spiderlings prior to emergence from the egg sac. Emerged spiderlings, however, develop normally at temperatures below that which would prevent emergence from the egg sac. Arrested development of free-living first instar spiderlings may require a temperature of 10&#176;C or less (Forster 1984). The subsequent stadia for both sexes are in general shorter than for the American species of Latrodectus which mature later and live longer than L. hasselti. For all species of Latrodectus for which temperature-controlled data are available males have consistently longer early stadia than do females, partly compensating for an asynchrony in time to maturity. L. hasselti males usually matured in the fourth instar, females in the sixth.

N2  - Spiders of 10 families, 16 genera, and at least 21 species were collected from foliage of Picea rubens Sarg. in northern Maine. Foliage samples were collected from tree crowns using an extendable pole pruner. Of 157 individuals, erigonids were numerically dominant (36%), followed by philodromids (18%) and salticids (15%). Mean spider &lt;tex-math&gt;$\text{densities}/{\rm m}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; of foliage area were nonsignificant among sampling sites, but significantly more (P = 0.05) spiders were collected during the second sampling period (24-25 July) than during the first sampling period (7-8 June). Differences in spider densities between sampling periods were attributed to 1) seasonal activities and reproductive cycles of individual species, 2) weather during collection of foliage samples, and 3) two sampling methods (i.e., pole pruner with clamping device or pole pruner with catchment basket). Spider-budworm relationships and spider-habitat associations are discussed.

N2  - Coniferous-habitat associations were determined for 16 species of adult spiders collected from red spruce foliage in northern Maine. Most of the spiders have been found on three or more (range one to 15) conifer species. Spider-conifer habitats were positively correlated (r = 0.96) with geographic states and provinces. Mean conifer-habitat associations did not differ between web spinner and hunter species. Significantly more species of spiders from red spruce foliage were associated with northern conifers than with western conifers, but not with southern conifers. Comparison of the red spruce fauna with 16 selected spider-tree faunal studies showed that 1) S&#248;rensen's similarity quotients (QS) were significantly greater for genera than for species, and 2) mean species QS values were significantly greater for northern than for southern but not for western conifers.

N2  - Individuals of Dysdera crocata and Ariadna bicolor usually drown during the first day of submersion in aerated water (21 to 25&#176;C). However, if submerged while in their nests, they remain capable of activity for up to 10 days. Those residing underwater for the average of 3 days or for a longer period cannot continue to rely on the original oxygen supply of the nest's air store, which is less than a 2-day supply. A decrease in dissolved oxygen in the water, as measured in closed systems, indicates that the bubble held in the nest acts as a physical gill, with oxygen uptake averaging 3 to 4 &#956;l h&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for the nests of adult spiders. Thus, the spider's survival underwater depends on the nest's preventing the Ege effect from diminishing the bubble. Flooding, which could occur in any of the terrestrial habitats of various ancestral arthropods, should be included among the several factors hypothesized to have favored the evolutionary origin of silk nests in spiders and similar constructions in certain oth...

Burrowing, mating, oviposition, and feeding behaviors are described and compared with other solifuge species. Thermoregulatory behavior, previously undocumented for solifuges, is associated with diurnal habits. Populations were bivoltine in 1979, whereas all solifuges previously studied have been univoltine. The biology of M. picta is otherwise similar to that of nocturnal species from North African, South-west Asian, and North American deserts.

N2  - The development and egg sac production of Achaearanea tepidariorum were investigated at 25&#176;C and long (16L-8D) or short (10L-14D) photoperiod. The development of nymphs was completed in 30-80 days in 4-6 molts in the male and in 40-100 days in 5-7 molts in the female. Under the long photoperiod, the development of males was accelerated by the omission of one or two molts when food conditions were favorable, but under the short photoperiod such an acceleration tended to be cancelled by prolongation of either the last instar or the last and penultimate instars. This tendency was also observed in the female, but not so clearly as in the male. The development proceeded more speedily in complete darkness than under light. Adult females produced a mean of 9.7 egg sacs at intervals of 8.1 days. The mean egg number per sac showed a gradual decrease with time. The mean total egg number produced per female was 1812.7, and the mean longevity was 116.5 days in the female and 33.9 days in the male.

N2  - Tetragnatha elongata is associated exclusively with riparian habitats. The physiological suitability of a given environment is determined by accessibility to open water. When this is denied, spiders suffer dehydration, the rate of which is determined by the temperature and relative humidity. Where the abiotic environment is suitable, spiders build webs on any available structural support. The webs of T. elongata are short lived. Once a web has been built, a spider may rebuild at the same site or move to a new site. Prey availability appears to be the primary determinant as to which of these alternatives is adopted.

N2  - The influence of web morphology and allometry on respiration and energetics was investigated in the purse-web spider, Sphodros abboti. Carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in gas samples from underground portions of the nest where these spiders normally reside did not differ significantly from those in atmospheric air. Web dimensions such as length, diameter, and surface area scaled geometrically to body size. The scaling of these relationships differed from expected. Since the surface area of the web functions in prey detection, I anticipated it would scale in parallel with increases in energy demand that accompany size increases. Rates of oxygen consumption serve as an index of the latter and scale in direct proportion to body size whereas web surface area scales only to the two-thirds power. The weight of the web scaled to a power less than predicted by simple geometry, a result interpreted as an adaptation towards reducing costs of web construction. These results and comparisons suggest the web an...

N2  - The bowl and doily spider, Frontinella pyramitela (Araneae, Linyphiidae), receives information about its world primarily through its senses of touch (including vibrations) and taste. We report here that when a male touches the carcass of a conspecific mounted on the web of an adult female, the male receives information about the sex of the carcass. Moreover, the information is encoded in chemical form on the cuticles of both sexes of adult spiders. Tarsal contact with the carcass of a male elicits many abdomen flexions but few foreleg waves from an assay male. In contrast, tarsal contact with the carcass of a female elicits far fewer abdomen flexions but many foreleg waves. Both intersexual differences are lost when the carcass has been washed in solvent.

N2  - Ballooning spiders were captured during a full growing season over agricultural habitats in Missouri, USA, and one week in New South Wales, Australia, using sticky traps in Missouri and tow nets in Australia. More than 2,000 spiders in Missouri and more than 800 spiders in Australia were identified to family and estimates made of their live masses. Both aeronaut faunas are dominated by the family Linyphiidae, with the remaining families making up different proportions at the two sites. The vast majority of aeronauts weighed between 0.2 and 1.0 mg, with the mass-frequency distributions at both sites tailing off rapidly beyond 2.0 mg. The most massive Missouri aeronaut weighed 25.5 mg, and the most massive Australian aeronaut 19.1 mg. These are the first published extensive data on the live masses of ballooning spiders from the field and this is the first taxonomic analysis of a Southern Hemisphere aeronaut fauna.

N2  - Female bowl and doily spiders, Frontinella pyramitela, build species-typical webs throughout their lives. In contrast, males of the species cease the construction of prey capture webs soon after they become adults, though they continue to be capable of producing sperm-induction webs and draglines. In this report we describe the timing of the senescence of web construction, analyze the structure and utility of the webs built by adult males, and eliminate two variables, mass at maturity and adult feeding history, as important contributors to the variability in rate of senescence.

In the first experiment, the possible benefits of females' presence were measured in terms of male longevity. In the second, food deprived and sated males were offered a choice of mating or feeding with a receptive female. In the first experiment, groups of individually-housed males were provided with: regularly fed females with which to mate and share prey and silk, freshly killed prey and female silk with no female, female's silk alone, or nothing at all. Solitary males provided with prey and silk lived longer than those in other groups: feeding on silk alone did not affect longevity. Males provided with females lived longer than those without. No significant relationship between body size and longevity was noted in either summer. In the second experiment, two groups of male Nephila were deprived of food for a week. One group was then fed prey partially eaten by a female. Males were t...

N2  - Crab spiders Misumena vatia typically guard their nests after laying eggs. Individuals that disappeared from their nests before their young emerged had similar laying dates, pre- or post-laying mass, egg mass, or reproductive effort to those that remained. They included both individuals that actively left the sites and ones that died. Spiders lost mass constantly through the guarding period, but total losses in the field did not approach those from the laboratory and were unlikely to be the primary source of mortality. Few spiders caught prey during this time, and those captures had little effect on the rate of loss. Small day-to-day fluctuations in mass were largely a result of changes in moisture availability.

N2  - In the field in Nagano Prefecture, mature females of Sitticus fasciger (Simon, 1880) oviposit several times from June to July in their nests. The nest for oviposition is made in a cavity on a wall. The egg-mass size of reared spiders varies from six to 13 eggs. Spiderlings molt five or six times and mature in late July to early August of the next year from hatching. The duration from egg to adult, which includes days of overwintering, varies from 377 to 428 days. A few adults copulate before overwintering, however, the majority copulate in May or June of the year following maturation. All females oviposit in early summer of the year following maturation. It was confirmed that the life history of this species in Nagano Prefecture is a two-year cycle. The population of this species in Nagano Prefecture consists of two groups in which their generation cycles differ from each other. It seems that the mechanism avoiding the reproductive isolation among these two groups is the intergenerational copulation betwe...

N2  - This study shows that Deinopis spinosus Marx has at least two stereotyped attack behaviors, each elicited by different stimuli. In &quot;backward&quot; strikes the spider expands the net backward over its cephalothorax and away from the substrate; these strikes capture aerial prey. Vibratory stimuli are sufficient to elicit backward strikes. In &quot;forward&quot; strikes the spider expands the web downward and forward against the substrate; these strikes capture walking prey, and visual rather than vibratory stimuli are more effective. We describe the mechanisms underlying each type of strike and the extraordinary extensibility of the web.

N2  - Guarding green lynx spiders reduce egg sac mortality from two major sources, ants and sac dislodgement, using specific behavior patterns. However, they do not discriminate against egg sacs parasitized by mantispids, which are a third important mortality source. When ants are placed on egg sacs females attack, relocate the sac, or cut attachment lines so that the sac hangs from a minimal number of threads. Egg sacs are also relocated in response to other disturbances. The method of moving the egg sac relies heavily on silk lines and is distinct from that of lycosids and pisaurids.

N2  - Spider prey of the Blue Mud Dauber, Chalybion californicum (Saussure), in eastern Missouri included 15 species representing four families. Araneidae was the most diverse family (nine species), but Theridiidae were more numerous, with Steatoda americana (Emerton) outnumbering all other species combined. Temporal abundances of the nine spider taxa most commonly captured by the wasps in Missouri suggest that wasps collect spiders in numbers relative to their seasonal and relative abundances, accessibility as prey, or size suitability. Spider prey of the same wasp species in northern Florida included 31 species representing nine families. Araneidae was both the most diverse (19 species) and most numerous family and exhibited a pattern of seasonal increase in abundance as prey of C. californicum. Theridiidae constituted a majority of the total individuals in both the Missouri survey and a similar survey from Maryland, while a corresponding study in southern Oklahoma resembled the Florida survey in having high ...

N2  - Courtship and copulatory behavior were observed in the funnel-web spider, Hololena adnexa (Chamberlin and Gertsch). Overall these behaviors were similar to those reported for Agelenopsis species. However, behavioral differences were found in the precopulation stage. An unusual pattern for male palpal insertion duration during copulation was discovered. Initial short duration insertions were followed by a peak of longer insertion durations; however, subsequent insertions decreased in duration. The peak in insertion duration was postulated to correspond to the maximum time of transfer of sperm.

N2  - The mating behavior of the nursery web spider Pisaurina mira is described for the first time. These spiders mate while suspended from draglines as in Oxyopes heterophthalmus (Latr.) and Peucetia viridans (Hentz). The unique feature of the mating in P. mira, however, is the male's use of a veil of silk to wrap the female's legs I and II into a flexed position prior to copulation while her legs III and IV are held in a flexed position by the male's embrace. Mating is accomplished in a version of position II with body axes in a right angle as the female is cradled by the male's legs. The use of silk to &quot;tie&quot; the female is reported elsewhere only in Xysticus.

N2  - A species of Linothele (Dipluridae), was studied in Soberan&#237;a Park (Panam&#225;) and the lower elevation, more humid Department of Choc&#243; (Colombia). The purpose of the study was to determine behavior related to web construction, prey capture, design and trophic efficiency of the web, food source, migration, agonistic behavior and associated kleptoparasites. Differences between temperatures during the day were also studied inside and outside the spider's retreat. Positive correlations in the variables of body weight vs. body length; weight vs. diameter of the web orifice; body weight vs. the maximum web dimension; body length vs. maximum web diameter were found in both zones. The webs of these spiders are characterized by having a number of associated symbionts, some of them true kleptoparasites. The spiders discriminate in their choice of prey and are most active at night. There was no evidence that they could excavate their own retreat cavities and they showed high levels of inter- and intraspecific agonistic...

N2  - Spiders of 15 families, 76 genera, and at least 125 species were collected by pitfall traps in a spruce-budworm infested forest of northern Maine. Species of Lycosidae were numerically dominant and accounted for 56.2 and 54.1% of the total trapped specimens in 1977 and 1978, respectively. For both study years, significantly more (P &#8804; 0.05) individuals and species of spiders were captured in clearcut strips than in either uncut residual strips or dense stands. Peaks in seasonal activity of spiders generally coincided with the spruce budworm's early and late larval stages; spiders were also abundant and active during budworm oviposition and dispersal of 1st instars. Diversity of spider species was generally greater in dense stands and uncut residual strips than in clearcut strips. Individuals were distributed unevenly among species but more evenly in dense stands and uncut residual strips than in clearcut strips.

Numbers of species and individuals differed between web-spinner and hunter foraging strategies. S&#248;rensen's similarity quotient (QS) indicated that the Malaise-trapped fauna had greater similarity to arboreal than to terrestrial spider faunas of northeastern spruce-fir forests. Spider-trap interactions include accidental capture and possibly attraction; attractive features include trap architecture, concentrated potential prey, and protective shelter.

A: adult females on their own webs; juveniles on their own webs; adult males on webs built by adult females; adult males on webs built by juveniles. Although adult males do not build webs, they are fully capable of capturing prey in foreign webs. Male behavior was basically similar to females and juveniles. However, males showed high frequency in certain units of behavior in the prey detection phase (particularly males on female webs). A sexual origin for these units of behavior is suggested. Sexual interference would reduce the predatory efficiency of males but also probably reduce the risk of female predation on males in the field. /// Se entregaron presas (hormigas Acromyrmex sp.) a cuatro grupos experimentales de Metepeira sp.

N2  - In the social eresid spider Stegodyphus mimosarum, most individuals under natural conditions live in colonies containing up to several hundred individuals. Female size at maturity is reduced in large colonies as is the number of eggs produced per female. This reduction of female fecundity seems to result from increasing competition over food as the number of females in a colony increases, and is interpreted in terms of a &quot;constraint&quot; model for group living proposed by Emlen (1984).

N2  - Stridulating male jumping spiders in the Habronattus agilis species group have a file on the back of the cephalothorax and stout, curved setae on the front of the abdomen. Compared to non-stridulating Habronattus speces, stridulators have modified sclerites around the pedicel, and much more massive muscles running from the lorum to the dorsal carapace apodeme and from the side of the pedicel to the epigastric plate. Sound mostly below 3500 Hz is produced during courtship when the abdomen is vibrated up and down against the back of the carapace. When most of the scraper setae are ablated, the sound is diminished. Stridulation may have evolved from the common salticid behavior of abdomen twitching.

Spider densities per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of foliage area generally were greater (P &#8806; 0.05) on spruces (X&#772; = 16.3 &#177; 1.1) than on fir (X&#772; = 10.9 &#177; 1.0). Estimates of absolute populations of arboreal spiders ranged from 35,139 to 323,080/ha; of spruce budworm from 271,401 to 6,122,919/ha. Spider-budworm densities/ha covaried significantly (P &#8806; 0.001) each year (r = 0.84, 1985; r = 0.71, 1986). None of the measured forest-stand parameters (basal area, tree species percentage) were reliable predictors of spider populations/ha.

N2  - Specimens of Siro exilis Hoffman, Vonones sayi (Simon), Erebomaster sp., Leiobunum vittatum (Say), Leiobunum holtae McGhee, Hadrobunus maculosus (Wood), Eumesosoma nigrum (Say), Odiellus pictus (Wood), Caddo agilis Banks, and Hesperonemastoma kepharti (Crosby and Bishop) were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Features of the dorsal integument of each specimen are described using available terminology. Variations in the generalized tuberculate-granulate morphology were observed in eight of the ten species studied. V. sayi, C. agilis, and O. pictus exhibit a morphological gradient in features of their dorsal integuments. The presence of micropores is reported from the apices of tubercles of L. vittatum, L. holtae, H. maculosus, and O. pictus and from the cuticular backgrounds of S. exilis, V. sayi, and E. nigrum. The morphological descriptions and comparisons presented provide a terminology for describing opilionid cuticular features.

The genus Pycnothele comprises three species that are redescribed and illustrated: Pycnothele auronitens (Keyserling, 1891) (=Androthelopsis modestus: Raven, 1985 (in part.) and Psalistops auripilus Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1946 new synonyms); Pycnothele perdita Chamberlin, 1917; and Pycnothele singularis (Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1934) new combination (=Pycnothelopsis modestus Schiapelli &amp; Gerschman, 1942 and Androthelopsis modestus: Raven, 1985 (in part) new synonyms). Heteromma anomala Mello-Leit&#227;o, 1934, although it belongs to Pycnothele, is an uncertain species. A taxonomic key is included for species identification.

N2  - Comparisons of webs spun in the field when both sticky and non-sticky silk supplies were complete, when both were recently depleted, and when only non-sticky supplies were depleted show that Leucauge mariana and Micrathena sexspinosa vary design features of their orbs such as numbers of radii and sticky spiral loops, web area and proportion covered with sticky spiral, sticky spiral symmetry, and spaces between sticky spiral loops in response to changes in the amounts of both sticky and non-sticky silk that they have available. Spider size, spider weight and possibly website also influence L. mariana web designs.

N2  - The feeding of radiolabeled conspecific orb webs to Araneus cavaticus Keyserling clearly demonstrated the ability of this species to solubilize nearly all of the orb web, although in no instance was complete solubilization achieved. A principal component of the nonsolubilized portion is probably minor ampullate silk, as spiders fed pulled minor ampullate silk were unable to solubilize the majority of the samples. In contrast, spiders were able to completely solubilize pulled major ampullate silk. Despite the overall high percentage of web solubilization, the recycling efficiencies obtained, while variable, were never in excess of 32% (as determined using webs built by spiders fed &lt;tex-math&gt;${}^{14}{\rm C}\text{-glucose}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;). A complete assessment of web recycling will have to consider the fate of ingested low molecular weight adhesive spiral components as well as web proteins. Of those components which have been identified, only GABamide was followed in the present study due to the labeled compou...

N2  - Courtship and mating in Dictyna volucripes Keys. are described on the basis of laboratory observations of 13 virgin pairs. Their behavior conformed well to the general pattern within the family. Various features of both female and male behavior are consistent with the view that courtship functions mainly in influencing mate-choice by females, rather than in inhibiting predatory attack upon males. Laboratory and field observations show that pairs commonly remain together for some days after mating. While the function of such cohabitation is unknown, it can evidently provide an important preadaptation in the evolution of spider sociality.

N2  - A survey of the spiders associated with northern California rice fields was conducted to identify potential biological-control agents of rice feeding insects and mosquitoes. All of the 28 species were collected on the levees; however, only 10 of these were taken in the paddies. Pardosa ramulosa (McCook), Pirata piraticus (Clerck) and two linyphiid spp. were common throughout the agroecosystem. These spiders exhibited a seasonal succession in relative abundance within the paddy during the growing season. Pardosa ramulosa was dominant both on the levees and in the paddies. It comprised ca. 58 and 68% of the fauna in these respective areas. We suggest that the flooded paddies may serve as a refuge for the semiaquatic P. ramulosa during the dry summer months and that its abundance in California rice fields is due in part to the similarity of this agroecosystem to the native, pre-agricultural habitat.

Most host individuals (89%) were parasitized by only one larva, but as many as nine larvae were attached to one host. Adult and immature hosts of both sexes were parasitized. All larval mites were attached to the lateral molt sutures, mostly on the posterior prosoma. A review of the literature reveals 30 records of mite ectoparasitism of spiders among eight mite genera from five continents. Six additional records are reported herein. Two species listed as spider parasites, Allothrombium metae Boshell &amp; Kerr (Acari, Trombidiidae) and Copriphis bristowi Finnegan (Acari, Laelapidae), are transferred to Clinotrombium and Ljunghia, respectively.

N2  - Trichobothriotaxic evolution was studied through the postembryonic development of Theridion rufipes. It was found that this species belongs to the plesiomorphic pattern (Lehtinen 1980) and only presents basal growth. The number of trichobothria on the tibia of the male palp is three and on the female palp is five. The total number of trichobothria on specimens of different sexes is similar because the same number of molts is necessary for reaching adult stage, being six trichobothria on the tibia of leg IV for both sexes. On the tibia of leg I the number of trichobothria is five in males and six in females. The individual variation between right side and left or between specimens of different sexes is not significant. /// En el presente trabajo se estudi&#243; la evoluci&#243;n de la tricobotriotaxia a trav&#233;s del desarrollo postembrionario de Theridion rufipes.

N2  - The predatory behavior of Metleucauge kompirensis (Boes. et Str.), M. yunohamensis (Boes. et Str.) and Metleucauge sp. was studied, and the natural prey of the former two species were collected from their webs. These species did not immobilize their prey by wrapping, but immobilized them only by biting. The lack of immobilization wrapping in Metleucauge can be explained by two different hypotheses: 1) Metleucauge remains in the primitive stage of the evolution of predatory behavior, or 2) the habit of immobilization wrapping has been lost, because Metleucauge captures weakly flying insects (mainly midges and mayflies) which can be immobilized without wrapping.

N2  - Over a seven-year period, approximately 35,000 spiders representing 26 families, 133 genera, and 234 species were captured in Washington County, Mississippi, by pitfall, sweepnet, vacuum, bag, and hand. Specimens were collected in 10 different habitat types and in four vegetational strata. Old-field habitats yielded the most species (152) and residential lawns the fewest (14). Considering all habitats sampled, the ground layer produced 111 species, the herbaceous strata 133, the shrub layer 49, and the tree strata 30 species. The sweepnet method of capture obtained 128 species, pitfall 95, hand 61, vacuum 53, and bagging 19 species. The largest number of species were obtained in spring and early summer (maximum of 125 in May), with the fewest in mid-winter (Jan. = 24). Twenty-one species were considered abundant, 51 common, 67 uncommon, and 95 rare. Additions to the state list of Dorris (1972) number 102 species, for a new state total of 364 species.

N2  - In the Delta area of Mississippi, a 13-month sampling program in old-field habitats adjacent to cotton fields demonstrated high densities of Pisaurina mira in June, which was coincident with high Lygus lineolaris populations. In July, P. mira populations were lower by 50% and L. lineolaris by almost 100%. From August through October, P. mira populations continued to decline while L. lineolaris increased. Field observations in the same old-field habitats indicated L. lineolaris to be the most frequently captured prey item of P. mira. In laboratory feeding experiments over a 3-year period, all P. mira individuals consumed L. lineolaris and 22 of 35 other species of co-occurring potential arthropod prey. These data suggest that the predator P. mira may affect L. lineolaris populations and can survive on other prey when L. lineolaris is less abundant.

N2  - I tested whether female crab spiders Misumena vatia responded differently to their own nests and to other spider nests or parts of nests. They accepted nests of conspecifics as readily as their own, although initially showing more activity on others' nests than their own. They accepted intact M. vatia nests more often than nest silk placed on leaves, turned-under leaves, or artificial nests; and unaltered leaves less frequently than any of the latter. They accepted nests of other spider species less frequently than conspecific nests, probably in response to the differences between these nests and conspecific nests. Some crab spiders about to lay their eggs accepted conspecific nests, but hunting adult females did not accept them more than predicted by chance.

Evidence from scanning electron micrographs supports the monophyly of orbweavers (Orbiculariae = Uloboridae, Deinopidae, Araneoidea), the araneid subfamily Cyrtophorinae and the close relationship between Nesticidae and Theridiidae. This evidence is presented in the context of guidelines for the logical taxonomic interpretation of spider spigot morphology. This morphological system, including gross and detailed morphology, location and number of spigots, and serial homology relationships, may be one of the most complex, yet under-utilized, taxonomic character systems in spiders.

N2  - Foliage-dwelling spiders were collected using sweep nets in pond pine, sand pine scrub, and flatwoods plant communities on the University of Central Florida campus near Orlando. Collections were made bimonthly from May, 1983 through March, 1984. A total of 4,022 spiders was collected; 2,076 in pond pine, 1,258 in sand pine scrub, and 688 in flatwoods. Spider diversity was greatest in pond pine, followed by sand pine scrub and then flatwoods community. Similarity in spider species was greatest between pond pine and flatwoods. Salticids represented 40.2% of the combined populations. Misumenops celer (Hentz) was found in all three plant communities and was abundant.

N2  - Arthropods were collected monthly during a 13-month period from Spanish moss on water oak trees in Leroy Percy State Park, Washington County, Mississippi. Of the ca 2000 arthropods collected, spiders (600), bettles (600), chalcidoid wasps (500), and miscellaneous insects (300) represented the major groups. Peak population levels of spiders occurred in spring and fall, as did the occurrence of various crop pests. Spiders were represented by 13 families, 22 genera, and 29 species. Seventy percent of the total spider sample was composed of two species that breed in Spanish moss, Metaphidippus tillandsiae Kaston and Anyphaena maculata (Banks). Steadily declining non-spider anthropod populations in Spanish moss throughout the fall-winter-spring period suggest that the predatory activity of spiders may have an effect on over-wintering arthropod populations.

N2  - External reproductive organs of spiders are often species-specific and are important taxonomic characters in species identification. One explanation of this is the mechanical isolation or lock-and-key hypothesis. It predicts that in closely related species with overlapping ranges, morphological character displacement should occur in regions of sympatry to prevent costly interspecific copulation attempts. To test this hypothesis, we measured homologous external genital sclerites of male Larinioides (Nuctenea) sclopetaria and L. patagiata (Araneidae) and statistically compared their means and variances for sympatric and allopatric regions of their distribution. Differences in both mean and variance were observed, but the number of sclerites that differed between regions of sympatry and allopatry was not greater than the number that differed between adjacent regions of sympatry. Thus, these species failed to demonstrate the character displacement predicted by the mechanical isolation hypothesis.

N2  - The phenology, abundance, and habitat preferences of Pardosa ramulosa (McCook) in California rice fields were studied. Analysis of pitfall and floating sticky-trap samples showed that this spider apparently had one generation per year and overwintered in the immature stage. The population on the levees peaked in June and preceded the buildup in the paddies. Colonization of the paddies was possible after emergent vegetation was present. Before this P. ramulosa was observed being blown over the water surface. This may have contributed to its ability to disperse within the rice agroecosystem. In the paddies, P. ramulosa was associated with patches of aquatic broadleaf weeds where potential prey, including occasional pest species, was most abundant. P. ramulosa possesses many attributes thought to be desirable for a natural enemy in an annual agroecosystem, and may be an important predator of some pest species in rice.

N2  - The Hawaiian happy-face spider Theridion grallator Simon is a small spider, endemic to Hawaii, where it is found under leaves in the wet and mesic forests. The abdomen is pale, translucent yellow, but variable amounts of red, black or white pigment may be superimposed on this to generate a host of patterned morphs. The translucence of the abdomen may enhance crypsis against predators searching the underside of leaves; the variability in the superimposed pattern may serve to counteract the development of a search image by the predator. The present study documents plasticity in base coloration, which can change rapidly and markedly following ingestion of certain types of prey. This may be merely a consequence of abdominal translucence. But it is interesting to note that it adds a whole new dimension to the color polymorphism of the species.

Significantly more (G-tests, P &#8804; 0.05) male than female moths were captured by 9 web-spinner species, and the overall capture by spiders was significantly biased (P &#8804; 0.001) toward male moths. Most of the budworm-moth prey were found in webs of Frontinella pyramitela (Walck.) (30.6%) and Theridion pictum (Walck.) (45.0%).

N2  - Spectral sensitivities of primary and secondary eyes in the Theraphosid spider, Aphonopelma chalcodes Chamberlin, were investigated by recording intracellular receptor potentials from single photoreceptors. The responses of all cells were graded depolarizations, monophasic in waveform. All cells showed dual spectral sensitivities, with a primary peak near 500 nm and a secondary peak in the near ultraviolet at 370 nm. The 500 nm peaks were fit well by a Dartnall nomogram. Spectral sensitivity curves were similar under both dark and light adaptation suggesting the presence of a single photopigment. Intensity-response functions with white light showed sensitivity differences between primary and secondary eyes. Secondary eyes had greater sensitivity ranges and smaller slope coefficients showing them to be more sensitive than primary eyes.

Strikingly similar glands have subsequently been found in the Leptonetidae, some Salticidae, and now in the genus Cybaeota (Agelenidae). The spatial distribution of the glands in Cybaeota is described. Their placement on the bodies of these spiders supports the repugnatorial secretion hypothesis proposed for them in the Telemidae. The phylogenetic implications of the scattered distribution of this character in spiders are discussed.

Experimental copulation within a subsample confirmed that all were the same species. These results seems to be uncommon in spiders and may result from: i) female moulting after maturity ecdysis; ii) allometric growth of spermathecae; iii) multiple sexual selection by female choice (according to female size) and its effects on male genitalic evolution. /// Un an&#225;lisis cuantitativo de caracteres som&#225;ticos y genitales realizado en una muestra de Grammostola mollicoma (Ausserer, 1875) mostr&#243; una variaci&#243;n intraespec&#237;fica mayor en caracteres genitales que en los som&#225;ticos, especialmente en hembras.

N2  - We studied the biology of the green lynx spider, Peucetia viridans, in South Carolina, with emphasis on the selection factors that maintain extended maternal care. Nocturnal predation on the clutch was greater than diurnal predation. Chiracanthium inclusum (Araneae, Clubionidae) was the primary predator of eggs and emerged spiderlings. After producing a fertile egg sac in the field, female P. viridans produced at least three fertile sacs in the laboratory. In the field, females produced a second egg sac if their first sac was lost early in the season. In contrast with other studies, spiderlings were unable to exit from about 74% of the egg sacs without the aid of the mother.

A new genus, Minicreagris, has been proposed, with Microcreagris pumila (Muchmore) as its type species. Genital areas and trichobothrial patterns are figured, and brief diagnoses and some taxonomic and distributional data for the genera and species examined are given. A key to the Microcreagris-related genera of North America north of Mexico is presented.

N2  - An analysis of 29 faunal surveys of spiders found in nine field crops in the United States indicates the presence of 614 species in 192 genera and 26 families. These species represent 19% of the ca. 3311 species occurring in North America. Five families included 61% of the species reported in field crops: Salticidae (89 spp.), Linyphiidae (78), Araneidae (77), Theridiidae (64), and Lycosidae (62). Considerably more species have been observed in cotton (308 spp.), soybean (262), and alfalfa (233) than in guar (52), rice (75), and grain sorghum (88). Intermediate numbers of species have been observed in peanuts (131), corn (136), and sugarcane (137). The North American spider fauna is estimated at the species level to be 59% web-spinners and 41% wanderers, while those reported from field crops are estimated to be 44% web-spinners and 56% wanderers. These differences may be attributable to guild characteristics associated with dispersal and ability to survive in disturbed habitats. The 42 most frequently occ...

N2  - The surface portion of the tube webs of Sphodros niger Hentz lies hidden at the interface between duff and overlying pine needles in early successional pitch pine-oak woods on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Males search for females in June. Spiderlings hatch in August and leave the mother the following April. Millipedes appear to be the principal food item. The surface tubes of older juvenile spiders vary from 13 to 15 cm in length and tend down slope. The surface tube has the consistency of thin parchment. The underground portion varies little in length, averaging 13 cm, and is a simple cylinder. The only adult female web found had a surface tube 63 cm in length. This female had at least 73 spiderlings.

N2  - Female Lycosa ceratiola, most of whom were gravid when collected in March in Florida, contained significantly less water than males (2.24 versus 2.88 mg water/mg dry mass, representing 69 and 74% of wet mass, respectively). Both sexes had similar amounts of hemolymph in their bodies (32.4% of wet mass in females and 37.3% in males). The density of hemolymph in male and female spiders at 22-24&#176; C averaged 1.00 mg/&#956;l. These results suggest that egg production in female spiders affects their total water content, most likely because ripening eggs gain energy-rich lipids at the expense of water. Two commonly used water content indices, which express water mass as a proportion of either wet or dry body mass, are evaluated.

N2  - This study investigated the relationship between male size and reproductive success in Nephila clavipes, a neotropical orb-weaving spider. Gross and palpal size variation were examined in relation to copulatory behavior. sperm transfer/uptake, and utilization by the female. The effect of conductor breakage was also evaluated by assessing the timing of its occurrence and its influence on sperm transfer. There was less variation in palp size of male N. clavipes than in other aspects of male morphology. Gross male body size correlated most highly with how much sperm was produced, transferred to, and stored by the female. Size of the male was not related, however, to the percentage of sperm actually transferred. The number of sperm retained by the female was influenced by the time of mating, but not by copulatory behavior. Approximately twice as many sperm were found in the palps of virgin males as were found in combined totals from mated pairs. This suggests that a substantial percentage of sperm transferred...

N2  - Egg size was used to estimate the energy incorporated into egg production in a sample of 24 species representing 11 families. Egg mass scaled geometrically to egg diameter. Egg mass can be accurately estimated from the easily measured diameter of an egg. Comparison of egg sizes between populations of seven species common to Connecticut and Florida suggest egg size is species-specific. The constancy of energy density of spider eggs allows relatively accurate estimates of the energy incorporated into egg production using easily obtained data on egg size, number of eggs per clutch, and number of clutches.

N2  - When disturbed, Uloborus glomosus either remain in position at the hub of their orb-webs, jump from the web, move to the edge of the web, or shake the web. The time of day influences which of these behaviors is expressed. Spiders tend to jump in the afternoon and the evening but not in the morning. In the morning they tend to move to the edge of the web or remain in position. The tendency to shake the web is approximately the same throughout the day. Ambient temperature appears not to be the principal factor explaining the differences in jumping, moving to the edge, and remaining in position. Historical differences in the activity patterns of various spider predators may have influenced the time-related expression of disturbance behavioral patterns.

These allopatric sister species appear to have cospeciated with their respective Mysmenopsis kleptoparasite species, also each other's closest relatives. The rate of divergent evolution of the two kleptoparasite populations appears to be greater than that of the host populations, in part, we suggest, because of the kleptoparasites' shorter generation time.

N2  - Activity patterns of a population of the burrow-dwelling theraphosid spider, Selenocosmia stirlingi Hogg, at Coombah (N.S.W.) are reported. Burrows were located and monitored at about 6-weekly intervals over a period of 3 years while rainfall and diurnal temperature profiles of the soil were also recorded. Spider activity was determined both from the condition of the burrow entrance and from the presence of the spider at the burrow entrance during the night. Activity was greatest in spring and late summer/fall, with low levels of activity in both winter and mid-summer. It is likely that the temperature profile in the soil was exploited behaviorally by the spiders in order to thermoregulate. Estimated losses of spiders from the population were greatest in spring and early summer, and may be due predominantly to maturing males leaving their burrows in search of females.

N2  - Two species of New World theraphosid; Theraphosa leblondi from French Guiana, and Megaphobema sp. from Ecuador incorporate abdominal setae into silk constructs. Theraphosa incorporates setae into the egg sacs and the silk mats on which they molt. Megaphobema sp. includes them in the egg sacs only. The setae used in the egg sacs by both these spiders are from the lateral region of the abdomens, the setae which Theraphosa uses in the silk mat are from the lateral and posterior regions. All abdominal regions tested on Theraphosa had urticating hairs present. To test the possible benefits of this behavior, the egg sacs and silk mats were tested for urticarial effect. The egg sacs failed to elicit any urticarial response in either humans or two species of mouse (Mus musculus and Peromyscus sp.). Egg sac material with or without setae was found to be an effective barrier to the larvae of the fly Megaselia scalaris. The silk mats of T. leblondi were found to be more effective at stopping the movement of M. scala...

N2  - Chromosomes of Caddo agilis (Caddidae) and fifteen species of Phalangiidae were investigated. In three species, Nelima satoi, N. similis, and Eumesosoma roeweri, presence of XY-XX (male heterogametic) sex chromosome system was newly ascertained. On the other hand, ZW-ZZ (female heterogametic) sex chromosome system was suggested to be present in Mitopus morio. Effeminate (2n = 20) and normal (2n = 18) males of Protolophus tuberculatus were found to differ in chromosome number. A survey of known records of chromosome numbers in Caddidae and Phalangiidae revealed a general trend that the number is greater in both Caddidae (2n = 30) and Phalangiinae (2n = 20-36), fewer in Gagrellinae (2n = 10-22), and intermediate in Leiobuninae (2n = 16-26). Evolutionary trends are briefly discussed and compared with those in other arachnids.

N2  - Spiders of 14 families, 34 genera, and at least 36 species were collected by formalin extraction from sub-litter habitats of the forest floor, Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge, Washington County, Maine, in 1987. Species per family ranged from 1 to 7; the Erigonidae had the richest representation with 19.4% of all species. Most species (64.0%) were represented by sexually mature spiders; the ratio of female to male spiders was 3.2:1. Species of web-spinning spiders outnumbered species of hunting spiders 2 to 1. Numbers of spiders/0.25 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; circular plot ranged from 1 to 4; mean overall density of sub-litter spiders was 1.12 &#177; 0.17 SE, where N = 36 plots. Most (67.3%) of the spiders were associated with only one forest-stand type, possibly indicating species-habitat specificity.

N2  - The uloborid Philoponella vicina differs from the araneoids Nephila clavipes and Leucauge mariana in one movement made during frame construction, in the ordering of frame construction, in proto-hub removal, and in the highly ordered sequence of operations on adjacent radii just before proto-hub removal. Data from other uloborids suggest that all of these differences may distinguish orb weaving uloborids in general from orb weaving araneoids. N. clavipes differs from the other two species in the order of lines laid during frame construction, in the high variability in the details of frame construction, and in its failure to remove recently laid lines during exploration, radius construction, and frame construction. Frame construction behavior in all three species is more variable than previous reports indicated, and more variable than behavior in later stages of orb construction. In all three species earlier frame construction more often involves breaking lines already present in the web. Similarity between...

N2  - The daily locomotor activity patterns of spiders of three large species of the genus Cupiennius (Ctenidae) were measured in an artificial 12:12 light:dark cycle. Adult males (N = 10) and females (N = 10) of each species of these nocturnal Central American wandering spiders were compared. On average, males were 3.5 (C. coccineus and C. getazi) to 12.7 (C. salei) times more active than females. Hence, males are the truly wandering spiders. We suggest that this is due to sexually motivated searching behavior of the males. Of the two sympatric species, the males and the females of C. coccineus were on average 3.1 times more active than those of C. getazi. In addition C. coccineus exhibited a relative minimum in its locomotor activity when C. getazi showed its absolute maximum. This difference in activity pattern may contribute to the reproductive isolation of these two sympatric species.

N2  - The duration of the reproductive and courtship periods, the number of individual matings, and the number of egg sacs and their viability were measured in Lycosa tarentula fasciiventris under laboratory conditions. We found that the reproductive period is very short, lasting for a month from July to August. Both the males and the females can mate more than once. Female receptivity is related to age and reproductive state: receptivity is less in both old and previously mated females. Neither the size nor the viability of cocoons is related to the number of female matings.

N2  - The fitness of Frontinella pyramitela (Walckenaer) (Araneae, Linyphiidae) is, by definition, a function of its lifetime fecundity and the survivorship of its offspring. In the present study, I sought the major determinants of fecundity in a laboratory setting and then evaluated the results in the context of several published field studies. According to this analysis, the primary determinants are female longevity, foraging success, and size. The data also permitted the calculation of an expected relative contribution to total fecundity of each clutch of eggs: because the fertility rate drops sharply after the second clutch is deposited, early mortality is disproportionately detrimental to lifetime fecundity.

N2  - The ovariuterus of Urodacus armatus had three types of diverticula, Rudimentary (RD), Embryonic (ED) and Post Partum (PPD). The data suggested that all the ova were developed and enclosed in RDs by the time a female reached maturity and that the sum of the diverticula gave a measure of the potential lifetime fecundity. Samples from two populations in two consecutive years were not significantly different and the combined mean for all diverticula was 56.7 &#177; 8.22. Annual fecundity (number of EDs) did not differ between populations or years and the combined mean was 8.3 (range 4-12).

N2  - The courtship of Thelechoris karschi, an African funnelweb mygalomorph spider, consists of an early non-contact phase of vibratory signaling and then a contact phase involving leg-fencing and, sometimes, lunging. Eventually the male clasps the female's pedipalps with his first tibial apophyses, tilts her upwards and backwards, and attempts to insert his palpal organs alternately. There was much variation among successful courtships in the amount of aggression (lunging and chasing). Mating was characterized by numerous bouts of unsuccessful palpal insertation attempts, relatively few successful insertations, and a tendency for repeated courtships and copulations. It is pointed out that ample opportunity for sexual selection by female choice exists during these courtships and copulation attempts, and that the lengthy and repeated copulations may be, in part, a consequence of genital anatomy.

N2  - Amino acid composition of major ampullate gland silk (dragline) produced by the mature, female golden orb-weaving spider, Nephila clavipes was determined. Several solvents were applied in order to solubilize the spider silk. Although several strong acids and bases were able to solubilize silk, the protein was apparently degraded by this treatment, as demonstrated by protein gel electrophoresis. Only a mixture of hydrochloric/propionic acid (50:50, v:v, final concentration 3N HCL/25% propionic acid) solubilized the silk while retaining the molecular weight integrity of the crystalline polymer. The results show that the major ampullate gland secretion is characterized by a high degree of small side chain amino acids (Ala, Gly, and Ser) and polar residues (Gly and Arg), comprising almost 75% of the total amino acids present. Contrary to published findings (Work and Young 1987), the composition of major ampullate gland silk appears to be uniform within the species. The composition of the secretion is discusse...

N2  - Interrelatedness among colony members and predation competence through cooperative foraging have been proposed as factors which act to maintain an atypically high level of social organization in the pseudoscorpion, Paratemnus elongatus. In this paper we report on two sets of field observations consistent with these hypotheses: 1) female-bias in sex ratio, and 2) the ability of P. elongatus to capture unusually large, heavily-armored prey. Cooperative foraging behavior enables this pseudoscorpion to exploit ant prey (Cephalotes atratus) thirty times it own mass.

Genetic differentiation among populations was weak (mean &lt;tex-math&gt;${\rm F}_{{\rm ST}}=0.116$&lt;/tex-math&gt;; Nei's unbiased D &#8804; 0.015); this may be attributable to the recency of introduction and opportunities for gene flow afforded by the affinity of these spiders for urban habitats.

N2  - An apparent outbreak of Hymenoepimecis sp., a heretofore unknown ectoparasite of the giant orb weaver, Nephila clavipes is documented in Panama during 1984-1985. Parasitism was highest (25-30%) among intermediate-sized, juvenile female spiders. During the second year the wasps became less discriminating in selecting host spiders. Female wasps were significantly larger than males, and the size of the wasp ectoparasite was positively correlated with the size of the host spider. Although intermediate-sized females that had males in their webs were less likely to be parasitized than such females without males, results from an insectary experiment showed that male spiders did not prevent an established wasp larva from killing its host.

N2  - The postembryonic development of spinning organs of Nuctenea cornuta (Clerck) and Neoscona theisi (Walckenaer) (Araneae, Araneidae), was studied with SEM, emphasizing first appearance of, and increase in, spigot and fusule complements. Our results suggest that these species may renew their spinning fields by two distinct methods during their ontogeny: spigots may be merely molted in situ like any other cuticular appendage; and/or spigots in one position are lost and &quot;replaced&quot; by an apparently new spigot in a new position. Some or all of each class of fusule (aciniform and pyriform) as well as major and minor ampullate spigots are replaced as well as merely molted. Flagelliform and aggregate spigots seem to be merely molted, never replaced. Evidence for these modes of replacement are the apparently vestigial spinning structures that persist from the previous instar, termed &quot;nubbins&quot; in the case of spigots, and &quot;tartipores&quot; in the case of fusules, as well as patterns in the increase in numbers of fusules a...

N2  - This study investigated the life cycle and behavior of Argyrodes ululans which is a specialist kleptoparasite in the communal webs of its social spider host, Anelosimus eximius. Observations of natural and enclosed colonies of An. eximius revealed that large An. eximius colonies maintain steady populations of high numbers of differently aged Ar. ululans individuals whereas small colonies contain fewer kleptoparasites less predictably. Adult female Ar. ululans forage almost exclusively by stealing newly captured prey directly from their hosts and were never observed to prey on host spiders. Although male and juvenile Ar. ululans will sometimes steal prey from An. eximius, they tend to scavenge more and feed on prey scraps abandoned by their hosts.

Both males and females of S. stridulans are very similar to males and females of S. ocreata and S. rovneri in coloration and genitalia, but are significantly smaller in carapace length and width. Mature males of S. stridulans lack a distinctive tuft of bristles on the tibia of the first pair of legs (present in mature males of S. ocreata, absent in mature males of S. rovneri); however, the tibia, patella and the distal 1/3 to 1/2 of the femur of legs I of males of S. stridulans are darkly pigmented. S. stridulans is found in mesic uplands leaf litter from Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Ohio, Missouri, Mississippi, and Alabama, and sometimes co-occurs with S. ocreata. Male palps and female epigyna are figured for S. stridulans and for S. rovneri for the first time.

N2  - Morphometric and nest position variables were used to examine the effects of spider growth and seasonality on webs and websites of the desert widow spider, Latrodectus revivensis Shulov (Theridiidae) in the Negev desert of Israel. The form of the web was similar over the full range of spider body sizes. All morphometric variables had strong positive correlations with spider size: larger spiders occupied larger nests in larger shrubs. However, nest characteristics were more highly correlated with spider size than were website characteristics. When the effect of spider size was removed by regression, more than 75% of the remaining variance consisted of correlated variation in three groups of variables relating to (1) website characteristics (48%), (2) nest characteristics (18%) and (3) capture web placement (12%). Most nest and website variables showed effects of seasonality that were independent of spider size, and may be related to the thermal regime in the nest. The results indicate that the relative qua...

N2  - A population of the burrowing wolf spider Geolycosa turricola in Mississippi was monitored over a period of 4 years. Weekly censuses of the number of burrows that were active, open but not active, or inactive were taken. The timing of the dispersal of spiderlings was examined by use of caging experiments. A habitat manipulation experiment was used to assess burrow site preferences. This population reproduced on a 2-year cycle; no young were produced in even years. The results suggest that some dispersing spiderlings construct burrows immediately after leaving their mother's burrow while others overwinter and build their first burrow during the spring. Two dispersing groups are identified and are shown to have different survivorship properties. The importance of this dispersal strategy in terms of subsocial behavior is discussed.

N2  - Mysmenopsis furtiva, a tiny spider which lives in the funnelwebs of the Jamaican diplurid spider, Ischnothele xera, behaves both as a kleptoparasite and as a commensal; it pilfers portions of its host's prey and also captures and consumes minute insects which are trapped in the host web and unnoticed or ignored by the host. Mysmenopsis furtiva is able to ingest hemolymph from its host's prey at a much faster rate than it can ingest material from the insects it captures. Two of its stealth strategies are to move not at all or slowly when the host is motionless and to synchronize its rapid movements with host movements. The host's anti-kleptoparasite behaviors suggest that the kleptoparasite has a significant negative impact on the host.

N2  - Development and reproduction of the red grass spider, Florinda coccinea (Hentz), from South Carolina were studied under laboratory conditions (26 &#177; 2 &#176;C). Both males and females required five molts to reach maturity, although 10% of the males had one supernumerary molt. Once mature, females lived approximately one month, or nearly twice as long as males. Laboratory-reared females produced as many as six fertile egg sacs, whereas field-collected females produced up to ten sacs. The first sac of laboratory-reared females had the largest average clutch size - about 70 eggs. The reproductive capacity of females mated with unmated males versus those mated with previously mated males was not significantly different.

Although sample sizes were small, the GOT-1 locus showed a tendency toward deviation from the expected inheritance pattern. Nonconformance to genetic expectations may be due to multiple-mating, to selection effects from laboratory rearing conditions, or to genetic drift.

N2  - During some of the intervals between bouts of pheromone-stimulated courtship display, isolated male Rabidosa rabida (Araneae, Lycosidae) perform a single pivot. In an investigation of the control of this turning behavior, males were tested under four conditions. Two of these were visual, a uniform environment or one with images, and two were non-visual, all eyes occulded or dim red lighting. The turning angle and the tendency to change the direction of turning were measured for the first three conditions, and no significant differences were found. This suggests that the turns are controlled idiothetically. Another parameter, the tendency to perform the turns, was reduced under dim red light but not in blinded spiders under white light, the latter suggesting the occurrence of extraocular photoreception.

N2  - The Hawaiian archipelago is well known for some of the most spectacular species radiations from single ancestors, although the occurrence of this phenomenon in spiders remains largely undocumented. The present study introduces the radiation of the highly diverse spider genus Tetragnatha in Hawaii. Preliminary studies indicate that the Hawaiian Tetragnatha can be divided into distinct clades, and this paper describes representatives of the Spiny Leg clade. These species are characterized by the many, robust spines on their legs, and the abandonment of web-building activity. There are 12 species in this clade, ten of which are new and described in this paper: T. tantalus n. sp., T. polychromata n. sp., T. brevignatha n. sp., T. macracantha n. sp., T. waikamoi n. sp. and T. kauaiensis Simon (in the Green Spiny Legs group), T. kamakou n. sp. and T. perreirai n. sp.

N2  - A region of mitochondrial DNA coding for most of the third domain of the 12S rRNA of the ribosomal small subunit has been sequenced from two spiders in the genus Tetragnatha (Araneae, Tetragnathidae): a circumtropical species T. mandibulata and an endemic Hawaiian species T. hawaiensis. The secondary structure of the spider ribosomal RNA shows strong similarity to that of insects. Across this region, the two Tetragnatha sequences are 22% different. The T. mandibulata sequence is 36% different from the homologous segment in Drosophila yakuba and 51% different from the same segment in Homo sapiens. The spider sequences are sufficiently variable to be useful in studying genetic relationships among at least some of the species in this genus.

N2  - The temporal pattern of activity and spatial distribution of six species of nocturnal orb-weaving spiders (Araneae: Araneidae and Tetragnathidae) were examined in coastal hedge vegetation in Israel. In Autumn, small spiders of all species built their webs early in the evening and progressively larger spiders put their webs up through the night. This activity pattern corresponded to the change in sizes of flying insects throughout the night. There was no interspecific segregation in time of activity. Spiders were highly clumped in space, but showed interspecific segregation only in web height. In Autumn, Nuctenea suspicax was the most abundant species, while in Spring Singa lucina predominated. During the latter season, spiders had two periods of activity: evening (at dusk) and morning (pre-dawn). Morning-active spiders had larger webs and larger clutches than evening-active spiders. As in Autumn, there was little interspecific segregation in time of activity or in spatial distribution. Spider removal expe...

N2  - Four species of Metaphidippus (Araneae: Salticidae) occupied different habitat types in Minnesota; M. arizonensis was found exclusively in sand prairie; M. flavipedes was almost completely restricted to conifers; M. insignis primarily inhabited open, non-canopy vegetation (e.g., grasslands); whereas, M. protervus occupied most habitats, but most evidently shaded forest understory and wetlands. Reasons for such habitat partitioning are conjectural. Size differences among the four species probably were not ecologically significant based on Dyar's constant; however, competition for prey may have influenced habitat selection.

N2  - To document variation in several developmental parameters and the effect of this variation on female adult size and fecundity, marked individuals were followed in three disjunct populations of the widely distributed spider Nephila clavipes (Araneae: Tetragnathidae). The sites chosen had very different physical and biological conditions which were expected to affect the development of the animals. Several developmental parameters were very plastic, such as weight gain and number of juvenile instars, varying both among and within populations. In contrast, two important developmental parameters, growth per molt and pre-molt weight, were constrained within each population but differed between tropical and temperate conditions. Constraining growth per molt established a developmental trajectory, and variation of its slope and of the number of juvenile instars were the primary causes of variation in adult female size and the correlated variation in the fecundity per egg sac. /// Para explorar la variaci&#243;n en pa...

N2  - Ballooning, the aerial displacement of a spider caused by friction between air and the spider with its silk, has considerable ecological importance but remains poorly understood as a mechanical process. The studies reported here provide insight into the mechanics of ballooning by way of experiments involving (1) stroboscopic measurement of the rates of fall of spiders slowed by known lengths of silk and (2) direct measurement of the drag generated by moving air at the surface of spiders as those spiders change their postures. The terminal velocities of spiders trailing silk, derived from their rates of fall at known distances from release, were remarkably variable. The variability could not be attributed entirely to silk length and spider mass, and in some cases silk length was not even statistically correlated with terminal velocity. Drag measurements made on living spiders revealed that the variability in terminal velocities could be explained by variability in posture.

N2  - The available material of the species Roncus lubricus L. Koch, 1873, from North America and South Europe has been studied. It was concluded that specimens of R. lubricus from the United States belong to the nominal subspecies. Furthermore, it is assumed that the USA populations of this subspecies were probably introduced by human activity. A new subspecies, R. lubricus pannonius, from Yugoslavia is described. A key to the subspecies of R. lubricus is presented. An analysis of the available type material from the collection of J. Had&#382;i has supported the elevation of two of his subspecies to full specific rank: Roncus tenuis Had&#382;i, 1933, new status, and R. dalmatinus Had&#382;i, 1933, new status, both from northern Dalmatia, Yugoslavia. These two species were formerly regarded as subspecies of R. lubricus, but this study revealed that they are not members of the R. lubricus group (since they both lack microsetae proximal to eb and esb). Both species are considered endemics to the Balkan Peninsula. Most diagnosti...

N2  - The life history and habitat preference of the wolf spider Gladicosa pulchra were investigated in several populations in Mississippi. Gladicosa pulchra has a one year life cycle with spiders changing from forest floor to tree trunk habitats in late summer or early fall. During the fall, spiders were found almost exclusively on trees (93% of observed spiders in 1989 and 80% of observed spiders in 1990). Males were observed to inhabit trees earlier in the year than females. Spiders did not climb trees smaller than 2 cm in diameter at breast height. Most individuals were collected at heights less than 2.5 m, and spiders were primarily oriented face down while on trees. The role that environmental factors play in this animal's habitat preference is discussed.

N2  - I systematically sampled, by pitfall trap, spiders in three different but nearly contiguous fens (Seep, Prairie and Forested) as well as those in the surrounding habitat (Oak-hickory forest) in southern Missouri. Samples were taken biweekly from May through August. Fifty-five species of cursorial spiders were found, of these, 17 occurred only within one or more of the fens and not in the surrounding habitat. All habitats, and particularly fens, were dominated by wolf spiders. Jaccard's similarity coefficient showed spider faunas of the Seep and Prairie fens were more similar to one another than to that of the Forested fen. While both Seep and Forested fen habitats harbored spider species quite different from the surrounding Oak-hickory forest, many species from the Forested fen were also found in the Oak-hickory habitat (56.3%). Abundances of spiders were greatest in May and declined through summer in all habitats, except the Seep fen in which abundances remained fairly constant. Tests of interspecific as...

N2  - No correlation was found between the web angle and the directional web orientation (in relation to the sun) for the orb webs of Leucauge regnyi in the Luquillo Forest of Puerto Rico. These data suggest that the web angle of L. regnyi is not a thermoregulatory response. In addition, prey capture efficiency of sticky traps placed at the mean angle of webs of L. regnyi is compared with traps placed at vertical and horizontal orientations in three sites in this tropical forest. Prey captured in sticky traps indicate a trend of prey availability in this ecosystem: vertically oriented traps catch fewer prey than horizontal traps or traps at the mean angle of web orientations; at sites of little or intermediate ecological disturbance, mean angle orientations catch more prey than horizontal orientations. Although confirmation that traps and spiders capture the same types of prey is lacking, it may be that in this tropical forest system, more prey are made available to spiders with horizontal and nearly horizontal...

In the first experiment, from 20 June to 9 September 1978, I augmented prey abundance in two plots interspersed within four control plots; at the end of the experiment the mean number of spiders was 2.7 times higher in prey-augmented plots than in control plots, and the difference was highly significant (P = 0.005). In the second experiment, from 25 June to 16 September 1979, I augmented prey abundance in one plot located in between two control plots; at the end of the experiment the number of spiders was &gt; 3.0 times higher in the prey-augmented plot than in each control plot. Although numbers of spiders in the 1979 experiment could not be analyzed statistically because the treatment was not replicated, they support the results of the 1978 experiment.

N2  - Observations from previous studies have indicated that lycosid spiders often die before maturing when raised on only one prey type. Two wolf spider species (Lycosa helluo collected from Florida, and Lycosa sp. collected from Kentucky) were used to test the hypothesis that diet affects survivorship. Siblings from one egg sac of each species were divided into two groups of 50 spiderlings each, and reared under identical conditions with different diets. The polytypic diet consisted of crickets (Acheta domesticus), fly grubs (Sarcophaga bullata), cockroaches (Periplaneta americana), mealworms (Tenebrio molitor), beetles (Dermestes sp.), and an occasional supplemental orthopteran collected from the field. The monotypic diet consisted only of crickets (A. domesticus).

N2  - The golden silk spider, Nephila clavipes (L.), is known to live both solitarily and in single-species aggregations. In Veracruz, Mexico, N. clavipes is also found in association with the colonial orbweaver Metepeira incrassata F.O. Pickard-Cambridge (Araneae: Araneidae). This study compared the frequency of predation attempts on solitary, intraspecifically aggregated and colony associated N. clavipes. Solitary N. clavipes suffered greater relative predation than those in single-species groups or those associated with M. incrassata colonies. We also compared the distance at which the three categories of N. clavipes were able to detect and respond to a simulated predation attempt. Both intraspecifically grouped and colony associated N. clavipes had significantly greater response distances than did solitary individuals, indicating that they could respond to a predation threat sooner. These data support predictions that grouped spiders may benefit from lower predation and/or an early warning system.

However, those placed on nearby goldenrod (Solidago spp.) flowers remained significantly longer, sometimes hunting, before dropping lower in the vegetation. They seldom ballooned from either site. Xysticus dispersal behavior differs markedly from that of the thomisid Misumena vatia, a flower-inhabiting species, which balloons regularly from leaves and remains much longer on goldenrod flowers than Xysticus.

N2  - The courtship behavior of the semi-aquatic Pisaurid fishing spider Dolomedes fimbriatus was examined in the laboratory. Male courtship was triggered by the presence of female drag-lines, presumably by a female sex pheromone since males did not respond with courtship to male drag-lines. Male courtship behavior included vibratory signaling (water surface waves), leg-waving, and following female drag-lines. Vibratory signaling was a major courtship component, and signals were produced at a regular rate (mean rate: 8.33 &#177; 1.53 s, n = 97). Irrespective of whether females were mated or unmated, females were very aggressive towards males, and sexual cannibalism prior to copulation occurred in 6.6% of the female attacks on males (n = 76). The capture success rate of females depended on whether the male was attacked from a distance or from immediate proximity. The occurrence of sexual cannibalism of courting males by virgin Dolomedes females is discussed, and it is suggested that this behavior of fishing spiders m...

N2  - It was observed that the jumping spider Menemerus bivittatus lives on light surfaces as well as on dark surfaces, hunting prey which is lighter or darker than the surface the spider is on. From these observations arises the question about the brightness or contrast discrimination abilities of this spider. The orientation response was recorded for 14 spiders to a moving circular prey-stimulus varying from white, through grey, to black, against a white, grey or black background. When the stimulus was darker than the background, there was a rapid increase in response as the stimulus gets darker. This rapid change in response with stimulus brightness did not occur when the stimulus was lighter than the background. These results reveal a high contrast discrimination ability and also a dependence of the response on the overall stimulation conditions.

N2  - Endogenous biological rhythms are apparently found in all eukaryotic organisms. The most ubiquitous of these, the circadian rhythm, functions to synchronize physiology and behavior with diel changes in the environment. Data presented here demonstrate that, in the linyphiid spider Frontinella pyramitela (Walckenaer) and in the theridiid spider Argyrodes trigonum (Hentz), a circadian rhythm modulates locomotor activity in some individuals but not in others. The data also show (a) that higher-frequency endogenous rhythms play a part in determining the patterns of motor activity, and (b) that intervals between bouts of activity are influenced by aperiodic processes that appear to be stochastic.

N2  - Predation by spiders on ground-released adult screwworms, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Coquerel), was studied near Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico, during 13 August 1984-23 January 1985. Observations of predatory behavior and manual collections of spiders during September provided the majority of the data. Species in 12 genera of spiders were confirmed as predators of screwworm flies. Nephila clavipes, Eriophora ravilla, Neoscona oaxacensis and Leucauge spp. were the most important predators. Spiders caused an estimated 4.5% mortality to flies in a &lt;tex-math&gt;$2250\ {\rm m}^{3}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; area during September. Capture of screwworm flies in webs up to 10 m above ground suggests the need to investigate the importance of forest canopies in screwworm ecology.

N2  - A large and dense population of over 500 burrows of Atypoides riversi in a 2.0 &#215; 3.2 m area was monitored for two years to indirectly determine demographics, growth rates, survivorship and longevity of the spiders. Twelve size classes of spiders were designated by correlating spider size to burrow size. All size classes were present simultaneously throughout the year. Variable growth rates were recorded for spiders in each size class, and survivorship was lowest for spiders in the smallest size classes. It is estimated, based in large part on growth rates, that A. riversi can live at least 16 years in the field.

The average number of eggs per sac was 161.5; the average egg diameter was 22 mm. The spiders were monitored in the laboratory to determine the inter-instar rate of growth. Eggs held in paraffin and carboxymethyl-cellulose developed only to gastrula. Under laboratory conditions, spiders did not build complete egg sacs, and the eggs were eaten. Several egg sacs were destroyed by fungus and parasitoids. The time of emergence of the spiderlings after oviposition was between 23 and 27 days. The reproduction period occurred between April and October and was apparently related to rain and relative humidity. The spiders have little parental care of the eggs and spiderlings. /// De los 50 ejemplares de Linothele megatheloides (Raven), creciendo bajo condiciones de laboratorio, solamente 22 llegaron a la madurez sexual, luego de entre 10 y 11 mudas.

N2  - Overwintering egg cases of the black and yellow garden spider, Argiope aurantia Lucas (Araneae: Araneidae), were observed during the late winter and early spring of 1985, 1986, and 1987 in Washington County, Mississippi. Of 120 egg cases monitored in the field in 1985, only three remained undamaged by the period of peak spiderling emergence in May. An additional 115 field-collected egg cases were observed in the laboratory in 1985.

N2  - Some females of the funnel-web spider, Agelena limbata multiply mate. After copulation, males make a visible copulatory plug which covers the female's genital opening. I assessed the effect of copulatory plugs on the fertilization success of second males, by conducting double mating experiments, using fertile and sterilized males in sequence. When females copulated with only one fertile male, more than 90% of their eggs were fertilized. Some males deposited complete plugs and others incomplete plugs. The relative size of the males to females and absolute male size affected the completeness of plugs. Complete plugs prevented another male's insemination completely, but incomplete plugs allowed insemination by second males. In general, first males had higher fertilization success than second or later males, and copulatory plugs enhanced the first male's advantage.

N2  - Scorpions sometimes capture and crush prey with their pedipalps and do not use their sting to inject venom. Experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that sting use is selective, resulting in conservation of venom. Sting use in relation to prey size and activity was studied in two African scorpions, Parabuthus liosoma and P. pallidus. Restrictive use of the sting was observed in both species. Decreased use of the sting occurred with decreasing size/resistance of the prey. Also, prey were not stung immediately after being seized, but only after resisting capture. The scorpions did not sting non-resistant prey. These results support the notion that sting use depends upon the size, morphology and resistance of the prey as determined during initial interactions with the scorpion.

N2  - I examined habitat relationships and prey abundance to determine which (if either) of these factors was more important in determining the local density patterns of the Saint Andrew's Cross spider, Argiope keyserlingi Karsch. Focusing on the relationship between a predator and its prey distribution presupposes that prey capture rate is crucial to the biology of the predator. I also studied the influence of prey capture on survival, reproduction and behavior of A. keyserlingi as a test of this assumption. Reproduction of females was influenced by food availability under laboratory conditions. Survival was higher among individual females provided with supplemental food in a field experiment. Adult female A. keyserlingi moved less frequently when they were provided with supplemental food. Features of vegetation were correlated with patterns of spatial distribution of this spider. There was a highly significant correlation between spider density on the study plots and the density of the understory shrubs that ...

N2  - The large, orb-weaving spider Nephila clavipes is found in a diversity of habitats within a narrow latitudinal range in Mexico. This allowed nearly simultaneous study of post-embryonic development of six disjunct populations in dissimilar environments. A common-garden laboratory study utilizing juveniles collected in four sites reinforced the conclusions from the field. The developmental parameters influencing growth in size at ecdysis did not vary within or among populations and may be genetically determined. Although very small juveniles exhibit variation in the growth per ecdysis, larger juveniles exhibit very little variation. These data, compared to data from field and laboratory studies of other tropical populations of N. clavipes, indicate that growth per ecdysis is highly constrained. Thus, this developmental parameter establishes a developmental trajectory that may be genetically determined and therefore subject to natural selection. /// La ara&#241;a Nephila clavipes, tejedora de telas orbiculares, s...

N2  - The neotropical spider Aebutina binotata Simon (Dictynidae?), previously known from a few museum specimens, was discovered to live in colonies and to exhibit highly cooperative behaviors that would classify it as non-territorial, permanently social. Colonies of this species, that contained from 14-106 adult females plus their offspring, were observed in a tropical rainforest site in Eastern Ecuador. The spiders occupied communal nests in which they cooperated in prey capture and fed communally on the prey. Large prey items were moved to the feeding site by the coordinated effort of two or three individuals. The spiders periodically carried out web maintenance activities; but when widespread damage to the nest occurred, they moved as a group to a new location. Care of the brood appeared to be communal since the offspring from different mothers intermixed in the colonies and were all cared for by a decreasing number of surviving females. Adult females participated most heavily in all the activities of the c...

N2  - Mitochondrial DNA fragments comprising more than 400 bases of the 16S rDNA from nine spider species have been sequenced: Cupiennius salei, C. getazi, C. coccineus and Phoneutria boliviensis (Ctenidae), Pisaura mirabilis, Dolomedes fimbriatus (Pisauridae), Pardosa agrestis (Lycosidae), Clubiona pallidula (Clubionidae) and Ryuthela nishihirai (syn. Heptathela nishihirai; Heptathelidae: Mesothelae). Sequence divergence ranges from 3-4% among Cupiennius species and up to 36% in pairwise comparisons of the more distantly related spider DNAs. Maximally parsimonious gene trees based on these sequences indicate that Phoneutria and Cupiennius are the most distantly related species of the examined Lycosoidea. The monophyly of the family Ctenidae is therefore doubted; and a revision of the family, which should include DNA-data, is needed.

N2  - Adult specimens of Kaira are rarely collected and the females are difficult to separate. The few specimens in collections represent 14 species, all American. Five species are new: Kaira cobimcha from southern Brazil; K. dianae from southeastern Peru; K. erwini from Peru; K. shinguito from northern Peru; K. tulua from Depto. Valle, Colombia. The female of K. hiteae is described and Araneus sexta is transferred to Kaira. Haliger is a new synonym of Kaira, with H. corniferus a synonym of K. altiventer. Kaira obtusa and Wagneriana minutissima are synonyms of K. gibberosa. Doubtful synonyms are Caira capra of K. altiventer, and Macpos monstrosus of K. gibberosa.

N2  - The spider family Trechaleidae, introduced by Simon in 1898 but abandoned immediately thereafter, is defined. Characters proposed for trechaleids by recent authors for this family and some characters used to separate it from the Pisauridae and Lycosidae are reviewed. Genera included in the family Trechaleidae, all of which were previously placed in the Pisauridae, are: Trechalea, Hesydrus, Syntrechalea, Dossenus, Paradossenus, Dyrines and Enna. Familial placement of all other genera of the western hemisphere previously placed in the Pisauridae are considered. The genus Trechalea, with eleven species, is revised. Redescriptions of eight known species are given: T. longitarsis (C. L. Koch), T. cezariana Mello-Leit&#227;o, T. macconnelli Pocock, T. paucispina di Caporiacco, T. connexa (O.

N2  - Experiments were conducted to study changes in brain amine concentrations during postembryonic development in the solpugid, Eremobates palpisetulosus. Data presented here indicate that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) levels increase during development whereas N-acetyldopamine (NADA) levels were found to decrease. 5-HT levels showed a significant increase between the first and second nymphal instars whereas DA increased significantly after the second nymphal instar stage. Octopamine levels did not change as a function of development in this solpugid. These represent the first data available on changes in brain amines as a function of development for any arachnid. It is suggested that such neurochemical changes may play a role in the regulation of shifts in behavior associated with specific developmental stages.

N2  - Orb-web weaving spiders synthesize and use a variety of silks, each having different properties suited to their particular functions. Three of these silks were collected from two different species of spiders and subjected to physical/mechanical testing. The major ampullate (dragline), minor ampullate, and cocoon silks of both Nephila clavipes and Araneus gemmoides were load tested on an Instron Universal test frame to compare their physical properties. The single fibers of major, minor, and cocoon silk of Nephila appear to be more elastic than that of Araneus. Araneus silks, on the other hand, appear to be stronger, requiring a higher stress to break the fiber than that of Nephila.

N2  - The diameters of axial fibers that support the cribellar threads of uloborids are shown by electron microscopy to be related to web architecture. Cribellar threads produced by the simple-web species Miagrammopes animotus and M. sp. are supported by the radial threads along which they are deposited. The axial fibers of these threads have smaller diameters than those of the self-supporting cribellar threads that are deposited between radial threads by members of the orb-weaving species Octonoba sinensis, Siratoba referena, and Uloborus glomosus and the triangle web-species Hyptiotes cavatus. Among these six species, axial fiber diameter is directly related to the maximum distance that a cribellar thread spans in the web. However, in O. sinensis and H. cavatus there is no intraweb difference in the diameters of axial fibers from short and long cribellar thread spans.

N2  - A scanning electron microscope study of the silk spigots of the first free postembryonic instar of Antrodiaetus unicolor shows that their spigots and setae are more similar in early instar spiderlings than in the adult spiders. This ontogenetic evidence supports the hypothesis that the silk spigots of spiders evolved from setae. These observations also suggest that spigots with a deep articulation between the base and shaft are more primitive than the non-articulated spigots.

N2  - We studied the seasonal occurrence of forest-floor spiders by collecting samples with 100 pitfall traps operated throughout the growing season of 1985 in a mature coniferous stand in southern Finland. Samples were collected at five-day intervals in May-August and at longer intervals in September-November. The entire sample from the 26 trapping periods consisted of 6753 adult spiders of 100 species. The overall abundance and species richness was highest in the early season, May and June. Seasonal spider catch was not correlated with fluctuations in temperature, but was negatively correlated with rainfall. Nine of the ten abundant species (&#8805;2% of the sample each) belonged to the family Linyphiidae (sensu lato) and one to the family Agelenidae. Macrargus rufus (Wider) was the most abundant species comprising approximately 1/3 of the sample followed by Lepthyphantes alacris (Blackwall) (17% of the sample).

N2  - The population structure of three large species of the genus Cupiennius was evaluated. Although solitary, 45% of C. coccineus, 40% of C. salei and 30% of C. getazi spiders were found on plants together with one or more conspecifics. The adult sex ratio (males: females) was 1:1.2 for C. salei (1989, n = 52), 1:1.3 for C. coccineus (1990, n = 75) and 1:1.6 for C. getazi (1990, n = 29). The ratio of adults: immatures was 1:0.5 for C. salei, 1:1.8 for C. coccineus and 1:13 for C. getazi. The two sympatric species, C. coccineus and C. getazi, sometimes occur on the same plants and are therefore considered syntopic. In all three species spider density is correlated with the number of the retreats offered by their dwelling plants. We found up to 0.2 adults/plant for C. salei and 0.3 adults per plant for C. coccineus and C. getazi. Cupiennius spiders, particularly the males, change their dwelling plants quite often. On average, C. salei males could only be found for 0.5 day on the same plant without interruption ...

N2  - Game theory predicts that resource value and fighting ability should affect the cost of fighting. I tested these predictions in the field with the pholcid spider Holocnemus pluchei, a facultatively group-living spider. Three species of prey were tested: fruit flies, house flies, and damselflies. Larger prey species required more time to subdue, but still represented resources of greater value because of their high caloric content. Fights were increasingly more common with increasing size of prey species. However, prey species did not significantly affect the intensity of fights, in contrast to predictions from game theory. Fights were most intense between individuals of the same size, as predicted by game theory. Holocnemus spiders do not appear to benefit from interactions with conspecifics in group webs.

N2  - Males of the dimorphic jumping spider, Maevia inclemens differ in both morphology and courtship behavior. Transition matrix analysis was conducted to determine what differences in male behavior and female receptivity were statistically significant. While males are both morphologically and behaviorally distinct, there was a high degree of overlap in the courtship sequences. The primary difference between males was the standing posture used by the tufted morph to attract female attention from a distance and the prone posture used by the gray male at close proximity to the female. When these behaviors were included in the analysis as separate behaviors, there was a significant difference between transition matrices for the male morphs. However, when these behaviors were combined and called &quot;Phase I courtship&quot; there were no significant differences between the morphs nor in the female responses to male behavior.

N2  - Twenty-nine colonies of a population of the cooperative spider Stegodyphus sarasinorum Karsch (Eresidae), from two sites in Bangalore, Karnataka State, India, were examined using protein allozyme electrophoresis. Thirty-five enzyme systems were examined. Twenty-two enzymes (the products of 25 putative loci) gave scorable results. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) were polymorphic with two alleles each; hexokinase exhibited uninterpretable variation. The rest were monomorphic. One LDH allele was found at only one of two collection sites, and one G6PDH allele was found only at the other collection site. The pattern of variation in S. sarasinorum is similar to that found in three other studies of cooperative spiders: extreme population subdivision, with most colonies consisting of identical homozygotes.

Mean numbers of spiders per sample were approximately equal by pitfall (x&#772; = 15) and sweepnet (x&#772; = 16) methods. Individuals of the Lycosidae (42.6%), Thomisidae (16.2%), and Salticidae (14.4%) comprised almost three-fourths of all spiders collected. Individuals of 13 other families were also collected.

N2  - Our objectives were to determine if Dolomedes triton from two populations, one with fish predators and one without, differed in growth and survival. Using a 2 &#215; 2 randomized block design, equal numbers of spiders were reared over a six-week period in artificial pools in the presence and absence of a natural predator, the bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, (Perciformes: Centrarchidae). Neither spider body size nor spider survival differed between populations. Survival of spiders in pools with fish was not significantly different from spiders in fishless pools. However, spider body size was significantly smaller in pools containing fish compared to spiders in pools without fish. No significant interaction between population source and the presence of fish was detected. We suggest two mechanisms for the reduction in spider body size: interference (i. e., avoidance of fish) and exploitative competition with fish for food resources. The reduction in spider body size is important because of the relationship...

N2  - The effect of micro-habitat change, caused by needle-loss, on spiders living in spruce (Picea abies) was examined in a field experiment. Abundance and size distribution of spiders on spruce branches were recorded at the start and at the end of the experiment. All spiders and approximately 24% of the needles were removed from the experimental branches. In the control branches, the needle density was left unaltered but the spiders were removed. There were no initial differences in the spider community on the selected branches. Spiders were collected after seven weeks of colonization on control and needle-thinned branches, respectively. The mean density of spiders was significantly lower on needle-thinned branches (78%) than on control branches. This was shown to be an effect of reduced density of large (length &#8805;2.5 mm) spiders, but not of small (&#8804;2.5 mm) ones. However, the total size distributions did not differ between the branch categories. The field experimental data confirm earlier results in laboratory...

N2  - In coastal Maine the crab spider Misumena vatia produces a single brood of eggs, but incipient signs of double-broodedness occasionally appear: 1) hunting after guarding nest of first brood; 2) apparent laying of second brood by artificially provisioned individuals during an unusually warm summer; 3) and occasional production of second nests without eggs, accompanied by guarding. To determine whether these spiders are capable of producing a successful second brood, I provisioned adult females to enhance early laying of a first brood, removed them from their brood after 10 days, mated half of them a second time, and then provisioned them all again. Nearly two-thirds laid a second brood, whose success did not differ from that of unmanipulated Misumena first broods in the study area. Numbers of remated and non-remated females producing young did not differ, indicating that remating is not necessary for a successful second brood. However, five broods of nonremated spiders had low hatching success, suggesting ...

N2  - Two groups of copulating pairs were observed, compared and analyzed. Ten copulations occurred in group A at cool environmental temperatures (mean = 16.2 &#176;C). In group B, 10 copulations occurred at warm environmental temperatures (mean = 27.7 &#176;C). Mean copulation duration of group A was longer than that of group B. However, both papal insertion and papal alternation numbers did not show any statistical differences between the groups. Temporal distribution of the papal insertions, as well as the alternations in the use of each palp, showed differences in frequency and pattern when comparing the two groups. A high level of stereotypy of the copulatory behavior of Lycosa malitiosa was confirmed, together with the inverse correlation between duration and environmental temperature. The decision whether to switch from one palp to the other might be affected by temperature-influenced local factors, such as the viscosity of spermatic fluid and/or muscular fatigue in the palp.

N2  - Members of a guild of cursorial spiders (Pardosa spp. and Alopecosa spp.) spatially segregate among five discrete habitats, ranging from a streamside cobble habitat extending laterally along a successional gradient to the leaf litter zone of a transition or climax high elevation (2348 m) riparian coniferous forest in Colorado. Seasonal activity peaked in midsummer for all guild members. Spiders were diurnally active earlier in streamside habitats, and levels of activity were positively correlated with light intensity. Guild members Pardosa tristis and P. uncata were most different in habitat selection and periods of diurnal activity. Males and females of all guild species differed in their distribution among habitats and over months of collection. Measures of guild species diversity and evenness were variable between habitats, and were largely influenced by the relatively high abundance of one or two guild species, particularly in the streamside habitats.

N2  - The antrodiaetid trapdoor spider genus Aliatypus is found in a wide range of elevations and habitats, nearly all of which experience the summer drought characteristic of the California Mediterranean climate. All eleven species prefer sheltered, stable, and sloping ground surfaces. Burrows tend to be clustered, sometimes very densely, in favorable sites and are often side-by-side with those of non-congeneric mygalomorphs. Burrows penetrate more or less perpendicular to the ground surface plane, are usually more nearly horizontal and slightly wider at the upper and lower ends, and are lined with silk and a packed soil casing. The shape of the wafer-type trapdoor is relatively constant within each species and differs markedly from one species group to another. Aliatypus trapdoor construction behavior differs from the collar-door construction behavior of Antrodiaetus only by a simple orientation rule. Entrance sealing with silk or silk plus soil plugs is common in at least some species during the dry summer. ...

N2  - Juvenile individuals of the spider species, Philoponella republicana, were common in the webs of the social spider, Anelosimus eximius, and the solitary spider, Architis sp., in the forest habitats of the SE Peru. The abundance, size and location of P. republicana individuals were surveyed in each host web. Although the host webs were similar in size and conformation, more P. republicana individuals were found in the social spider webs than in the solitary host webs. Likewise, the number of P. republicana in the social spider webs was correlated with host web size. The mean size of prey captured by P. republicana was 2.1 mm, which was significantly smaller than the prey taken by the social spider, and, in feeding trials, Architis sp. individuals reacted only infrequently to prey of that size. This separation in the size of prey taken caused us to conclude that P. republicana acted as a commensal for the most part; however, they were observed to prey on the social spiders occasionally.

N2  - A simple modification of classical optimal foraging models yields explicit predictions of the allocation of resources to orb-web synthesis and weight gain in a spider. Because the spiders may be trying to avoid weight loss, weight gain and web size are predicted to be be negatively correlated at higher food levels and positively correlated at lower food levels. These predictions were upheld qualitatively by experiments involving juvenile Nephila clavipes and N. maculata. /// Una sincilla modificaci&#243;n a los modelos cl&#225;sicos del forrajeo &#243;ptimo da predicciones expl&#237;citas sobre la repartici&#243;n de recursos entre el sintesis de la tela orbicular y el aumento de peso en una ara&#241;a.

N2  - The central-marginal model proposes marginal populations contain a lower density of individuals, lower levels of genetic variation, and are more isolated than populations in the center of a species range. Previous tests of the model used Drosophila, organisms capable of extended dispersal. We test the central-marginal model with scorpions, organisms with restricted dispersal abilities. We measured genetic variation through allozyme analysis of eight loci (five polymorphic, three monomorphic) to obtain estimates of heterozygosity. We compared differences between the two types of populations with a split-plot ANOVA. We also compared central and marginal populations using standard parametric tests. We found marginal populations contain lower genetic variation than central populations. These populations may be important as models in conservation to study the effects of fragmentation.

In census studies of five field plots I document mean relocation rates of up to 3.2% per day. The smaller size/age classes made up the majority of the relocating spiders. I found that individual spiders had their burrows closed on 26 &#177; 7% of census days. These burrow closures lasted an average of 6.8 &#177; 0.3 days, with 10% of burrow closures lasting longer than 14 days.

N2  - During the mid-autumn of 1993 and spring through summer of 1994, I sampled tallgrass prairie in northeastern Kansas to determine habitat use, distribution and population dynamics of the ant-like jumping spider Sarinda hentzi (Banks). This species was not detected in any censused area of tallgrass prairie until early October 1993, when large juvenile specimens were found in a density of &lt;tex-math&gt;$0.54\ \text{individuals}/{\rm m}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; on inflorescences of Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash.) in a biennially burned watershed. During the following spring, &lt;tex-math&gt;$0.6\ \text{adults}/{\rm m}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; were found on Indian grass panicles in a four-year burned watershed and &lt;tex-math&gt;$0.4\ \text{adults}/{\rm m}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; were located on Indian grass inflorescences in another biennially burned watershed. By mid-summer 1994, this species was no longer found on Indian grass and only very small juveniles were found on various Carex and Juncus species at the margins of wetlands.

N2  - Linyphiid spiders were tested individually in the laboratory in order to assess possible factors stimulating the onset of ballooning behavior. An air flow chamber was used for many of the tests. Air movement was found to be an important stimulus for initiating both the climb to a prominent position and subsequent take-off attempts. After instigation of pre-flight behavior by an initial air flow stimulus, climbing continued in still air, though take-off attempts generally ceased in the absence of further air movement. Neither circadian rhythmicity nor darkness were found to prevent exhibition of ballooning behavior at night. Length of time spent attempting to take-off appeared to be a factor in reducing a spider's response to the stimuli causing ballooning behavior.

N2  - Penultimate-instar crab spiders Misumena vatia foraging on goldenrod Solidago spp. in late summer gained mass slowly, averaging 0.8 mg/day, and usually did not molt into the adult stage before the end of the summer. In contrast, adults gained mass rapidly at this site, averaging 8.8 mg/day, taking larger prey and taking them more often than penultimates. The penultimates' prey consisted primarily of small flies, bees and wasps, and overlapped broadly with those of the adults, but did not include the most important resource of the adults, bumble bees, upon which the adults registered most of their gain. Penultimates captured prey biomass at only one-tenth the rate of the adults, and one-third the rate of adults per unit body mass.

It is readily diagnosed by its smaller body size, mottled color pattern, the shape of the female pectinal basal piece, and the shape of the male telson and subaculear tubercle. Two new species related to C. thorelli are also described, one from the lowlands of Guatemala and the other from mountainous areas in southern Tamaulipas and northern San Luis Potosi in Mexico.

N2  - Specific locality records are presented to define the distributions of the scorpions Centruroides vittatus (Say) and C. hentzi (Banks) in North America. The former occurs in the Central Plains as far north as Thayer County, Nebraska; the Rio Grande and Sangre de Cristo Mountains form the western distributional boundary, and the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers essentially do likewise on the east. Centruroides vittatus occurs just across the latter watercourses in Holt County, Missouri, and Monroe and Randolph counties, Illinois, range extensions that probably can be attributed to rafting or natural alterations in the rivers' courses. Other occurrences east of the Mississippi River, in northern Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi and North Carolina, are associated with cities and are mostly far outside what we consider the natural range; such records are regarded as human introductions. One of these apparently represents a viable reproducing population in Rutherford County, Tennessee. Like...

N2  - Spiders of the genus Lutica are fossorial inhabitants of coastal dunes of southern California, Baja California and the California Channel Islands. They live in silk-lined burrows concentrated beneath dune vegetation. Lutica are sit-and-wait predators that subdue insects that walk near or over burrows. They are sedentary and do not engage in aerial dispersal via ballooning. Adult males abandon their burrows during the late summer and early fall to wander in search of females. Females produce eggsacs and guard them till they die; spiderlings emerge in the spring. Dune trapdoor spiders (Aptostichus simus) prey on Lutica, while the larvae of a therevid fly are external parasites.

These forms may be synonymous, representing male/female or juvenile/adult dimorphs, but the two species are retained at present. A new reconstruction of Lissomartus schucherti is presented. A new family, Lissomartidae, is proposed for these species based on a combination of their lack of opisthosomal tuberculation and their opisthosomal segmentation pattern of tergites 2 + 3 fused and tergite 9 divided into median and lateral plates. Lissomartidae new family may be intermediate between Trigonotarbidae and Eophrynidae + Aphantomartidae.

N2  - The wolf spider Pardosa lapidicina Emerton 1885 occupies cobble beaches above the tide line about Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, and migrates back and forth with the tides. To my knowledge this is the first explicit report of such behavior in a spider. The species is common, attaining densities of over 30 individuals/0.5 m of shoreline. The spiders are confined to the beach from April until November, and 33% or more of the population moves back and forth with diurnal tides during clear or warm weather. Individuals may migrate on one day but remain above the tide line on the next. Small numbers remain on the highest part of the beach through most or all of the winter; others retire into the adjacent coastal scrub. Spiders occupy both stretches of open beach and beach with fringing salt-marsh grass (Spartina alterniflora) beds. Those in the latter habitat do not migrate through Spartina after it has reached high density in June, remaining confined to the upper reaches of the beach. Numbers of P. lapid...

We collected 1252 individuals, with 199 species represented. Some species were year-round residents of mailboxes while others appeared only during limited periods of time. Species typically found in the foliage of coniferous trees and on the trunks of pines and oaks dominated the collections, with lesser numbers from other types of habitats. The species observed are divided into categories depending upon their consistency in terms of time of occurrence and number. Species that occurred only rarely tended to be different from year to year.

N2  - Spiders from a total of 24 genera and eight families that possessed prey were collected using direct observation and sweep sampling during a survey of seven stands of wild (four sites) and abandoned (three sites) cranberry bogs in Massachusetts. Over all sites, 7009 spiders were inspected and 2.7% of all individuals possessed prey. At the wild bogs, Lycosidae and Araneidae were most commonly collected and at the abandoned bogs, Oxyopidae and Tetragnathidae were most common. A total of 11 orders of prey was observed and small Diptera (39.4% of total) (particularly Chironimidae), Collembola (18.6%), Homoptera (11.7%) (particularly Cicadellidae), and small Hymenoptera (9%) were the most common prey items.

The first row of eyes is formed by two anterior lateral (ALE), two posterior median (PME) and two anterior median eyes (AME). Two posterior lateral eyes (PLE) point backwards and form the second row of eyes. This study used the histological staining technique of Hematoxylin-Eosin and Mallory-Azan-Heindenhain. The specimens were fixed with Bouin, using n-Butyl alcohol as an intermediary for embedding in Paraplast. Frontal, transversal and sagittal sections (6-10 &#956;m) were made. The cornea and lens of all the eyes are cuticular and laminar. Behind the lens there is a layer of cone cells with projections toward the lens.

N2  - Argyrodes trigonum (Hentz 1850) can interact with its host as kleptoparasite, host predator, web-stealer, or commensal. This species can also capture insect prey in a web of its own construction. Which foraging strategy an individual A. trigonum exhibits certainly depends on a multitude of environmental factors, especially host availability. In this study, field surveys of populations of A. trigonum and its hosts and daily observations of individually marked host webs were made at sites in Ohio and New Hampshire. These observations together with a manipulation of A. trigonum density were performed in order to determine the influence of host species and abundance on the foraging strategy of A. trigonum. A. trigonum utilized Neriene radiata (Walckenaer 1841) to a greater extent than alternative hosts at both web sites even though many other host species were more abundant.

N2  - The pholcid spider, Crossopriza lyoni (Blackwall 1867) is a common inhabitant of homes in a rural village in Chachoengsao Province, Thailand. Studies on the spider were initiated because its microhabitat closely coincided with that of adult Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus 1762), mosquito vectors of dengue virus. Laboratory observations showed that females deposited eggs 4-6 days after copulation. Females held the egg sac in their mouthparts for 11-13 days, until all spiderlings (mean = 34) had left the sac. Spiderlings did not feed until they had molted, but as soon as feeding commenced they were capable of overpowering a mosquito many times their own size. Sometimes spiderlings would share a single mosquito or eat a mosquito wrapped by the mother spider. Spiderlings separated from their mother grew more rapidly than those left with the mother and reached maturity in as little as 74 days. The spiders' principal means of capturing prey was to throw silk with the aid of the hind legs. Spiders used this method to im...

N2  - The wolf spider, Schizocosa avida (Walckenaer 1838) can utilize leg autotomy to successfully avoid capture by the scorpion, Centruroides vittatus (Say 1821). Leg autotomy was used successfully in 7 out of 43 encounters with a scorpion (16%). Spiders were captured and eaten by scorpions in 79% of the encounters. Two spiders (5%) escaped capture by means other than leg autotomy. Scorpions most often grasped spiders at their abdomen (49%), followed by the cephalothorax (35%) and leg (16%). Naive spiders (no previous experience with a scorpion), with intact legs or an autotomized leg, spent significantly more time (26-32 min out of a 60-min trial) on a filter paper disc that had come into previous contact with a scorpion as compared to spiders that had lost a leg in a successful escape from an encounter with the predator (10 min). This is an example of associative avoidance learning and is the first demonstration of this type of learning in response to previous experience with a predator in spiders.

N2  - The harvestman genus Togwoteeus Roewer 1952 is monotypic. Its only species, T. biceps (Thorell 1877), is known from throughout western Canada and USA and is newly recorded from California, Nebraska, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota, and Utah. This species occurs below 500 m and at the highest elevation (4100 m) of any recorded harvestman in North America. It ranges from about 33-54&#176; N and exhibits considerable variation in its morphological measurements. Twenty-seven such measurements are summarized for 80 males and 74 females. Ultrastructural details of the integument, appendages and genital organs are presented. The karyotype is 2n = 22 for both sexes. All chromosomes are metacentric and obvious sex chromosomes were not detected. Immature T. biceps overwinter and reach adulthood in late spring or early summer. Adults die by late fall.

N2  - Various authors have offered three alternative hypotheses of phylogeny which suggest different sister groups to the orb-weaving spider genus Metepeira. In one case Kaira is sister genus to Metepeira, and Zygiella is sister to Kaira plus Metepeira; in another case, Kaira is sister genus to Metepeira, but Zygiella is a tetragnathid, and thus unrelated at this level of analysis; and in the last case, Zygiella is close to Metepeira, but this time Kaira is not closely related. To resolve among these conflicting hypotheses, six species of orb-weaving spiders were sequenced for mitochondrial DNA encoding a portion of the 12S ribosomal subunit. These data were analyzed with data from two tetragnathid orb-weavers to estimate the phylogenetic relationships among these spiders and to determine which genus is a likely sister group to Metepeira. Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony supports the hypothesis that Kaira is a likely sister group to Metepeira and that Zygiella is in the family Araneidae rather than the fam...

N2  - Members of the family Vaejovidae are the dominant species of scorpion in much of western North America, yet relatively little is known of the life histories in this group. In this paper I present data on growth rates of a single litter of Pseudouroctonus reddelli, a troglophilic vaejovid from central Texas. From an initial litter of 53 juveniles, one individual reached instar 8. Nearly 75% of this litter died during instar 2 or 3; this mortality rate was quite high, but consistent with other laboratory studies on vaejovid growth. A comparison with adults from this population suggested that P. reddelli mature at instar 9 for both males and females. Progression factors for two morphological measures during the early instars were more often below the predicted theoretical value of 1.26, while the progression factor for mass was close to the theoretical value of 2.0. No sexual dimorphism in growth rates was observed for instars 2-4. In comparison with other vaejovids, P. reddelli has a larger litter size, sho...

N2  - Orb-webs constructed by the superfamilies Deinopoidea and Araneoidea share a common architecture, but differ in both their orientation and the type of capture thread that they contain. This study uses transformational analyses to determine which web features these clades share and which features are unique to the Araneoidea and may be associated with changes in web orientation and capture thread composition. It examines relationships among spider weight, the cross sectional area of capture thread axial fibers, and features of orb-web architecture in four species of the Family Uloboridae that construct horizontal orb-webs containing cribellar thread and four araneoid species that construct vertical webs containing adhesive capture thread. In both groups, spider weight was positively related to web area and the number of radii in a web were positively related to the number of spirals. In uloborids, weight was negatively related to the number of spirals per web area and axial fiber cross sectional area was p...

N2  - We examine copulatory behavior and the reproductive natural history of the spiny orbweaver, Micrathena gracilis. Censuses were conducted on free-ranging, individually marked spiders. After molting to adulthood, males induct sperm into their palps and then search for mates. Females inhabit solitary, individually-constructed webs. Males preferentially remain with penultimate-instar females, those about to molt and mate for the first time. After a female molts and constructs a viscid spiral, males build mating threads on which they court. After copulating, the male must dismount and reapproach the female to inseminate her second reproductive tract. Two copulations are therefore required for a complete mating between male and female. Some males, however, obtained only one copulation and two males often copulated with a given female. Staged encounters in the field revealed the important observation that when a male did copulate twice with a female, the duration of the second copulation was more than twice as l...

N2  - The diversity of sperm transfer behavior shown by water mites (Acari, Hydrachnidia) is among the highest in the Arthropoda. However, sperm transfer has been described in fewer than 10% of water mite genera, all of them being Holarctic or cosmopolitan taxa. Here I describe mating behavior in Physolimnesia australis (Halik 1940), the sole representative of an Australian genus. P. australis is unusual in having larvae that do not parasitize insects, and in including rotifers in its diet. The highly dimorphic P. australis male responds to female presence by taking up an &quot;embrace&quot; posture in which he orients his opisthosoma and legs III toward approaching females. The female is caught in the embrace and her legs IV are secured by the modified tips of the male's legs IV. The male deposits a glutinous mass on the female's back, which she grooms towards her genital opening after being released. This mode of transfer differs from members of the confamilial genus Limnesia Koch 1836 in which males and females do not...

N2  - The effects of prey capture on web site tenacity and survivorship of Argiope trifasciata (Araneae, Araneidae) were studied in two old field habitats in southwestern Ohio. Adult females were studied in habitats dominated by grass or thistle plants. In manipulation plots, we added two crickets to the webs of approximately half the spiders. We were able to quantify differences in prey intake using morphological measurements that changed with food consumption. The spiders that did not receive supplemental food were similar in size to unmanipulated spiders in other areas that we censused. No differences were observed in survivorship or web site tenacity of spiders in grass vs. thistle habitats. No difference in survivorship was observed between fed spiders and those left to natural prey capture. However, spiders receiving supplemental prey relocated their webs less frequently than those spiders that were unsupplemented.

N2  - The buthid scorpion Compsobuthus matthiesseni (Birula 1905) is redescribed (male lectotype here designated), based on study of type specimens and other material now available. Its placement in the genus Compsobuthus Vachon 1949 is discussed, and it is regarded as a valid species of the C. acutecarinatus group despite possessing some unique features. In particular, its elongated pedipalps and metasoma serve to readily distinguish it from other Compsobuthus thus far known in the region. Compsobuthus matthiesseni is known from a number of localities in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. Some details of the early collections made in southwestern Asia are provided.

N2  - Encounters and effects of predators were examined for group-living and solitary dispersers of the spider Stegodyphus dumicola Pocock 1898 (family Eresidae) in Namibia. Birds and araneophagous spiders were major predators of solitary spiders; group members living in large, tough, complex nests were less vulnerable. Arboreal pugnacious ants Anoplolepis steingroeveri (Forel 1894) frequently attacked S. dumicola colonies of all sizes. As a means of defense against ants, the spiders produced copious amounts of sticky cribellar silk. Solitary spiders were incapable of sustaining this resistance for as long as groups could and usually died when ants attacked. Solitary individuals were, however, less likely to contract a contagious fungal disease that spread in large, old nests after rain. I conclude that the action of predators may explain why S. dumicola tend to be avidly social as well as prudently solitary.

N2  - It has been hypothesized that larger females of the social neotropical spider Anelosimus eximius (Keyserling 1884) (family Theridiidae) take advantage of the food captured by smaller females, and thus maintain a higher social rank within a colony. To test this hypothesis, the behavior of adult females in three colonies of A. eximius was observed in the Panama rain forest. Adult spiders with low body weights did most of the building, cleaning and repairing of the communal web, while heavier spiders more often took care of egg sacs. The latter stayed mostly inside safe retreats while low-weight spiders were mostly outside the retreats, where mortality was high. Reproducing spiders were of high body weight. To test whether this behavioral asymmetry is related to the nutritional condition of a female a manipulation experiment was conducted. A comparison of adult females, which were either well fed or starved, showed that starved females do more web maintenance, spend more time outside the retreats and more of...

N2  - Goniosoma spelaeum (Mello-Leit&#227;o 1932), a cavernicolous species in the Ribeira Valley, southeastern Brazil, was studied in the field and laboratory. The defensive behaviors were: nipping with the chelicerae; delivery of a sharp pinch with the fourth coxae and femora; rapidly running away; dropping from the cave ceiling and remaining concealed against the substrate; and emission of a chemical defense compound. The delivery mechanisms of the defensive secretion were either by spreading the substance on its own body through a lateral groove, or by projecting it as a jet directly at the aggressor. The defensive substance is a mixture of enteric fluid, which runs from the mouth into ventral and lateral channels, with quinones collected from the scent gland openings located next to the lateral margins of coxae II. Electron microscope analysis of the external structure of the exocrine gland opening revealed a second aperture which could be responsible for the jet emission.

N2  - The relationship between body size and web design was studied for the nocturnal orb-weaving spider Nuctenea sclopetaria. Body measurements (carapace width, leg length, body length and wet weight) taken from 27 adult female and 22 juvenile spiders were related to web dimensions (capture area, number of radii, capture thread length, mesh height) each spider constructed. Carapace width was found to be the most reliable size measure for predicting web dimensions for adult and juvenile spiders. The study also found that the webs showed a distinct asymmetry due to the enlargement of the lower web half and the extent of this asymmetry increased with carapace width. Furthermore, mesh height increased with distance from the hub. The possible effects of web asymmetry on the prey capture success of spiders are discussed.

N2  - In this field study, I tested the insect-attraction hypothesis as one of the functions of stabilimenta spun by Cyclosa conica (Pallas 1772) by examining: (1) if stabilimentum-decorated webs trapped more insects, (2) if a larger web diameter was responsible for the higher insect-trapping rate in decorated webs and, (3) if the differential distribution of insects in spiders' habitats was responsible for the higher insect interception rates of decorated webs. The number of wrapped prey, web diameters and presence of stabilimenta was recorded daily from 13 web locations. The stabilimentum-decorated webs of C. conica trapped significantly more insects (150% more) than undecorated webs, but they had significantly smaller mean web diameter (19% smaller). Among web locations, there was no significant difference in their insect interception rates, whether the data were collected from decorated or undecorated webs. These results suggest that the higher insect-trapping efficiency of decorated webs spun by C. conica ...

A group of males whose genital pores were sealed with melted paraffin immediately after molting copulated once; then, the seal was removed, and later these males copulated again. A second group of males was untreated prior to their first copulation but then immediately had their genital pores sealed and subsequently were allowed to copulate again. Two other groups of males were used as controls: their genital pores were &quot;pseudosealed&quot; by having paraffin placed beside them.

Cupiennius remedius new species is the ninth species established for the genus. Like all other species of Cupiennius, C. remedius is a hunting spider living in close association with monocotyledonous plants where it hides in a retreat during the day and is active at night. C. remedius is of medium size (carapace length ca. 8 mm) compared to the other species of the genus and is the only Cupiennius species known to live sympatrically with C. salei. Live animals show a spotted coloration pattern unusual for the genus. The distinctive features of the male bulbi and female epigyna are described and an example is given of the species-specific courtship vibrations.

A range of vegetation variables was also recorded from each field. We identified 56 species of spiders from 8609 individuals in our study samples. Most species caught belong to the Linyphiidae, with especially high captures of Oedothorax spp., Erigone spp., Lepthyphantes tenuis (Blackwall 1852), Bathyphantes gracilis (Blackwall 1841) and Meioneta rurestris (C.L. Koch 1836). The Lycosidae were also well represented by Pardosa and Trochosa spp., although the samples were largely dominated by the presence of Pardosa palustris (Linnaeus 1758). More spiders, and more species of spiders, were captured from organic than from conventional fields. Principal Component Analyses suggested that the spider communities differed between the contrasting systems.

N2  - The significance of habitat structure and prey availability in spider biology has been well investigated in a number of communities, but only briefly in forest canopies. This study gathered indirect evidence for the importance of these two factors as determinants of spider abundance and diversity in arboreal communities of western Oregon. Arthropods were collected by harvesting and bagging tips (1 m long) of lower crown branches from red alder (Alnus rubra), western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), noble fir (Abies procera) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii). Several characteristics of arthropod habitats were measured: tree diameter at breast height, maximum horizontal and vertical branch spread, number of branching angles and leaves, and total biomass of twigs and foliage. The highest numbers of spiders per branch were collected from structurally more complex tree species including Douglas-fir and noble fir. These tree species also had the highest spider species richne...

N2  - The goal of this research was to investigate the relationship between habitat structure and spider density in soybean fields managed under conservation tillage practices. Previous studies suggest that spiders respond to vegetational structure, and fields which are not tilled tend to have greater vegetational structure due to higher densities of weeds. Experimental subplots with varying densities of weeds (High, Medium, and Low weed) were established in soybean plots in southwestern Ohio. By the end of the season significantly more web spiders were found in treatments with higher weed densities. Across the season more than 87% of the spiders observed were orb-web weavers and sheet-web weavers. When considered separately, both of the common types of web spiders had higher densities in areas with higher densities of weeds. However, the degree to which orb and sheet-web weavers attached their webs to weeds differed across treatments. Orb-web weavers were more likely to attach their webs to weeds than to soybe...

Both species occur in sympatry in a subtropical humid lowland forest in Brazil and shared very similar life history traits such as univoltinism and slightly biased subadult sex ratios with more females per colony than males. Reproduction in A. jabaquara took place in early summer (December) and the brood developed during winter (April to October) under the care of females. But the reproductive periods in A. dubiosus and A. jabaquara were desynchronized by one month with A. dubiosus reaching maturity and mating in November.

N2  - Since adult male crab spiders Misumena vatia (Clerck 1757) (Thomisidae) feed sparingly and do not increase in mass, we wished to determine whether they responded to cues from hunting sites that would maximize their prospects of capturing prey. These spiders used cues from both prey and substrate as indicators of satisfactory hunting sites in the absence of females. They remained longer on red clover (Trifolium pratense) and ox-eye daisies (Chrysanthemum leucanthemum) in peak-condition flower than on senescent ones, and longer on daisies in peak-condition flower with prey than on peak-condition flowers without prey. They also remained as long on senescing daisies and clover with prey as on daisies and clover in peak-condition flower, but without prey. Thus, the effects of prey and substrate acted cumulatively on daisy, but not clover. However, they did not respond markedly differently on flowering and senescing branches of goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), although individuals on peak-condition flowers visi...

N2  - The arachnid order Opiliones has typically been divided into three suborders (Cyphophthalmi, Laniatores and Palpatores), but this system has been challenged in recent years. Based on scenarios of genitalic evolution, Martens and coworkers have argued that certain lineages within Palpatores are more closely related to Cyphophthalmi than to other palpatorean opilions and erected a new clade, Cyphopalpatores, to accommodate this proposal. However, this system is also problematic. Because most genitalic characters within Opiliones are unique to that order, genitalic characters cannot be polarized and opilion phylogeny cannot be rooted using objective outgroup comparison. Thus the Cyphopalpatores concept rests heavily on speculative scenarios of character evolution. The goal of the present study was to examine relationships among the major lineages of Opiliones using both genitalic and non-genitalic characters and thereby assess the Cyphopalpatores concept and associated scenarios of genitalic evolution.

N2  - Leg autotomy often confers immediate benefits on the animal losing its legs, such as escape from a predator, while costs are usually less obvious and accrue long after the leg is lost. I conducted a survey to determine the prevalence and characteristics of leg autotomy in two species of harvestmen, Leiobunum nigripes Weed 1892 and L. vittatum Say 1821, from May-December 1996 at Chicot State Park, Evangeline Parish, Louisiana. Nearly half of all individuals found were missing at least one leg. There was no significant difference in the median number of legs between months for L. nigripes, but differences were found among several months for L. vittatum. Either of the second legs was most likely to be lost in both species. These results indicate that leg autotomy is common in harvestmen. Furthermore, these results suggest that the second legs are not as crucial to the survival of harvestmen as previously believed. Leg autotomy may result in a reduction of potential fitness for individuals, but harvestmen may...

N2  - Spiders were collected from the forest floor surface using pitfall traps (cans and buckets) and funnel traps at 12 study sites selected to represent the sandhill community of north and central Florida. A total of 5236 spiders was collected, which included 23 families, 92 genera, and 154 species. The largest number of individuals (528) was collected at Orange City and the largest number of species (48) was collected at the most northern site, Suwannee River State Park. Species richness, abundance, similarity and seasonal variation were compared among the study sites. Lycosidae comprised 75.2% of the total number of spiders collected. Four species were collected at all 12 sites: the lycosids Lycosa ammophila, Schizocosa duplex, and S. segregata, and the salticid Habrocestum xerophilum. Eighty-three (53.9%) of the 154 species were collected at only one site.

N2  - A comprehensive study of the biology of Mecicobothrium thorelli Holmberg 1882 was carried out in the laboratory and in the field (Sierra de Animas, Maldonado, Uruguay). The species is found in shady riparian sites under trees. M. thorelli builds sheet-and-funnel webs under stones, logs, roots and in crevices. In the laboratory, developmental data indicated that the spiders have an inactive phase in summer and probably another in winter. Adults emerged in the fall and the males die during late winter. Three egg-clutches of about 30 eggs were observed in the laboratory at the end of winter and the beginning of spring (August-September). Juveniles emerged from one of the clutches 27 days after oviposition. A three-year lifespan was estimated. Males started courtship (body vibrations and palpal drumming) upon contacting the female web. Females showed high tolerance during the entire sexual interaction. An unusual clasping mechanism was observed before and during copulation: the female engaged her cheliceral f...

N2  - Trite planiceps Simon 1899, a common New Zealand jumping spider (Salticidae), lives in the cavities formed by rolled-up leaves of New Zealand flax (Phormium tenax) and similar plants. This study presents evidence that T. planiceps males use cues from females' draglines deposited on the outside of these rolled-up leaves when searching for females hidden from view inside. In choice tests, T. planiceps males preferentially associated with draglines deposited by conspecific females rather than areas lacking draglines. In contrast, females did not discriminate between areas with and without males' draglines and neither males nor females discriminated between areas with and without same-sex conspecifics' draglines. Additionally, T. planiceps males found openings and entered the cavities within rolled-up leaves occupied by females in nature sooner when leaves were tested within 24 hours of collecting (dragline cues deposited on leaves in nature) than after the same leaves had been cleaned and aged for seven days...

N2  - Metepeira incrassata (F.O. Pickard-Cambridge 1903) (Araneae, Araneidae) are colonial spiders that share a common and relatively permanent framework of silk, but that construct and defend individual orbs within the communal framework. Orbs are taken down nightly and replaced in the morning. Larger spiders generally begin orb construction before smaller spiders do. We tested whether this pattern results from interactions among spiders of different size classes. We constructed artificial colonies that contained either a mixture of size classes or a single size class. In two replicates, spiders that were housed in single-size groups built their orbs at the same time as their counterparts in mixed groups. We suggest that conspecific interaction is unlikely to be the only factor determining the differences in the timing of orb construction among size classes in this species.

N2  - The courtship behavior of male Leucauge mariana (Keyserling 1881) spiders that occurred both prior to and during copulation is described, along with the positions and movements of the male genitalia. The great variation in male behavior suggests that it does not function in species recognition. Several kinds of female response are necessary if a male is to successfully inseminate her. Males made two types of insertion, involving different movements of palpal sclerites, and copulations with virgin females differed quantitatively and qualitatively from those with non-virgins. Males deposited encapsulated sperm and other material in an outer chamber of the female's spermatheca early in copulation. Later stages of copulation involved deposition of material on the surface of the female's epigynum that sometimes resulted, with the apparent addition of material by the female, in the formation of a plug on the epigynum. Sperm were decapsulated in the female soon after insemination, perhaps as a result of the acti...

N2  - Jumping spiders (Salticidae) are well known for their complex visual hunting behavior, but this is the first comparative study investigating their ability to catch prey in the absence of visual cues. When tested with vision occluded inside tubes, where spiders and prey (house flies, Musca domestica, and fruit flies, Drosophila spp.) could not easily evade each other, each of 42 salticid species tested caught prey in at least one of five different procedures used. Some salticids caught flies less frequently or were less aggressive when tested in petri dishes, where spiders and flies could easily evade each other. For both types of arena and prey, there were significant species differences in both success at prey-capture and tendency to respond aggressively when first contacted by flies. Additionally, there was significant positive correlation between success at catching prey and tendency to act aggressively when first contacted. Salticids resembled short-sighted spiders from other families by only attempti...

N2  - The first known fossil of the pseudoscorpion family Sternophoridae is described from Dominican amber. The specimen, an adult female, is tentatively assigned to the extant species Idiogaryops pumilus (Hoff), known from Florida and Little Cayman Island. The incomplete state of the fossil is probably the result of scavenging while the animal was trapped on the surface of the resin. The cuticular parts have collapsed during fossilization and the golden appearance of the fossil is due to light being reflected from the surface of the cast, rather than from the cuticle itself. A thin layer of cerotegument is recorded in Sternophoridae. The morphology of the coxal area is reinterpreted. The so-called pseudosternum is delimited by the apparent internal borders of the coxae, which have moved laterally. A Y-shaped canal runs from the openings of the coxal glands to the oral cavity, carrying their secretions, together with those of the accessory glands of the coxae, to the oral cavity. The canal is covered by a serie...

N2  - A new genus Anysrius is proposed for two new species from Tasmania, Australia: A. chamberlini (type species) and A. brochus. Anysrius represents the sister-genus to the northern hemisphere genus Syarinus Chamberlin, but males differ in differences in the morphology of sternite II and IV. The biogeographic aspects of the new discovery are examined, and the Syarinus-Anysrius clade is considered to represent an ancient relict which evolved prior to the breakup of Pangea during the Mesozoic. This distribution pattern is considered to be 'bipolar' and is compared with that of the pseudoscorpion family Pseudogarypidae, which is also known from Tasmania and the Holarctic.

N2  - The genus Attidops is resurrected from Ballus based on its strongly excavate cymbial tip, transverse embolar groove, flatter carapace with extended postocular area, and single retromarginal cheliceral tooth, which indicate a closer relationship to the genus Admestina. The type species, Ballus youngii Peckham &amp; Peckham 1888, again transferred, becomes Attidops youngi (Peckham &amp; Peckham). Two new species, Attidops nickersoni (sister species to A. youngi) and Attidops cutleri, are described. Icius cinctipes Banks 1900, previously transferred to Ballus, becomes a new combination, Attidops cinctipes (Banks). Lectotypes and paralectotypes are designated for Ballus youngii and Icius cinctipes. The genus is recorded from south-central Canada, eastern U.S. and eastern Mexico.

N2  - Carorita hiberna NEW COMBINATION, a species with many putative autapomorphies known from one sex and few specimens, is transferred from Sisicottus. This transfer is based on a modified version of a cladistic analysis of erigonine relationships by G. Hormiga which incorporated 43 spider taxa scored for 73 characters. The modified analysis features 46 taxa scored for 74 characters. The resulting cladogram placed C. hiberna sister to C. limnaea, the type species of Carorita. It is concluded that C. hiberna is better placed in Carorita than in either a new monotypic genus or in Sisicottus. Carorita hiberna is redescribed and the monophyly of Carorita as currently circumscribed is discussed.

N2  - The Dominican Republic amber fossil spider record is examined and hypotheses generated concerning the Recent Hispaniolan spider fauna which is, at present, poorly known. The families Cyrtaucheniidae, Microstigmatidae, Nemesiidae, Ochyroceratidae, Tetrablemmidae, Palpimanidae, Hersiliidae, Symphytognathidae s.l., Anapidae, Mysmenidae, and Hahniidae, known from the fossil, but not Recent, fauna are predicted to be components of the Recent fauna of Hispaniola. Based on a terrestrial invertebrate species longevity of less than ten million years, the presence of endemic and non-endemic species, and the assumption that Hispaniola has suffered no major ecological disruption that would cause the amber lineages to become extinct, the following hypotheses are made: Filistatidae and Desidae colonized Hispaniola after the Miocene amber formation; Drymusidae, Amaurobiidae, and Deinopidae were present on Hispaniola during the Tertiary, but avoided capture, or have yet to be found in the amber; and Scytodidae, Oecobiida...

N2  - The Hawaiian Thomisidae are noted for being extremely species rich, as well as diverse in morphology and ecology. This exceptional diversity led early systematists to place the species into several genera with cosmopolitan distributions. It has been recently suggested that these species compose a single large adaptive radiation. Species-area relationships for all thomisid species and for Misumenops F.O. Pickard-Cambridge 1900 (Thomisidae) species for various island areas were generated. Further, a phylogenetic hypothesis was constructed based on genetic distances between the Hawaiian thomisids and various outgroups using a 450 bp region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene to test for close genetic relationships. Despite the extraordinary isolation of the Hawaiian islands, the numbers of Misumenops and total thomisid species were found to be significantly higher than predicted for an island system of its size. Phylogenetic analysis of COI suggests the Hawaiian thomisids are more closely re...

N2  - The isolation of the Hawaiian archipelago has resulted in a fauna that shows high levels of endemism. I examined the role of lifestyle, as inferred from web-building versus non-web-building behavior, in dictating the rate of differentiation and species formation within a lineage of spiders in the genus Tetragnatha from the Hawaiian Islands. This genus comprises a group of morphologically, ecologically and behaviorally diverse taxa. Included in the radiation is a 'spiny-leg' clade which never builds webs and is relatively loosely associated with a specific habitat, and a large group of web-building species which are generally more tightly associated with a given substrate and habitat. Sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase DNA provided relative estimates of the age of a clade. Both linear and logarithmic models were used to estimate rates of speciation and the relative time required for speciation for each clade. The results showed that several small clades of web-building species have a greater rat...

N2  - Geological and morphological evidence suggests that the earliest scorpions were at least partially aquatic and that terrestrialization occurred within the scorpion clade. Scorpions and one or more other arachnid lineages are therefore likely to have come onto land independently. The phylogenetic position of scorpions remains controversial and we question Dromopoda, in which scorpions are placed derived within Arachnida, as this is not supported by scorpions' lateral eye rhabdomes, embryology and sperm morphology. We propose a synapomorphy for scorpions + eurypterids, a postabdomen of five segments as part of an opisthosoma of 13 segments. Scorpions and tetrapulmonates must have evolved their book lungs convergently while fossil evidence indicates that a stomotheca, synapomorphic for Dromopoda, is probably convergent too. 'Arachnid' characters such as Malpighian tubules, the absence of a carapace pleural margin, and an anteriorly directed mouth may also be convergent, although their status as synapomorphie...

N2  - Whip spiders use stalked spermatophores for sperm transfer. These are complex structures, and their morphology varies among genera and families. Usually, the paired sperm masses hidden within the spermatophores are small, and there has been a co-evolution of spermatophores and those parts of the female genitalia which are used to pick up the spermatozoa and to store spermatozoa. These are structures like specialized sclerotizations, glands or, in a few species, seminal receptacles which are hidden inside the genital atrium (or uterus externus). In most species there are paired erectile bodies, homologous to genital appendages, which are attached to the dorsal side of the genital operculum which also is part of an appendage homologon. All these structures vary among genera and families. The comparison of spermatophores and genitalia of different species belonging to most genera and families suggest that the female gonopods consist primarily of paired cushion-like structures, each equipped with a small fing...

N2  - The distinctive prolateral spination of the metatarsi and tibiae of the first two legs in Mimetus is obscure in the first post-eggsac eclosion instar. Only one of the small, acuminate tipped macrosetae appears in the first instar, small macroseta numbers increase in the second instar, and outnumber the large macrosetae by the third instar. The high variability in adult macroseta counts occurs in the third instar as well. The characteristic macrosetae have a socketed base and longitudinally grooved shafts. The large macrosetae are characterized by numbers of small pustules on the base below the emergence of the shaft and the tips of the macrosetae are round. The small macrosetae have fewer pustules or none, and the tips of the macrosetae are falcate and acuminate. Both the large and small macrosetae morphologically resemble presumptive mechano-receptive setae on the legs, and may have a sensory function.

N2  - The scanning electron microscope was used to examine embryos at a stage when booklungs and spiracles are forming. Earlier studies with scorpion fossils suggest there was ventral mesosomal transition from gills or booklungs above ventral plates to sternites, booklungs and spiracles. In Hadrurus arizonensis (Iuridae), ventral plates and then sternites are formed on the ventral surface of mesosomal segments before spiracles appear. Bilateral invaginations in body segments XII-XV apparently give rise to the booklungs, with spiracles formed lateral to the site of invagination. Sternites with bilateral depressions were also present before spiracles in embryos of the buthid Centruroides exilicauda. In the developmental stages herein examined, spiracles were formed in embryos of Paruroctonus mesaensis (Vaejovidae); but there was no indication of ventral plates or sternites on the ventral mesosoma. Spiracles appear in the intersegmental area posterior to body segments XIII-XV. Booklungs may form later from primord...

N2  - We tested the hypothesis that the respiratory system of hypogean spiders is subject to regressive evolution by examining representatives of the family Dysderidae. This comparison included the epigean species Dysdera ninnii Canestrini 1868, and Harpactea lepida (C.L. Koch 1838), and the hypogean species Stalita taenaria Schi&#246;dte 1847, and Parastalita stygia (Joseph 1882). Both tube tracheae and book lungs of these species were measured and compared using 10 indices. Both the tracheal system and book lungs of the hypogean species were less developed than those of the epigean ones. We suggest that the cause is reduction of the respiratory system as a part of general structural reductions in the troglobites. This is consistent with the lower respiratory rates that characterize many troglobites.

Parthenogenesis is based on the production of an all-female brood (thelytoky) by a wild virgin female. Conversely, the first probable case of male parthenogenesis (arrehnotoky) in scorpions is reported based on the production of two successive all-male broods by a wild caught virgin female of Tityus metuendus Pocock from Peru. Both species were found in isolated palm trees within the rain forest, conforming with the insular theory of parthenogenesis.

N2  - Tityus serrulatus Lutz &amp; Mello 1922 (in fact, the form confluenciata within the Tityus stigmurus complex) is an extremely toxic scorpion of considerable medical importance in Brazil. Its rapid spread is partially due to parthenogenesis. Speculation regarding the occurrence of sexual individuals has been resolved by the discovery of a population, described here, having a male-female sex ratio of 1/2.5. Four color morphs of the T. stigmurus complex are described, and it is concluded that T. serrulatus and Tityus lamottei Louren&#231;o 1981 are junior synonyms of T. stigmurus (Thorell 1877).

N2  - The activity rhythms, feeding behavior, and reaction to light of two epigean (surface inhabitant) species of harvestmen (Iporangaia pustulosa and Iguapeia melanocephala) and of one cavernicolous species (Pachylospeleus strinatii) have been recorded. Both the epigean and the cavernicolous species showed a highly pronounced circadian rhythmicity. The cave species showed a bimodal pattern. Whereas the epigean species carried food away to feed, the cave species fed where they found the food. The time of reaction to light did not differ statistically between species. However, when exposed to light, the cave species walked much longer distances after it started walking. These differences are probably due to cave adaptation. The cave species may have to wander further for food (and maybe mates) because of the scarcity of resources and, therefore, show greater activity and also a tendency to exploit a resource wherever they find it.

N2  - Courtship and mating behavior of Brachypelma klaasi, heretofore unknown, is described on the basis of three courtship and mating sequences, one in captivity and two in the field. Adult males perform courtship movements (pedipalp drumming, leg drumming, push-up and shaking) when they locate a female's burrow, probably in order to avoid female aggression. After some physical contact, the female raises the prosoma and extends her chelicerae. The male then grasps her chelicerae with his tibial apophyses and the female arches her body backwards leaving the epigynum exposed. The male starts boxing the female's sternum and presumably inserts his pedipalps and inseminates the female. In two cases the female vigorously attacked the male immediately after mating and probably would have killed him had observers not intervened; the other pair separated more slowly and peacefully. Males appear to use chemical and/or tactile cues from the female's silk around the burrow during short-range searching behavior. Males begi...

N2  - Second-instar crab spiderlings Misumena vatia (ca. 0.6 mg) that had never previously fed made killing attacks on pomace flies Drosophila melanogaster (ca. 1.0 mg) in direct proportion to the surface areas of the flies' body parts: abdomen, 50%; thorax, 29%; head, 20%. They retained this pattern over their next six encounters with these flies. They also attacked the different surfaces of these body parts (front, side, above, below, behind) with a frequency predicted by the respective areas of these surfaces. All of the spiderlings tested more than once successfully attacked prey on more than one body part. Fifth and sixth-instar Misumena (ca. 7-15 mg) attacked small (4 mg) syrphid flies Toxomerus marginatus more frequently on the head than the second instars attacked Drosophila heads. This difference may result from subsequent experience, greater activity of the syrphid flies than the Drosophila, or maturation of the spiders.

N2  - Sampling methods and times can misrepresent components of spider assemblages found in tree crops. I collected 2561 spiders, including 20 families, 77 genera and 140 species, from inland and coastal south-east Queensland citrus orchards maintained under Integrated Pest Management programs. Spider assemblages, collected diurnally and nocturnally using vacuum and pit-trap sampling methods over four seasonal periods (spring, summer, autumn and winter), were compared using Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices and Morisita-Horn similarity index. Significantly different spider assemblages were collected by the two sampling methods in all orchards and seasons. Nocturnal and diurnal sample data differed for spider abundance (similarity) and diversity for several orchards. These results indicate the need to conduct nocturnal and diurnal sampling using a combination of sampling methods to reduce misinterpretation of the composition of spider assemblages. Such misinterpretations may underestimate the predator...

N2  - The biogeography of the Gondwanan orbweaving spider Carepalxis is reviewed. The genus occurs in Central and northern South America, Australia and New Guinea. It is recorded for the first time from Western Australia. Mimicry of a gumnut (eucalypt seed capsule) is described and illustrated for a southwestern Australian species. It is postulated that the mimicry protects the spiders from bird predation.

N2  - Epigeic invertebrates such as spiders are of increasing importance for habitat characterization and for assessments within environmental plannings in Germany and other European countries. Due to high costs for spider sampling (e.g., with pitfall traps), proposals for a limited sampling effort are required for the practical use. The results of a two-year study with continuous sampling are compared to results of short-term sampling and to results of a reduced number of traps. The same data set is used for all evaluations. Decreasing sampling effort generally reduced the number of recorded species and led to a biased ecological characterization of the spider communities. Reducing the number of pitfall traps used provided a more representative sample than did reducing the duration of sampling. In general, errors based on reduced sampling were lower for agricultural than for natural habitats. These results offer practical use of spiders for bioindication in future environmental planning.

Seventy-seven species belonging to eleven families were caught. Linyphiidae (s. lat.) dominated both in species and individual numbers. The most common species were Lepthyphantes alacris, Agyneta ramosa, Lepthyphantes antroniensis, Centromerus arcanus and Agyneta subtilis. The fauna found is, in general, typical of old Finnish boreal forests.

N2  - There were 193 schizomids (hubbardids) collected from the soil (0-7 cm depth) during a 12 month study of a primary upland forest &lt;tex-math&gt;$37.5\pm 16.8\ {\rm ind}/{\rm m}^{2}/\text{month}$&lt;/tex-math&gt; near Manaus. They were represented by Surazomus brasiliensis (Kraus 1967) and an underscribed species of a new genus (96% and 4% of the total catch, respectively). About 68% of all specimens of S. brasiliensis inhabited the organic soil layer (0-3.5 cm depth) where monthly catches of juveniles were positively correlated with soil temperature. Females were twice as abundant as males. The lack of a distinct reproductive period and the presence of juveniles (in particular the first nymphal instar) and adults (both sexes) throughout the year indicate a plurivoltine mode of life. Few specimens were caught on the soil surface, and none were on tree trunks or in the canopy. Abundance of S. brasiliensis is compared to that of the Palpigradi (microwhip scorpions) and Thelyphonida (vinegaroons) from the same study site.

N2  - Ground-dwelling Linyphiidae from eight South Carolina inner coastal plain habitats were sampled for one year using pitfall traps. Habitats formed an age gradient, from a field disturbed yearly and pine stands aged 5, 25 and 40 years, to xeric, mesic and hydric hardwoods (50-75 years) and an oldgrowth forest (200 years). Sixteen of the 55 trapped species were represented in sufficient numbers (n adults &#8805; number of sampling periods, 26) to examine patterns of correlation between phenology and habitat distribution. Half of the species are multivoltine, characterized by adults present throughout the year, continuous reproduction, and overlapping generations. Adult abundance of these species peaked during spring through autumn. Other species were univoltine, with adults present briefly, indicating synchronous reproduction and non-overlapping generations. Adult abundance of these species always peaked during winter months. This study examines relationships between observed voltinism patterns and characteristic ...

N2  - Spiders found in and around buildings may be divided into three categories: 1) true synanthropes, which can establish breeding populations in houses, seldom occur locally in the natural environment, and have broad ranges because they may be accidentally transported to new locations, 2) spiders which are seasonally abundant in natural habitats as well as in houses, but don't establish breeding populations in houses, 3) spiders which are rarely found in houses because they are locally rare or spiders that are locally common but are rarely found indoors. Fifteen species, including the venomous Loxosceles relusa and Cheiracanthium mildei are true synanthropes in Kansas. Category 2 contains 26 species, including the venomous species Latrodectus hesperus, L. mactans, and L. variolus. There are 33 species which are rarely found indoors in Kansas. Most species listed have been reported from buildings across the United States.

N2  - Arachnid communities of alpine grassland, of screes and woodlands near the timberline and of the nival zone have been compared along a transect from the northern to the southern border of the Dolomites. The region is zoogeographically interesting because of differences of the ice cover during glaciation, which was less severe in the southern area. Along the whole transect spider communities in grasslands and at the timberline zone show approximately the same composition. Endemic species, e.g, Harpactea grisea (Canestrini 1868), Amaurobius ruffoi Thaler 1990, Coelotes mediocris Kulczynski 1887, Cybaeus intermedius Maurer 1992 and Eudasylobus ligusticus Roewer 1923 occur mostly on the southernmost station, which remained free of ice. Re-immigrants over short distance are scarce, e.g., Coelotes mediocris at Passo Rolle and Coelotes solitarius L. Koch 1868 in the Puez area. Endemic species were not found in the alpine grassland of the northern Dolomites, which suggests severe impact of glacial events on the l...

N2  - Pseudoscorpions (Chthonius ischnocheles (Hermann) and C. orthodactylus (Leach) sensu strictus) were collected using a D-Vac over two-years from 60 field margins at Oxford University farm at Wytham, U.K. Old and new grassland margins were subjected to six different treatments involving spraying, non-intervention and four different cutting intensities. Significantly more pseudoscorpions were found in old compared to new margins, suggesting they may be attracted to litter build-up over time. Pseudoscorpion numbers were reduced on treatments subjected to two cuts annually, particularly when a summer cut was included, although this effect was ameliorated when the cuttings were left. However, pseudoscorpions were most numerous on treatments which involved no management because of the increase in leaf litter which may replicate a woodland environment. Adjacent hedges appear to buffer the effects of management: margins with adjacent hedges (rather than ditches or tracks) having more individuals. In contrast to re...

N2  - Pitfall trapping was carried out in northern Hungarian winter wheat fields and their adjacent margins during the growing seasons of three consecutive years, 1992-1994. The dominant species of both habitats was the wolf spider Pardosa agrestis (Westring). A total of 8403 adult individuals of 19 families of 149 spider species was identified: 118 species from the winter wheat and 118 from the margins with fewer traps. The efficiency of detecting species by trapping was 90%, according to the Baule-Mitscherlich extrapolation model. Provided that the sampling effort is the same in both habitats, traps in the margin may catch higher number of individuals and species, than traps located within the field. Calculations, however, indicate that the field, with an area more than a hundred times larger than that of the margins, has a higher total number of species. Although the spider species spectrum of the field and of the margin had a considerable overlap, the Renkonen similarity index indicates that the spider faun...

N2  - Field margins are susceptible to agro-chemical spray drift, and the effects of herbicide on spiders in semi-natural habitats have been little studied. In this experiment, an arable field margin was sprayed with three rates of glyphosate (90 g active ingredient/hectare (a.i/ha), 180 g a.i./ha &amp; 360 g a.i./ha) and control plots left unsprayed. Spiders were sampled monthly (June-October) using a converted garden-vac and adult spiders were identified to species. A total of 23,393 spiders was sampled with the web-spinners representing more than 90% of the individuals. The effects of glyphosate application on the abundance of wandering and web-spinning prey-capture guilds, and the two most abundant species (Gonatium rubens and Lepthyphantes tenuis) were analyzed using ANOVA F tests. The highest rate of glyphosate consistently reduced the total number of spiders, the numbers of web-spinners, G. rubens and L. tenuis, but not numbers of wandering spiders.

N2  - The Balkan Peninsula is home to 1409 species, included in 337 genera and 47 families. This number was established after a critical review of the existing literature and taxonomic revision of some available collections containing spider material from this region. The highest number of species is recorded for the territories of Bulgaria (775), Greece (642), Croatia (615) and Serbia (508). This biodiversity depends not only on the size of the regions, but also on the degree of exploration by researchers. The territories of Albania, Turkey, Montenegro and Bosnia are less well investigated. According to their current distribution, the established 1409 species can be classified into 24 zoogeograpical categories, grouped into four complexes (widely distributed, European, Balkan endemics, and Mediterranean).

N2  - The ecological guild concept has been of great interest to arachnologists, and the different manner in which spiders forage for a common resource-prey arthropods-has led to numerous attempts to classify them into guilds. However, questions have been raised about the validity of guilds and the taxon-centered basis of their definition. Here, we propose an alternative approach to guild classification, using quantitative analysis of ecological characteristics of spider families. While generalizations may not apply to all species within a taxon, results from this approach suggest eight major spider guilds similar to earlier guild assignments by some authors and provide a reasonable framework for future studies. We used this classification in a comparison of spider guild composition across several major crops (from published studies). While total species richness varied widely among crops, the proportion of the total species within each guild was remarkably even across crops. The relative abundance of guilds (b...

N2  - The annual recolonization of many agroecosystems by spiders is accomplished more by aerial deposition of ballooning spiders than by cursorial invasion from refugia such as forests and fence lines. The resulting spider communities can have major direct impacts on prey populations and can therefore strongly influence crop productivity. In this paper I first review what we know about ballooning in the broad sense, and then explore the influence of localized atmospheric structure on the physics and dynamics of ballooning. I used relatively high frequency measurements of air movement (speed and inclination) to develop a statistical characterization of the aerial microclimate at the top of the canopy in a field dominated by goldenrod (Solidago sp.), and analyzed the known physics of ballooning in the context of that statistical characterization. The major findings are (1) that the spider's perception of the current state of its microclimate, at least with respect to air direction and speed, has almost no predic...

N2  - Ground and aerial populations of linyphiid spiders were sampled in and above a grass and a cereal field, weekly from June-August 1991. Aerial activity of immature, adult male and adult female spiders was significantly higher over the senescing cereal field than the grass field. Water-trap catches and wind-speed data were used to calculate indices of aerial activity to show differences in the timing of dispersal by adult male, female and immature spiders. Some aerial dispersal occurred every week with highest adult dispersal in July and highest immature dispersal in August. Aerial activity indices were higher for males than females, and the dispersal peak occurred earlier for males than females. Immatures dispersed from the cereal field in July and August, and from the grass field mainly in August. Differences in aerial activity are discussed with reference to dispersal strategies that might maximize spider survival in the patchy, disturbed agricultural landscape.

N2  - Although spiders in general are polyphagous, indiscriminate feeding is not advantageous because prey vary enormously in quality due to toxicity or nutrient deficiency. Active prey selection serves to find the optimal compromise between three &quot;nutritional goals&quot;: maximize energy intake, balance nutrient composition of the body, and minimize toxin consumption. Consumption of toxic prey is reduced by more or less specific induced aversions, probably associated with both prey taste and behavior. Spiders' ability to avoid toxic prey seems limited because aversions are short-lasting and some toxic prey do not induce an aversion. Such prey may be lethal. Toxic prey in a mixed diet may inhibit feeding on and utilization of good prey. Induced tolerance to toxic prey may be possible, however. Nutritional balance may be obtained through consumption of high-quality prey or through mixing of prey types. It is argued that nutrient balance is more important than maximization of energy intake for fitness.

N2  - Assemblages of spider species can make significant reductions in pest numbers that are of value to the farmer. A group of spider species with complementary niches leaves few refuges for the pest in space or time. Spiders usually exert an influence on pest numbers in concert with other natural enemies, and spiders are sometimes the dominant component. In addition to killing pests by direct attack, spiders cause pest mortality by dislodging them from plants or trapping them in webs. If the pest is distasteful, or if it is the dominant prey type available, spiders may kill more than they consume, which increases the rate of pest kill per unit of spider food demand. The implications for pest control, of various types of interaction between spiders and other natural enemies, are explored in this paper. Interactions with specialist natural enemies usually result in complementary effects, enhancing pest control. Specialists reduce the density of pests to levels where spiders can prevent resurgence.

N2  - In this article, an overview of the general feeding patterns of common agroecosystem spiders is presented. Five groups of web-weavers (Tetragnathidae, Araneidae, Theridiidae, Linyphiidae, Dictynidae) and five groups of hunters (small-sized Oxyopidae, large-sized Oxyopidae, Thomisidae, Salticidae, Lycosidae) are analyzed comparatively (based on 40 prey analyses previously published by various European and US authors). Fewer than 10 insect orders, as well as the order Araneae, make up the bulk of the prey of these spiders. Web-weavers and hunters both basically feed on the same prey orders, but in different proportions. The observed differences reflect in part the very diverse range of life styles and foraging modes exhibited by the various spider groups and, to some extent, differences in prey availability. Web-weavers are almost strictly insectivorous (insects constituting &gt; 99% of total prey). Hunters, however, exhibit a mixed strategy of insectivorous and araneophagic foraging patterns (insects constitu...

It is useful to consider how factors operate at three levels of a spatial hierarchy, namely micro-habitat, habitat and landscape. The size and distribution of spider populations are determined by factors influencing survival, reproduction and dispersal. Modes of dispersal vary in terms of the efficiency of sampling new habitats and the level of risk. A literature survey of proximal factors (micro-climate, habitat structure, disturbance, prey availability, predation, and territoriality) affecting micro-habitat usage by spiders showed that the relative importance of these factors varied according to spider species. Spider abundance and diversity were found, in general, to be positively correlated with environmental diversity at different spatial scales. Within-field habitat diversifications were found to be more effective in increasing spider populations wh...

N2  - Predation is of great ecological, evolutionary and behavioral interest. For our present purposes the primary reason for studying it is to determine the role of spiders in suppressing pest populations. Research approaches have included laboratory studies of preference, feeding rate, and fitness; direct observation of predation events or accumulations of prey carcasses; gut analysis; and field experiments. Laboratory studies provide some uniquely useful kinds of information but cannot give reliable indications of the &quot;biological control potential&quot; of spiders against a given pest. Direct observation can be powerful; it has provided the best data on dietary range and predation rates in the field. Gut analytical methods include the use of radionuclides, electrophoresis, chromatography and serology. Serological techniques are preferred: antibodies can be made specific down to the level of prey stage or instar, and assays are simple, sensitive, and reliable. They can determine the relative importance of differen...

N2  - Spider competition has long been an elusive phenomenon for ecological study. Because most spiders are generalist predators, they are predicted to overlap in resource use wherever they overlap in space use and activity periods. However, despite this obvious potential for competition, the empirical evidence for competition has been weak. Spider competition could potentially limit densities in agricultural ecosystems, which would limit their effectiveness as biological control agents. We summarize the results of five studies in a type of ecosystem which may be considered to be analogous to row crops in both the physiognomy of vegetation and cyclic disturbance regimes, namely, wetlands. In addition, we summarize the results of our own work in a soybean ecosystem.

N2  - Evidence is growing that spiders can be effective biological control agents, particulary assemblages of several species. Other evidence finds that spiders prey on each other and other generalist predators, and as such are of limited value in biological control. Such predatory interactions between species which use similar resources have been dubbed intraguild predation (IGP) due to their potential to modify competition as well as cause direct mortality. IGP interactions can have unexpected effects at other trophic levels, and sometimes result in enhancement of a pest population. In this paper I review the evidence for intraguild predation interactions involving spiders in natural systems, and other generalist predators in agroecosystems. To date not much research has examined whether such interactions influence spider biological control potential. Some suggestions as to how we might begin to address these issues are presented.

N2  - The involvement of spiders in decomposition food webs has the potential to affect agricultural productivity through two quite different types of interactions: (1) cascading, top-down effects of spider predation on rates of nutrient mineralization-spider-initiated trophic cascades in the detrital food web that could alter rates of decomposition and release of nutrients to plants; and (2) a bottom-up linkage, through spiders, between decomposition and grazing food webs-energy from the detrital web contributing to elevated spider densities, which in turn might reduce pests and enhance net primary production. Scant experimental evidence exists to refute or support either hypothesis. The first set of interactions is most likely to be of significance in no-till and conservation tillage farming. In theory, spiders have the potential to enhance productivity by increasing rates of mineralization, but theory also predicts that spiders, by preying on important detritivores and fungivores, depress rates of litter dec...

N2  - The density and diversity of the spider community has been closely tied to the structural complexity of the local environment. For instance, soil dwelling spiders increase dramatically when the litter layer is enhanced because there are more retreats and hiding places and because temperature and humidity extremes are moderated. Web-building spiders are directly linked to the configuration of the vegetation because of specific web attachment requirements. Both correlative and experimental data support a tight relationship between spider density and habitat structure. Most of the available data show that agricultural practices which enhance the structural complexity of the environment (such as intercropping, mulching, and conservation tillage practices) enhance the density and diversity of the spider community. The key question regarding spiders in agroecosystems is, of course, whether they are in any way suppressing the activity of herbivores. Some studies uncovered a strong link between habitat complexity...

N2  - A general individual-based model of spiders in agricultural land was constructed. The populations of spiders were simulated on landscapes which were defined from a set of landscape descriptors based on a Danish agricultural landscape. These descriptors gave the types of habitats present in the landscape together with their area and a frequency distribution of the size of individual habitat patches. The agricultural land was divided into crop types each with its own array of crop managements which were considered to influence the spiders via mortality. The dimensions of the model are relatively large, with the spider population able to grow to a size of one million individuals and with a spatial resolution of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; landscape units. The effect of altering the spatial organization of the landscape elements was investigated together with the influence of the size of fields in the agricultural landscape. Results showed that the spatial arrangement of landscape elements did not affect spider population...

N2  - We can identify agricultural systems in which spiders might best be applied in pest suppression from study of the mechanisms by which spider populations influence prey in natural ecosystems. Theory predicts that prey control is achieved through the development of a stable interaction between predator and prey populations. Two models have been applied to predator control of prey, limit cycle and equilibrium point or focal control. Limit cycle control is exerted on a prey species population by a predator species that tracks the densities of its prey. Although the limit cycle approach is commonly applied to pest control situations, the long life cycles and generalist feeding habits of spiders limit their abilities to exhibit density-dependent tracking of their prey. Crops with short growing seasons and species-depauperate systems are the best candidates for limit cycle influences of spiders on prey. Spider populations that exhibit an uneven age-structure and have strong migratory/aggregational tendencies wou...

A monophyletic group of five species with spinose forelegs is proposed, including M. angusta, newly transferred from Arachosia, plus four new species: M. charrua, M. guenoana, M. fierro and M. carolina. One new species, M. tandil (from Buenos Aires Province), is proposed to be the sister group of Monapia vittata. A data matrix with 43 characters for the 13 species of the genus (plus 9 amaurobioidine outgroups) was cladistically analyzed. Although relationships among species are mostly resolved, the basal phylogeny of the genus remains unclear. The previous hypothesis of relationships of Monapia alupuran is unsupported in this new analysis. Additional records are given for M. lutea and M. dilaticollis.

They also sail across the water, taking advantage of the wind and their nearly frictionless interaction with the water surface. The physical interactions of Dolomedes triton (Walckenaer 1837) (Araneae, Pisauridae) with moving air, in a wind tunnel in which the floor was water, formed the core of the present investigation. Spiders in an elevated (sailing) posture were subjected to greater drag forces attributable to air motion than were spiders in a prone (non-sailing) posture and therefore were transported substantially faster than prone spiders. In the context of transport velocity, the benefit of adopting an elevated posture was substantially greater (relative to mass) for small spiders than for large ones, although even under the relatively steady flow conditions of the wind tunnel the velocities of the small spiders in the elevated posture were...

Males and females apparently matured at the same instar, males appeared shorter-lived than females, and individuals within the nests were clearly synchronized with each other in the stage of their life cycle.

We report data collected over a three-year period (1984-86) on reproduction, life history, phenology, microhabitat, prey, and dispersion for D. mojavea in the Coachella Valley, California. This is one of few studies to calculate life history table parameters for a desert arachnid.

These spiders appear to fit a Type III survivorship curve. Density of D. mojavea was typical for a desert spider at 0.02 &lt;tex-math&gt;$\text{spiders}/{\rm m}^{2}$&lt;/tex-math&gt;. Finally, our findings complement the only other study on D. mojavea (Nuessly &amp; Goeden 1984).

N2  - We investigated host specificity, the effects of host size, and the effects of the size, structure and occupancy of host webs on the abundance of the kleptobiotic spider Argyrodes antipodianus O.P.-Cambridge 1880. The kleptobiont is not host specific, but does prefer orb webs that are surrounded by a scaffold of threads (barrier-web). Across all hosts, host size had little effect on the abundance of the kleptobiont, while host density and the presence of other species of Argyrodes on webs had no effect. Web diameter, although not strongly related to the abundance of A. antipodianus in the field, limited kleptobiont numbers in greenhouse experiments. On webs of the Golden Orb Spider, Nephila plumipes (Latreille 1804), numbers of A. antipodianus were not affected by size of the scaffold or by aggregation of host webs. However, presence of host males was associated with a significantly higher abundance of A. antipodianus, suggesting that these kleptoparasites may take advantage of distracted females and impo...

N2  - We compared the abundance of spiders and predaceous insects in five central California vineyards. Spiders constituted 98.1% of all predators collected. More than 90% of all spiders collected were from eight species of spiders, representing six families. Two theridiids (Theridion dilutum and T. melanurum) were the most abundant, followed by a miturgid (Cheiracanthium inclusum) and an agelinid (Hololena nedra). Predaceous insects comprised 1.6% of all predators collected, and were represented by six genera in five families. Nabis americoferis (Heteroptera, Nabidae) was the most common predaceous insect, with its densities highest late in the growing season. Chrysoperla carnea, Chrysoperla comanche and Chrysopa oculata (Neuroptera, Chrysopidae) and Hippodamia convergens (Coleoptera, Coccinellidae) were most abundant early in the season. The dominance of spiders may be due to their more stable position in the vineyard predator community compared to predaceous insects. We also suggest that the low percentage o...

N2  - The erigonine spider genus Sisicottus is revised for the first time. Cladistic analysis of Sisicottus suggests the following hypothesis of interspecific relationships: ((S. montigenus, S. quoylei) (S. panopeus (S. montanus (S. crossoclavis (S. cynthiae (S. orites (S. nesides, S. aenigmaticus))))))). The monophyly of the genus is unambiguously supported by six putative synapomorphies: a terminal embolic hook, a suprategular membrane projecting apically from the distal suprategular apophysis, copulatory ducts that originate on the ectal side of the spermathecae, imbricated stridulatory striae, the presence of two dorsal macrosetae on tibia III, and the absence of a trichobothrium on metatarsus IV. Evidence for the monophyly of each Sisicottus species is discussed. A taxonomic key, diagnoses, descriptions, quantitative character values, illustrations, locality records, natural history information, and distribution maps are presented for the nine recognized species. Five new species are described: S. quoylei,...

N2  - An overwhelming number of endemic species belonging to the spider genus Dysdera have been reported from the oceanic archipelago of the Canary Islands. A complete taxonomic revision is currently being performed in order to assess the extent of this species' radiation, as well as to supply enough data to place it in a phylogenetic framework. The present article is devoted to the Dysdera species inhabiting the island of Tenerife. A total of 22 species is recognized in Tenerife, including the cosmopolitan Dysdera crocota C.L. Koch 1839. Two new species are described: Dysdera guayota new species and Dysdera hernandezi new species. Ten new synonymies are reported: D. moquinalensis Wunderlich 1991 and D. vilaflorensis Wunderlich 1991 = D. brevispina Wunderlich 1991; D. medinae Wunderlich 1991 = D. cribellata Simon 1883; D. inaequuscapillata Wunderlich 1991 = D. crocota; D. pergrada Wunderlich 1991, D. pseudopergrada Wunderlich 1991, D. tabaibaensis Wunderlich 1991, D. teideensis Wunderlich 1991 and D. teneriffen...

N2  - We studied solar light cues that may be used by Lycosa tarentula (Linnaeus 1758) (Araneae, Lycosidae) for homing. Experiments performed under clear skies, under overcast skies, and under clear skies as seen through a plastic sheet (which changed the polarization from linear to elliptical), allowed us to discover which attributes of daylight were used by the spiders during orientation and homing. We found that patterns of linearly polarized light in the natural sky were sufficient to allow accurate homing by the spiders. The homing behavior of individuals having the anterior median eyes (AME) or all other eyes blinded allowed us to determine that AME were responsible for the reception of polarized light. Electroretinography of all eyes confirmed that only the anterior median eyes were differentially sensitive to the orientation of polarization in linearly polarized light.

N2  - An analysis of the spider assemblage structure and the presence of indicator species in the Flemish coastal dunes are presented. The analysis is based on data from more than 170 year-round pitfall sampling campaigns from the 1970s onwards. We were able to find indicator species for all identified habitats. The assemblages are determined by variation in vegetation structure (succession), atmospheric and soil humidity and the occurrence of both natural of anthropogenic disturbance. In the fragmented habitats (grasslands and grey dunes), a clear relationship was found between the mean habitat size and the stability of the assemblage composition. In moss dominated dunes and short grasslands total species numbers do not increase with patch size. Due to microhabitat variation and the possibility of attaining viable population sizes the total number of typical species is, however, higher in larger patches. In small patches, edge effects are more important and the number of observed species is enlarged by the int...
