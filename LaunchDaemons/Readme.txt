LaunchDaemons
-------------

The files in this folder where created using Lingon http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingon/files/,
which is now no longer supported by the developer (see 
http://theappleblog.com/2009/08/10/smultron-and-lingon-developer-hangs-up-hat/ ).

The files reside in /Library/LaunchDaemons, and do the following

info.bioguid.evoldir.plist		Retrive EvolDir emails and repost to Twitter
info.bioguid.ion.plist			Harvest ION RSS feed
info.bioguid.journals.plist		Harvest RSS feeds from some journals
info.bioguid.status.plist		Poll biodiversity sites to check their status
info.bioguid.ubio.plist			Harvest uBio taxon RSS feed
info.bioguid.zotero.plist		Harvest my Zotero account RSS feed
