N2  - Data about the bionomy of the Spanish pollen wasp species Ceramius hispanicus Dusmet are presented for the first time. Following the concept of Gess and Gess (1988) C. hispanicus can be characterized by the following ethological elements: a. Nest excavated in non-friable soil; b. Burrow surmounted by a turret from earth extracted from within the burrow; c. Nest possibly annual; d. Nest with relatively short main shaft, main shaft vertical to sub-vertical, with an expansion at the bottom of the shaft; e. Main shaft not terminated by a cell; f. Secondary shafts absent; g. Cells sub-horizontal, in a group to one side, all at different depths; h. A constructed mud-cell within an excavated-cell, formed from earth excavated within the burrow; i. Main forage plants are representatives of Cistaceae, Primulaceae, Lamiaceae, and Fabaceae. The entrance turret of the nest is unique in that it is reduced to three distally converging processes. During nest excavation the females perform pellet dropping flights and use a defined pellet-dropping area. Water is used to soften the soil. Females alight on the edge of a water source to collect water. Cell construction rate during this investigation was about 0.5 cells per day. Analysis of brood cell contents revealed Ceramius hispanicus to be polylectic. Cells were found to be provisioned with pollen originating from six different plant families. The most important pollen sources were Helianthemum (Cistaceae), Coris (Primulaceae), several species of Lamiaceae, and Lotus (Fabaceae). Pollen grains of the same plant taxa were found in crop and rectum of both male and female wasps. Males patrol and perch at water and to a lesser extent at flowers. Pairings were frequently observed at water. The daily period of activity lasted about 10 hours. Activity of males at water was high in the morning and declined during the day, while female activity increased towards the afternoon.

N2  - Nitela elegans Matthews, a new species from Australia, is described and illustrated. The first biological data for N. elegans and N. australiensis Shultz, both nesting in pithy stems, are presented. Both prey on Psocoptera, and appear to progressively provision their cells. Prey of N. elegans were nymphs of sp. B (Psocidae) and nymphs of Heterocaecilius sp. (Pseudocaeciliidae). Prey of N. australiensis were nymphs of Aaroniella rawlingsi Smithers (Philotarsidae). There appear to be at least two generations per year in Canberra, Australia. The pteromalid chalcid Eupelmophotismus pulcher (Girault) was reared from pupae of both species. A clutch of 14 Ceraphronidae (?Aphanogmus sp.), possibly a hyperparasite of E. pulcher, was found inside a cocoon of N. australiensis.

N2  - The Halictine bee Thrincohalictus prognathus (Perez) was studied in Israel in May and the beginning of June, 1998. Additional information was obtained from museum specimens. The species appears to be both common and widespread in northern Israel, particularly in the Galilee and Golan Heights where it occurs between altitudes of several hundred metres up to 1650m on Mount Hermon. Despite having an unusually elongate head, the species visits a wide range of flowers which generally do not possess a long corolla. Like most temperate halictines, only mated females overwinter and become active in the spring, as early as mid March. Males are found no earlier than mid May. The apparent age of females increases from March to May with newly eclosed, unworn individuals appearing in late May/early June. All worn early summer individuals were mated and had well developed ovaries. Thus, ovarian development and phenological data are inconsistent with the species being eusocial but are consistent with it being univoltine. The behaviour exhibited by paired females in artificial observation arenas indicates that T. prognathus possesses the repertoire of agonistic and cooperative behaviours usually found in halictines but that aggressive interactions predominate. Comparisons with other species indicate that the relative frequency of passing behaviour is very low and inconsistent with that expected for a communal species. I conclude that this species is probably solitary.

N2  - Sperm ultrastructure and aspects of spermiogenesis are described for the first time for a member of the hymenopteran superfamily Megalyroidea, the parasitic wasp, Megalyra fasciipennis Westwood. The Megalyroidea are a poorly-known, putatively ancient group of the Apocrita (wasp-waisted wasps), and they are the first member of the Evaniomorpha group of superfamilies (sensu Rasnitsyn 1988) whose sperm have been investigated in detail. Therefore their spermatology might provide clues as to the groundplan for the higher Hymenoptera.

N2  - Forty-three of the 82 Afrotropical ant genera (52%) have been revised to modern standards resulting in a 50% increase in number of species. There are currently 1705 species of ants known from the Afrotropical region, a figure that could increase to over 2136 species if all ant genera receive a modern revision. To incorporate all undescribed species, total Afrotropical ant species richness was calculated by extrapolating from data on the proportion of undescribed species collected at Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Cape of Good Hope section of the Cape Peninsula National Park in South Africa. On this basis there are an estimated 3105 species of ants in the Afrotropical region, with 45% undescribed or currently occupying an infraspecific taxonomic rank. This extrapolation assumes that the average range sizes of described and undescribed species are similar, which in reality is unlikely because widely distributed species are more likely to have been collected and described. I present a method that distinguishes between widespread and localised species to correct for this problem, which extrapolates 4093 Afrotropical ants species, with 58% of species estimated to be undescribed or currently recognised only at infraspecific rank. It would take a highly productive systematist at least 21 years to complete revisions of the unrevised ant genera. A strategy is presented for improving specimen collection and taxonomy of Afrotropical ants.

N2  - The ant Pheidole vaslitii Pergande has remained a taxonomic enigma since its description over a hundred years ago from a series of workers collected in the Sierra San Lazaro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. A reexamination of the apparent type series in the USNM collection reveals that some of the specimensincluding a major worker designated as lectotype by Creighton (1958)are not true types and are not conspecific with P. vaslitii. Selection of a new lectotype of P. vaslitii secures its identity as a form closely related to P. hyatti. It differs from typical P. hyatti by the presence of more extensive sculpture on the head of the major and minor workers and by its shorter body appendages, but intermediate phenotypes occur in parts of Baja California and California. Based on current evidence P. hyatti is reasonably interpreted as a single, polytypic species, with both P. vaslitii and an infraspecific nameP. hyatti solitanea Wheeler, described from Point Loma, Californiaas newly recognized junior synonyms.

In addition, we report that in insular Malaysia Adesha albolineata Cameron is a parasitoid of another hispine beetle, Promecotheca cumingi Baly, a pest of coconut palm. These are the first two host records for the braconine tribe Adeshini and strongly suggest that adeshines are specialist parasitoids of hispines.

N2  - The Encarsia strenua group is defined using three synapomorphies: presence of 13 specialized setae at the apex of the costal cell, a bare area above the stigmal vein and closely placed scutellar sensillae. Few morphological characters were found that could accurately distinguish some species of the strenua group because of variability within species and the lack of diagnostic differences among species. The morphometric relationships of females of five closely related species of the strenua group were explored using bivariate and multivariate statistical methods. Univariate or bivariate measures could not distinguish all groups, however, all five species were discriminated along the first two canonical variates. Host relationships, although having a strong effect on general size, do not affect the discrimination of taxa. An identification key is provided for six species of the strenua group. Encarsia citri, E. protransvena and E. strenua are redescribed. Two new species, E. bimaculata and E. neocala, are described. Encarsia sophia (Girault & Dodd) is proposed as a senior synonym of E. transvena (Timberlake).

In addition to the previously recognized Arhysosage flava Moure, A. cactorum Moure, A. ochracea (Friese), and A. bifasciata (Friese) (new combination), two new species are described: A. atrolunata Engel and A. zamicra Engel. Arhysosage germana Moure is newly synonymized with A. ochracea and A. melanothricha Moure is synonymized with A. cactorum, while A. bifasciata is resurrected from synonymy under A. ochracea with Camptopoeum opuntiarum JÃ¶rgensen as a junior subjective synonym (new synonymies). The genus is newly diagnosed and a key to the currently recognized species is presented. The name appearing in the literature as A. xanthina is a nomen nudum. The phylogenetic position of the genus among other calliopsine bees is briefly summarized as are relationships among the species. A cladistic analysis of Arhysosage produces a single tree with the following hierarchy: A. cactorum (A. flava, A. zamicra (A. ochracea (A. atrolunata, A. bifasciata))). Biological information on Arhysosage is summarized. The genus is presently known from Argentina, southern Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay and is apparently a specialist on Cactaceae (presently recorded from Echinocactus, Echinopsis, Gymnocalycium, Notocactus, Opuntia, and Trichocereus).

N2  - An aberrant new species of the Neotropical genus Hymenoepimecis, H. argyraphaga Gauld n. sp. is described from Costa Rica, and the genus is redefined to accommodate this new taxon. A key is provided to identify the Costa Rican species. It is hypothesised that H. argyraphaga occupies a basal position in the genus, and is the sister group to all other species. The systematic position of Hymenoepimecis within the Polysphincta genus-group is discussed and a sister-group relationship with Acrotaphus, another New World genus, is demonstrated. It is suggested that this clade has arisen from within a paraphyletic Polysphincta complex, a cosmopolitan group that has yet to be resolved as a series of monophyletic taxa. Host records for the clade are summarised, and it is shown that the group are specialist parasitoids of orb-web spiders of the families Araneidae and Tetragnathidae.

N2  - Larvae of the koinobiont ectoparasitoid Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga Gauld used a series of different adaptations as they matured to hold onto the abdomen of their host spider, Plesiometa argyra, its web, and the larval cocoon: the first instar did not leave the egg chorion, which was glued to the spider by the female wasp when she oviposited; the second instar used two pairs of ventral abdominal protuberances to help hold onto both the first larvas molted cuticle and to what was probably a sheet of coagulated spider hemolymph that adhered to the larva and to wounds that it made on the spiders abdomen; the early final instar grasped the shed second instar cuticle that remained attached to the coagulated hemolymph with the ventral surface of its abdomen; and the late final instar used a row of mobile dorsal protuberances with sharply curved spines that grasped lines of a unique web that the larva induced the spider to spin just before killing it, and then the larvas own cocoon silk. The pupa used a pair of toothed protuberances at the tip of the abdomen to stay at the upper end of its cocoon. Other aspects of the wasps biology that are described include infanticide by adult females; aculeate-like lack of use of the ovipositor to oviposit; manipulation of host web-spinning behavior, apparently by means of a fast-acting larval secretion with long-term effects; manipulation of host bleeding; alternative tactics in attacks on spiders; use of pheromones by females to attract males; cocoon spinning behavior; and a bias to parasitize female rather than male spiders.

N2  - Field observations in Sabah of a large braconine wasp, Shelfordia sp., investigating and ovipositor-probing at a frass hole in an exposed tree root suggested the possible location of a host. Investigation of the substrate revealed a paralysed and partly consumed larva of an anthribid beetle that had a 1st instar parasitic wasp larva on it. Both adult and larval wasps were sequenced, in separate laboratories, for the D2-D3 expansion region of the nuclear 28S rDNA gene. The sequences were identical and consideration of their unique features compared with many other sequences from ichneumonoids leads to confirmation that the hosts of Shelfordia spp. include Anthribidae living in tree roots. The implications of DNA sequencing for constructing quantitative food webs are discussed.

Furthermore odour glands were found in the fore, middle and hind legs of X. bimaculata and X. nigrocincta. Males of X. bimaculata and X. nigrocincta establish non-resource based territories to which they attract females by spreading secretions of the odour glands over their body. For this they brush with specialized hairs on their hind legs over the abdomen, which they extend in order to expose the pores of the odour glands. The function of glands in all three pairs of legs is discussed in comparison with similar findings of odour glands in other species of carpenter bees and leafcutter bees.

N2  - The foraging and mud-carrying capacity of the trap-nesting carpenter wasp, Monobia quadridens L., was examined in relation to load-lifting ability. The body mass of caterpillar prey collected increased over the course of the season. Consequently, the ability of the wasps to carry prey became compromised late in the season. Caterpillar mass was not correlated with wasp size, but the mass of mudballs used in nest construction was related to wasp size. Wasp foraging may be constrained by the size of pyralid caterpillars available at any particular time, which changes because of caterpillar growth. Mudballs are constructed by the wasps themselves; therefore, wasps may be able to optimize mudball size in accordance with their own size, but mudballs were much lighter than caterpillars and never approached the upper limit of the wasps ability to carry them.

N2  - The seed-harvester ant Messor julianus (Pergande) exhibits a parapatric distribution pattern with the ecologically equivalent congener M. pergandei (Mayr) in the Baja California peninsula of Mexico; M. pergandei replaces M. julianus in drier soil microhabitats within the contact zone between these two species. This paper describes the reproductive biology of M. julianus and M. pergandei to provide a first step in understanding factors involved in causing this replacement pattern. Mating flights of M. julianus were observed over a several week period from early February to early March, and thus appear similar to those of M. pergandei. Likewise, starting nests of both species contained one foundress. Moreover, the similar ecology and mating flights of M. julianus and M. pergandei suggest that the replacement pattern exhibited by these two species is associated with patterns of foundress survival. In regard to mating flights, both M. julianus and M. pergandei are postulated to have diverged from the putative ancestral condition of summer mating flights that occur in other Nearctic congeners. This seasonal difference in timing of the mating flight for these two species correlates with their being the only Nearctic species of Messor that are restricted to hot desert habitats. Alate females for both M. julianus and M. pergandei have poor tolerance to high temperature relative to desert ants in the genera Aphaenogaster and Pogonomyrmex.

N2  - The morphofunctional adaptations of the egg parasitoids of two arboreal mirids (Heteroptera: Miridae) for reaching the concealed eggs of their hosts, Calocoris quadripunctatus (Villers) and Calocoris trivialis (Costa), were studied in a natural ecosystem (oak forest) and in an agroecosystem (orange groves), respectively. Calocoris quadripunctatus is a predator of immature stages of Tortrix viridana (L.) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in deciduous oak forests, Quercus spp., in Tuscany. Eggs are laid in clusters and concealed among the scales of dead buds, where they are exploited by two parasitoid species. Chaetostricha walkeri (FÃ¶rster) (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) has a long ovipositor which is inserted between the scales to reach the host eggs, and is therefore an ovipositor prober. Instead, Telenomus sp. laricis Walker group (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) has a depressed metasoma which is introduced between the scales, and is therefore a metasomal prober. Calocoris trivialis is a phytophagous species that damages orange groves, Citrus sinensis (L.), and other Citrus spp. in Sicily. The eggs are concealed in the soft, decaying wood of old pruning wounds and are attacked by at least two parasitoids. Aprostocetus n. sp. near miridivorus (Domenichini) (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is probably both an ovipositor prober and an ovipositor driller, as it can also drill through the wood. Telenomus lopicida Silvestri (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) has a long ovipositor and a compressed metasoma, which is introduced into the host incision, and is therefore a metasomal prober. Such morphological adaptations appear to be linked to the host oviposition sites and explain some aspects of parasitoid exploitation efficiency; they may also help interpret other host-parasitoid associations that are unknown or questionable.

N2  - This work was carried out to monitor the number of xo sex alleles (CSDComplementary Sex Determination) in a limited population of Melipona scutellaris Latreille (Apinae, Meliponini) and to verify if introduction of inseminated queens from distant populations is a good and practical method to avoid extinction of small ones. Twenty-two colonies of Melipona scutellaris were brought from LenÃ§Ã³is, Bahia (12Â°342S; 41Â°232W) to UberlÃ¢ndia (18Â°52256"S; 48Â°12255"W), 500km south of the southern edge of its geographical distribution. Thirty foreign queens were introduced from 1992 to 1995, and the number of xo sex alleles oscillated from 7.0 to 36.0. The number of sex alleles was studied using a formula modified from the one of Laidlaw et al. (1956) n = 2M(N+1)/(H+1) (where n is the number of xo sex alleles in the population, N is the total number of colonies sampled of this population, H is the number of colonies that produced diploid males and M is the number of males that mated with the queen). These results showed that the introduction of inseminated queens serves to maintain the variability of sexual alleles and, consequently, allow the existence of small populations of Meliponini. These data are being taught to Melipona beekeepers to improve their bee yards and help in protecting the species from extinction.

N2  - Knowledge of the distribution and flower associations of the monospecific genus Priscomasaris is expanded. The nature of the provision, nesting situation, nest structure, and method of nest construction are recorded for the first time. Priscomasaris namibiensis Gess has been encountered solely in the Mopane Savanna/Northern Namib transition and Dwarf Shrub Savanna (of Giess 1971), all records falling within the northwestern extension of the Nama Karoo Biome (of Rutherford and Westfall 1986, as adapted by Lovegrove 1993). Flowers visited for nectar and pollen are of the families Aizoaceae (non-Mesembryanthema) and Molluginaceae. Nesting aggregations were located in sparsely vegetated areas of horizontally presented, stabilized, sandy soil. The nest is a multicellular burrow with its entrance surmounted by a mud-turret and with each excavated cell containing a constructed mud-cell. Water is used in excavation and construction. Evidence for bivoltinism is presented.

N2  - The bertha armyworm, Mamestra configurata Walker (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an important pest of canola (Brassica napus L. and B. rapa L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) in western Canada. It is the focus of research to develop a management program integrating microbial and insect parasitoid agents with cultural practices and judicious use of chemical insecticides. To develop IPM effectively it is essential to understand the impact of parasitism on feeding activity of the host. We studied the effect of parasitism by two solitary koinobiont larval endoparasitoids: Banchus flavescens Cresson (Ichneumonidae) is a native parasitoid of M. configurata; and the European Microplitis mediator (Haliday) (Braconidae) is a candidate for introduction to enhance the biological control effected by B. flavescens. Parasitism by B. flavescens resulted in significantly decreased food consumption and lower biomass production but did not reduce the time that the pest would occur in the crop. Host larvae parasitized by M. mediator showed a much greater reduction in food consumed, weight gained, frass produced and the hosts feeding time compared to nonparasitized larvae or those parasitized by B. flavescens. Management strategies should consider options that would minimize impact on parasitized larvae and introduction of M. mediator could benefit integrated management programs for M. configurata.

N2  - The entomofauna linked to native flora in and around citrus groves was studied in Italy and Jordan in order to find alternative hosts of eulophid parasitoids of the Citrus Leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae). Twenty new associations (12 in Italy, 8 in Jordan) among native and exotic CLM parasitoids and leafminers were found. Two new alternative hosts were recorded for Citrostichus phyllocnistoides (Narayanan) (an unidentified Nepticulidae on Pistacia lentiscus L. and Stigmella sp. on Rubus ulmifolius Schott, in Sicily and Jordan respectively) and 1 for Cirrospilus ingenuus Gahan (Agromyzidae on Salix sp., in Jordan). Five new alternative hosts were recorded for Semielacher petiolatus (Girault) (in Sicily Liriomyza sp. on Mercurialis annua L., Chromatomyia horticola (Goureau) on Sonchus spp., Cosmopterix pulchrimella Chambers on Parietaria diffusa M. et K., and Stigmella aurella (Fabr.) on Rubus ulmifolius Schott; in Jordan, Dialectica scalariella Zeller on Echium sp.). The other 12 new associations of CLM parasitoids with leafminers found in both countries include Neochrysocharis formosa (Westwood) (4 new hosts), Cirrospilus variegatus (Masi) (5 new hosts), Ratzeburgiola incompleta Bou
ek (1 new host), Ratzeburgiola cristata (Ratzeburg) (1 new host), and Asecodes delucchii (Bou
ek) (1 new host). Data reported here suggest that native vegetation harbours alternative hosts for both native and exotic parasitoids. They also underline that more attention should be paid to the understanding of ecology and biology of parasitoid species in order to use appropriate exotic enemies in biological control, preserving at the same time indigenous parasitoid communities.

N2  - Five species from three subgenera of Netelia were observed ovipositing on their hosts under laboratory conditions. Two species of the subgenus Bessobates oviposited without a separate insertion of the ovipositor beforehand. One species of the subgenus Netelia and two of the subgenus Paropheltes employed a venom causing weak (often incomplete) temporary paralysis, administered as a separate action prior to oviposition. The venoms had no long-term adverse effect on hosts and it appears that these taxa, and perhaps all other groups of ectoparasitic koinobiont Ichneumonidae, lack the host-regulating venom systems that have been regarded as instrumental in the evolution of endoparasitism in some koinobiont cyclostome Braconidae. In all species substantial parasitoid development was delayed until the final instar host had constructed its pupation site, wherein it was overwhelmed as a prepupa. Species of all three subgenera dumped eggs in the absence of hosts, and (if kept humid) such eggs subsequently split to reveal a living first instar larva (but not investigated in the subgenus Paropheltes). Species of all three subgenera indulged in non-destructive concurrent host-feeding, despite being supplied with honey solution ad libitum, making the necessary wounds on the hosts body with their mandibles. Occasionally non-destructive host-feeding occurred on hosts that were not also being parasitised.

N2  - We present the first survey of spermatodesmata (bundles of spermatozoa connected at the head by an extracellular gelatinous matrix) across the sawfly superfamilies. Spermatodesmata occur in all examined taxa within the sawfly grade (Xyelidae-Orussidae inclusive), but are not found in the Apocrita. Using DAPI staining, the numbers of individual sperm per spermatodesm were calculated and the values obtained are mapped on to the current phylogenetic hypothesis. The plesiomorphic spermatodesm in the Hymenoptera, based on that observed in the putatively basal family Xyelidae, contains relatively few sperm, approximately 16. However, in the Tenthredinoidea and in the Siricidae, far larger numbers are found, reaching up to 256 in the Cimbicidae.

N2  - Biological data for the hydrangeocoline braconid genus Aspilodemon Fischer are reported for the first time. An Aspilodemon sp. from Brazil is reported as a parasitoid of three species of Liodiplosis spp. (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) which induce galls on leaves of the liana, Mikania glomerata (Asteraceae); it does not attack other gall-forming cecidomyiids on the same plant, and evidence suggests that it is ectoparasitic although direct observations of parasitoid larvae have not been made. How this affects our understanding of the evolution of gall formation and aphid parasitism by braconids is discussed.

N2  - The biologies of eleven species of Hymenoptera associated with the multi-locular galls of the fly, Fergusonina sp. (Fergusoninidae) were investigated. More than 2000 wasps were reared from 1100 galls collected in Queensland and New South Wales, Australia over a two-year period from 1997 to 1999 from Melaleuca quinquenervia (Myrtaceae). Additional galls from each site were dissected for observation and description of the immature stages. A molecular technique, which involved sequencing the D2 expansion domain of the 28S rRNA gene, was used to match the identity of the immature wasps with their adult forms. Of the eleven species of Hymenoptera associated with the Fergusonina sp. galls, we were able to observe and describe the biology of nine of the species. Eurytoma sp., Coelocyba sp, Neanastatus sp., Cirrospilus sp., Bracon sp., Megastigmus sp. and Poecilocryptus nigromaculatus Cameron, commonly or exclusively, fed directly upon the Fergusonina larvae and or pupae with most species developing on a single host. However, Eurytoma sp., Bracon sp., and P. nigromaculatus usually fed on multiple hosts. These species have specialized biologies, which enable them to chew through plant tissues to access gall inhabitants. Chromeurytoma sp. and Euderus sp. appeared to be hyperparasitoids based on the available evidence. The biological control implications of this suite of Hymenoptera are discussed in terms of their regulatory effect on Fergusonina sp., a potential biological control agent of M. quinquenervia, an invasive weed in Florida, USA.

Handlirschia tricolor Gess, 1973, is synonymized with scoliaeformis and a lectotype is designated for Stizus scoliaeformis. The revision includes diagnoses, descriptions, illustrations of significant characters for each species, and a distribution map. The phylogenetic position of Handlirschia within the Bembicinae is discussed.

N2  - During two years (10/9210/93 and 10/9510/96) the nesting biology of Isodontia costipennis (Spinola) was studied using trap nests in four distinct areas in the Campus of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, M.G., Brazil. Females built linear series of one to six brood cells, weakly separated by wads of grass stems and filled with plant material (grass stems and fibers). Cells were provisioned mostly with nymphs of Tettigoniidae and Gryllidae. Wasps eggs were laid on the cephalothoracic junction of the prey. The number of prey per nest varied from 1 to 18. Sixty-one adult wasps emerged from the 41 occupied trap nests (69% females, 31% males) and the sequence of sexes in the cells was variable. Thorax widths of females were significantly larger than males (respectively 2.63 Â± 0.22 mm and 2.37 Â± 0.20 mm). An ichneumonid wasp (Messatoporus sp.) was the only natural enemy found.

N2  - In general, the spermatozoa of Plebeia (Plebeia) droryana Friese are very similar to those described for other Hymenoptera. However, their arrangement in spermatodesmata bundles in the seminal vesicle has not yet been found in Apidae, this being a characteristic observed, to date, only in Symphyta, the Hymenoptera considered most primitive. The spermatozoa are long and thin, made up of a head connected to the tail at the position of the centriolar adjunct. The head includes an acrosomal vesicle, a perforatorium and a electron dense nucleus. The flagellum consists in a typical axoneme, two mitochondrial derivatives and two accessory bodies. Unlike most other Hymenoptera, the centriolar adjunct is very long and located between the nuclear base and the anterior extremity of the smaller mitochondrial derivative. It has recently been demonstrated that the structure and ultrastructure of hymenopteran spermatozoa are sufficiently varied so as to furnish consistent character matrices that can contribute to phylogenetic studies (Spermiocladistics). Since no consensual phylogenetic hypothesis has yet been proposed for Apidae, the data presented here may be a contribution in this direction.

N2  - Four species of Megastigmus Dalman have been reported as phytophagous in seeds of the plant family Anacardiaceae: M. pistaciae Walker, M. rhusi (Hussey), M. thomseni (Hussey), and M. transvaalensis (Hussey). All are Old World in origin. In this paper we summarize known host and distribution data for each species, place Megastigmus rhusi as a junior subjective synonym of Megastigmus transvaalensis, diagnose and illustrate all species, and provide a key to aid in the identification of females and, to some extent, males. Known host-plant genera are: Pistacia L., Rhus L., Schinus L., Ozoroa Delile, and Lannea A. Richard. Megastigmus pistaciae and M. transvaalensis have been accidentally introduced into the New World. The former has long been established in California and is reported for the first time from Mexico; the latter is widely established, through host-shifting, in the states of Hawaii, California, Florida, and in Brazil and Argentina.

N2  - The reproductive biology of Gryon obesum Masner (Scelionidae) was investigated in the laboratory using eggs of Euschistus conspersus Uhler (Pentatomidae) as hosts. Females typically began ovipositing on the day of emergence and continued to oviposit for a mean of 40.7 days. Mean lifetime fecundity was 267 eggs/female. Mean daily fecundity was highest (<22 eggs/ female) on the first day. By days 10 and 17, a mean of <50% and <75% of the eggs had been deposited, respectively. Sex ratio of progeny was female biased during the first part of the ovipositional period and male biased during the latter part. The post-ovipositional period was relatively short (mean of 5.6 days). Mean female longevity was 47.3 days when males and hosts were present, compared to 61.7 days for females that were deprived of males and host eggs. Because G. obesum has a shorter generation time and a greater lifetime fecundity than E. conspersus, it has great potential in augmentative biological control of this pest in crops such as processing tomato in northern California.

Brues original material is missing but comparison with his description and figures allows for positive identification of the species. Since the type material for this genus and species are untraceable and presumably destroyed the new specimen is herein designated as a neotype for the purpose of stabilizing the nomenclature and identity of this, the only definitive fossil of the family Pelecinidae.

N2  - The family Mutillidae in America north of Mexico is represented by 19 genera, including three of the seven world subfamilies. Five of these genera are further represented at the subgeneric level, giving a total of 27 taxa represented at the generic or subgeneric level. Caenotilla Pitts and Manley, new genus, is described and illustrated with its type species choreocarina Pitts and Manley, new species. This genus is based on females only and can be distinguished from other New World genera by the presence of a carina that delimits the pronotum from the mesonotum, presence of two carinae in the scutellar region (one being the scutellar scale), the shape of the thorax, the presence of plumose pubescence and the presence of carinae that laterally define the pygidial area. Mutillidae has remained poorly studied taxonomically and biologically for several reasons, one being marked sexual dimorphism. Consequently, many genera are known from only one sex. Of the 27 New World genera and subgenera, 12 are known by only one sex. A further impediment to advancement of mutillid taxonomy is the lack of a key to the genera. Presented here is a key to the genera and subgenera of Mutillidae in America north of Mexico, and generic diagnoses are given.

This brings the total number of named Australian species to 22. An illustrated key to the females of described Australian Arpactophilus species is provided and a lectotype for A. steindachneri Kohl is designated. Biological information is presented for each of the new species plus A. reticulatus (Turner). Extended parental care and progressive provisioning are the hallmark of this genus, with known species displaying a range of habits from solitary (4 species) to possibly eusocial (a nest of A. termes contained 19 adults and 33 cells). Arpactophilus reticulatus appears to be the most generalized, and was found nesting in stem cavities of five plant species across a broad range of habitats. It was parasitized by a generalist eupelmid wasp, Calosota sp. Four species used empty galls of a gelechiid moth, Sphaleractis parasitica Meyrick, on geebung, Persoonia falcata (Proteaceae). Five other species nested in old beetle tunnels in slender twigs of various trees and shrubs. Psyllid nymphs were the usual prey, but A. transversus also preyed upon cicadellid nymphs. All species appear to have multiple generations per year where weather conditions permit.

N2  - Three species of Neostromboceros have been reared from ferns in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The biology, taxonomy, and distribution are presented for N. albicomus (Konow) on Lygodium spp. (Lygodiaceae), N. congener (Konow) on Christella arida (Thelypteridaceae), and N. luchti Malaise on Diplazium asperum (Athyriaceae). Neostromboceros albicomus is a potential biological control agent for the Old World climbing fern, Lygodium microphyllum (Cavanilles) R. Brown, an invasive plant in southeastern United States. In the field, N. albicomus occurs on both L. flexuosum and L. microphyllum but attempts to rear insects from one plant host on the other were not successful. DNA sequencing of N. albicomus from the two hosts showed a single base difference between the two groups, indicating that two biotypes of N. albicomus may exist. Stromboceros (Neostromboceros) metallica Rohwer 1912 is a new synonym of Neostromboceros albicomus (Konow 1901).

N2  - Four species of Trichogramma Westwood are distinguished with overlap using morphometric analyses of 496 specimens with 27 measurements of males, 26 of females. The cryptic species of the T. minutum complex, T. minutum Riley and T. platneri Nagarkatti, are distinguished morphologically for the first time using canonical variate analysis. Intermediacy between T. californicum Nagaraja and Nagarkatti and the T. minutum complex is examined, with reference to other sources of variation. Males of the four species could be identified using a linear discriminant function with 03.9% error when applied to specimens used in developing the function, with T. minutum and T. californicum identified with error rates of 10.312.8% using novel resampled data; females could be separated with error rates of 3.318.9% using only the calibration specimens, with T. minutum and T. californicum identified with an error rate of 27.229.4% using novel resampled data. An identification key to males of the four species is provided that uses a combination of morphological characters and the discriminant functions. Implications of these results for quality control of mass releases and the identification of Trichogramma are discussed.

N2  - Melittobia digitata Dahms is an ectoparasitoid of solitary bees and wasps that can develop into two wing morphs. Clutch size and nutrition of the immature have been suggested to induce the morph differentiation in this parasitoid, although supportive data on the effects of nutrition on the morph differentiation is lacking. Here we describe the larval development of the wing morphs and the feeding behavior of M. digitata to support the development of an in vitro rearing system and further studies on the role of nutrition on the morph differentiation of M. digitata. Morphs were produced by rearing the parasitoid at two larval densities (20 and 200 larvae/host), with short wing morphs (SWM) developing from the small clutch and long wing morphs (LWM) from the large one. Morphs had similar larval morphology in all four larval instars. However, development from egg to adult of the SWM was shorter than the LWM (10.1 d vs. 14.5 d). Fourth instars of the SWM developed more slowly than the LWM (85.6 h vs. 46.4 h), while the pupal stage of the LWM was twice as long as that of the SWM (241.8 h vs. 109.0 h). Larvae of M. digitata were found to feed on host hemolymph soon after eclosion (12 h), and require 0.79 Â¼l/hemolymph to complete their development. Larval mandibles were too short to penetrate or cause significant damage to the hosts cuticle, and they might be used only to anchor the larva to the host. Our description of the mouth apparatus of the parasitoid larva, coupled with the data obtained on the host utilization, supports the hypothesis that the early stages of development of this parasitoid obtain the hosts hemolymph through the pore canals of the cuticle of the host.

N2  - Hymenopteran parasitoids of leafminers in California are reviewed and an illustrated key to 44 genera (except Braconidae) is presented. Leafminer surveys conducted by Michael Gates (MWG) and John Heraty (JMH) between 1996 and 1999, sought to assess native parasitoid fauna in preparation for the anticipated arrival of the citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton, in California. These records are augmented with leafminer parasitoid rearing records of David Wagner (DLW) and Jim Whitfield (JBW) accumulated between 19791986. Comparison of California parasitoid fauna with CLM parasitoids from other regions would indicate which native species are likely to shift onto CLM as potential autochenous biocontrol agents. Members of the families Eulophidae, Encyrtidae, Pteromalidae, Chalcididae, Eurytomidae, Eupelmidae, Torymidae (Chalcidoidea), Bethylidae (Chrysidoidea), Braconidae, and Ichneumonidae (Ichneumonoidea) were recovered, with >80% of specimens reared belonging to Eulophidae.

N2  - The genus Bootania Dalla Torre is revised and the genus Macrodasyceras Kamijo is removed from synonymy with it and returned to generic rank (revised status). Species included in Bootania are: gigantea (Girault), leucospoides (Walker), maxima (Strand), neocaledonica (Milliron), pilicornis (Cameron), ruficeps (Cameron), solomonensis (Milliron), and titanus (Girault). Species removed from Bootania to the genus Macrodasyceras are hirsutum Kamijo and japonicus (Ashmead) (both revised combinations). In this paper, redescriptions are given for the 8 known species of Bootania, and 4 new species are described: orba Desjardins and Grissell, moorea Desjardins and Grissell, fascia Grissell and Desjardins, and xestos Grissell and Desjardins. A lectotype is designated for B. gigantea. The holotype of B. neocaledonica is reported missing. An illustrated key is given for all species. Seven of the 12 known species have been reared from seeds of Pandanus and 1 was collected on Pandanus. Although hosts are unknown for the other 4 species it is likely that they are associated with the same host plant. Species of Bootania are Australasian, ranging from Bhutan, Burma, and Sri Lanka in the northwest, eastward to Republic of China and southward through Borneo/Sarawak, the Solomons, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia, Fiji, Moorea, and northeastern Australia.

N2  - The subfamily Ticoplinae Nagy is one of the more basal taxa in Mutillidae. Cladistic analyses using 21 characters have demonstrated that recognition of two tribes is supported. Ticoplini Nagy includes Nanomutilla AndrÃ© (= Ticopla Nagy syn. nov.) and Areotilla Bischoff; Smicromyrmillini Argaman includes Smicromyrmilla SuÃ¡rez (and possibly Cameronilla Lelej and Krombein, Eosmicromyrmilla Lelej and Krombein, and Hindustanilla Lelej and Krombein, should these be considered valid). The subfamily and tribes are reviewed and characterized, a key to tribes and genera is provided, and both sexes of typical members of the three main genera are illustrated. Nanomutilla nadae Argaman 1988 is selected as the correct spelling for the species also spelled N. nada in its original description, and Areotilla ferruginea Mitchell and Brothers 1998 for the species also spelled Areotilla ferruginata in its original description.

N2  - The oviposition behavior of Microctonus hyperodae Loan and M. aethiopoides Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Euphorinae) was observed in laboratory tests involving two host species, Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) and Irenimus aequalis Broun (both Coleoptera: Curculionidae). The parasitoids exhibited similar behaviors to one another and towards the two hosts, but M. aethiopoides attempted to oviposit more frequently and oviposited less successfully. About 66% of oviposition attempts occurred near the hosts anus and 33% occurred near the mouth, of which 8% and 3%, respectively, were successful. On rare occasions, oviposition was attempted near a hosts eye, antenna, leg or thorax, but such attempts always failed. Successful oviposition was characterized by insertion of the parasitoid ovipositor followed by tapping of the host with one or both antennae and, in the case of L. bonariensis, about 60s of host hyperactivity. Parasitoids were unable to oviposit in motionless hosts, but the hosts did not appear to exploit this as a means of defence. Microctonus hyperodae searched segments of ryegrass more often than M. aethiopoides, but neither species appeared attracted to host frass.

N2  - A new species, Acrophotopsis mickeli Pitts, is described based on 102 males collected in Baja California Sur. This raises the number of species of Acrophotopsis to four. Acrophotopsis mickeli differs from other Acrophotopsis species by having the following combination of characters, anterior fourth of the mesopleuron punctate, thin parameres with apices slightly curved dorsally, the cuspidis more than eight times as long as wide, the distal third of the middle and hind femora darkened, and the metasoma not concolorous with head and mesosoma. A key is given for the species. Current distributional data and illustrations are given for A. bergi Casal, A. campylognatha Schuster, and A. eurygnatha Schuster.

N2  - We present the first linkage map for a stingless beeMelipona quadrifasciata Lepeletier. The linkage map was constructed on 60 haploid drones from a single queen using 127 RAPD (Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA) markers. Eighty-nine of these markers mapped on 22 linkage groups. The remaining 38 markers were unlinked. The 22 linkage groups spanned over 1,416 cM, with an average marker density of 21.3 Â± 6.9 cM (mean Â± SD). Our data demonstrated that the recombination frequency of M. quadrifasciata differs significantly from that of A. mellifera Linnaeus. Comparisons of the genetic and social structure of M. quadrifasciata and A. mellifera, however, show that, besides the level of sociality, there are some particular life history traits that could be causing the specific recombination frequencies observed. It is expected that this map will substantially accelerate molecular genetic analysis of M. quadrifasciata and help to explain the observed variation in recombination frequency within Hymenoptera.

N2  - Three new species of parasitoid wasps (Braconidae: Microgastrinae) from Costa Rica are described: Microplitis espinachi Walker, n. sp.; Microplitis figueresi Walker, n. sp. and Microplitis marini Whitfield, n. sp. Two parasitoids of Sphingidae are redescribed for comparison with the three new species: Microplitis ceratomiae Riley and Microplitis chacoensis (Cameron) (=Microplitis ayerzai Brethes, New Synonymy). The ichneumonid wasp Acrolyta stroudi Gauld, n. sp., and the chalcidid wasp Conura convergea Delvare, n. sp. are also described; both are hyperparasitoids of prepupae in newly spun cocoons of M. espinachi and M. figueresi. The mesochorine ichneumonid hyperparasitoid Mesoschorus angustistigmatus Dasch, a hyperparasitoid of M. espinachi and M. espinachi larvae while still inside the caterpillar, is redescribed. The seasonal biology and host specificity of the Microplitis and associated hyperparasitoids is discussed in the context of the extensive caterpillar and parasitoid inventory data for the Area de ConservaciÃ³n Guanacaste (ACG) in northwestern Costa Rica. M. espinachi is a dry forest parasitoid of Agrius cingulata, Sphinx merops and nine species of Manduca (all Sphingidae), all when in the most open and insolated habitats and on a variety of host plants; it does not search for other common species of Manduca or other Sphingidae in slightly shadier microhabitats a few meters away. The extremely similar M. figueresi parasitizes Erinnyis ello and Erinnyis crameri (Sphingidae) in slightly shadier older woody succession (only a few meters from the microhabitat occupied by M. espinachi), and conspicuously does not parasitize Erinnyis oenotris or the tens of other species of sphingid caterpillars in the same habitat. M. figueresi finds E. ello on seven different species of food plants, and E. crameri on two others (but does not parasitize E. crameri on an insolated third). Neither species of Microplitis extends from the ACG dry forest into the contiguous cloud forest or rain forest, even though their host caterpillars do. While E. ello is a common pest in commercial cassava plantations, M. figueresi does not appear to have followed this host into this highly insolated habitat. Both species are highly univoltine and pass the last two thirds of the rainy season and six-month dry season in an extremely tough silk cocoon in the litter. In the ACG, M. marini is a parasitoid of only Xylophanes tersa in very insolated low herbaceous vegetation in mid-elevation rainforest and lower elevation cloud forest, and does not parasitize at least 15 other species of Xylophanes in the adjacent forest understory.

N2  - Andrena vaga (Panzer) and Colletes cunicularius (L.), both vernal ground nesting bees, were studied in the years of 19961999 in a lowbush heath near Cologne, western Germany. Both species are solitarily but nest gregariously and sometimes form large aggregations with thousands of nests. They are reported to feed strictly oligolectic on the genus Salix. We observed the daily foraging rhythms of both species and compared their foraging strategies. Colletes cunicularius started provisioning trips earlier in the morning, made more trips per day than A. vaga, and finished nest provisioning later in the evening. Colletes cunicularius burrowed even in the dark after 08.00 p.m. Andrena vaga collected pollen and nectar on different days each. One pollen day included 1 to 5 pollen trips. There was no clear correlation between the number of pollen trips and the occurrence of a subsequent nectar day. We found also no correlation between the occurrence of nectar-provisioning trips and weather conditions. Pollen loads of both species were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with a cell counter and two different hand-counting systems. Andrena vaga collected nearly twice as much pollen as C. cunicularius during one foraging trip. Cells and pollen loads of C. cunicularius contained large portions of other pollen types, mostly Rosaceae such as Prunus, Sorbus and Pyrus or Acer, Quercus and Ilex. Thus, C. cunicularius is not oligolectic as described in the literature. The percentage of pollen types other than Salix increased at the end of the flowering period of Salix, which indicates a resource restriction at the end of the season. The reproductive success of C. cunicularius measured by nest provisionment exceeded that of A. vaga, because of longer activity per day and digging activity in the evening.

N2  - The parasitic wasp Melittobia digitata Dahms (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae) is a gregarious external parasitoid of various insects, primarily solitary wasps and bees. Males of M. digitata commonly engage in fierce, often fatal, fights with other males. The mandibles are the main weapons used, and injuries inflicted vary greatly in severity from loss of appendages to death. We investigated the effect of size differences between winning, losing, and non-fighting males and whether body size was related to being a fighter or non-fighter. The head width and tibia length of fighting and non-fighting males were measured. Winning males (21 of 29 pairs) were found to be larger than losing males, and fighting males (winners and losers combined) were found to be larger than non-fighting males (8 pairs). Mandible lengths of a subset of all males (15 fighters, 12 non-fighters) were subsequently measured; only fighters left mandible length was significantly correlated with head width. The possibility that two behavioral forms (fighters and non-fighters) exist is considered but will require further experiments to resolve.

N2  - A new species of polyembryonic encyrtid of the genus Copidosoma is described from north-central Kazakhstan. Copidosoma naurzumense, n. sp., was reared from tineid moth larvae collected from regurgitated pellets collected near eagle nests in the Naurzum nature reserve. This is the third species of the genus Copidosoma reported from Kazakhstan. This species is similar to C. longiventre Myartseva form Turkmenistan, from which it differs by having dark tegulae and front coxae, shorter antennal segments and clava, and smaller body size. The natural history and ecology of the parasitoid and its host are discussed.

N2  - The external and selected parts of the internal anatomy of the larva of Orussus abietinus (Orussidae) are examined. The external anatomy is similar to that reported for other Orussidae. The eyes, laterocervicalia, and thoracic legs are absent, and the antennae, maxillae, and labium are reduced. Each thoracic and abdominal segment has a pair of short transverse rows of recurved cuticular spines laterodorsally, probably for locomotory purposes. A previously unreported feature is the configuration of the hindgut, which has a set of transverse interlocking cuticular folds. The mid- and hindgut are anatomically continuous. Overall, the larval anatomy of Orussidae is highly reduced compared with that of other basal hymenopteran lineages and resembles that of apocritan larvae. The modifications of the larval anatomy are probably correlated with the shift in lifestyle from herbivorous to carnivorous, which is less demanding of the sensory, feeding, and locomotory apparatus.

N2  - We present the results of circle tube experiments performed upon a solitary panurgine bee Acamptopoeum submetallicum (Spinola) and the enigmatic Nolanomelissa toroi Rozen. As expected for a solitary species, females of A. submetallicum generally avoided one another. In contrast, N. toroi exhibited high levels of aggression, as generally found among bees with a reproductive division of labor. However, dissection and phenological data on N. toroi are incompatible with either eusocial or semisocial behaviors. Furthermore, no acts of cooperation were observed in the behavioral experiments suggesting that N. toroi is not communal. The extremely female biased sex ratio and low levels of mandibular wear among mated, reproductively active females in this species remain difficult to explain.

N2  - A cladistic analysis of Agathirsia Westwood is performed and synapomorphies are proposed for the first time for members of Agathirsia, i.e., reduction of the ventral mandibular tooth, and apicomedial pegs of the hind tibia flattened, and for members of its sister-group Crassomicrodus Ashmead, i.e., apicomedial pegs of the hind tibia sharp and seta-like, and tarsal claws simple, without basal lobes. Members of Agathirsia are restricted to the arid regions of Mexico and the southwestern USA. Keys are provided to identify the genera of Agathidini and the species of Agathirsia. The mouthparts of Agathirsia are described and three main types of nectar extraction mechanisms are discussed, i.e., 1) sponge-like glossa that retracts within the galeae, 2) straw-like glossa that does not retract, and 3) labial palpi that form a drinking tube. The genus Agathirsia is revised to include 31 species, 23 of which are newly described, i.e., A. armandi, A. asterophila, A. bicolor, A. bifidilingua, A. campanisura, A. capillata, A. collini, A. davidi, A. foveiseries, A. heleni, A. kellyi, A. keni, A. jervisi, A. longigladia, A. longilingua, A. michelei, A. minuata, A. ninesevensi, A. papoui, A. parkeningi, A. reai, A. rostrata, and A. tiro. Agathirsia rufiventris Westwood is considered a junior synonym of A. proxima Westwood. The monotypic genus Cenostomus is synonomized with Agathrisia. Cenostomus trichiosomus (Cameron) is transferred to Agathirsia, and Crassomicrodus pumilus (Szepligeti) is transferred to Bassus Fabricius.

Larvae of the three species develop in stem galls of different, but congeneric asteraceous plant species that are endemic to tallgrass prairies of midwestern North America, A. rufus in Silphium laciniatum L., A. meganae in S. terebinthinaceum Jacquin, and A. jeanae in S. perfoliatum L. Adults of the three species are very similar morphologically, but differ in structure of the antennae, length of ovipositors, depth of galls in plant tissues, and mass of mature larvae. An allozyme study confirmed that wasps from the three plant species are reproductively isolated from one another.

N2  - Females of Lycorina apicalis Cresson and L. marvini Gauld (Ichneumonidae: Lycorininae) were dissected and found to have pedunculate eggs with an anchor at the tip, similar to those of Tryphoninae. Several differences are noted between Tryphoninae and Lycorininae and thus no close relationship is indicated. Observations of L. apicalis reared from a larva of Omiodes indicata (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) demonstrate that this species is a koinobiont that finishes its development as an ectoparasitoid. However, we were unable to locate the early larval stages of the parasitoid on the exterior of the host.

N2  - The neotropical bumble bee Bombus (Fervidobombus) atratus Franklin is widely distributed in South America ranging from tropical and subtropical lowlands to high altitudes in the Andes. Most of its biology is known from studies conducted in Brazilian lowland forests and almost nothing is known from other areas, especially at high altitudes. Here we provide data on the nest architecture, brood development, worker behavior, seasonal cycle and associated organisms from seven colonies of B. atratus observed above 2000 m of altitude in Colombia and Ecuador. Then, we compare them with those data from Brazil. All colonies found were located above the ground, in disturbed areas. Most of the nests either lacked a defined entrance or had a single entrance; a single nest had five entrances, one of them more active than the others. Nests had from 1 to 8 active queens and up to 80 workers indicating monogynous and polygynous cycles as reported from the lowlands. Nests initially lacked an involucrum covering the brood but eventually developed an irregular involucrum of wax mixed with cardboard and carcasses of B. atratus and their associated beetles (Antherophagus sp., Cryptophagidae). Bees also built pollen pockets attached to larval clusters for feeding larvae. The average developmental time from egg to adult (29.6 days) and the percentage of cells with two pollen pockets (63.6%) were significantly greater than those previously reported. The maximum pocket diameter was significantly smaller, about half of the size, than those diameters observed in lowland colonies. The ecological significance of such reduction in size is still unclear but could explain the higher frequency of cells with two pockets in our colony. Nests maintained an internal nest temperature about 12Â°C warmer than external environmental temperature. Several workers were observed constantly scraping and cutting litter on top of one of the nests. Previously this behavior had only been known in Bombus (Fervidobombus) transversalis (Oliver), a closely related Amazonian species. As in the lowlands, B. atratus colonies at high altitudes seem to be active year-round. The beetle Antherophagus sp. was found in two of the seven colonies observed. They are probably scavengers, but nothing is certainly known about their role within tropical Bombus colonies.El abejorro neotropical Bombus (Fervidobombus) atratus Franklin estÃ¡ ampliamente distribuido en Sur AmÃ©rica, encontrÃ¡ndose desde las tierras bajas tropicales y subtropicales hasta las grandes altitudes en los Andes. Gran parte de su biologÃ­a es conocida de estudios realizados en las tierras bajas brasileras y casi nada se conoce de otras Ã¡reas, especialmente a grandes alturas. AquÃ­ proporcionamos datos sobre la arquitectura de los nidos, ciclo de desarrollo, comportamiento de las obreras, ciclo estacional y organismos asociados de siete colonias observadas a mÃ¡s de 2000 m de altura en Colombia y Ecuador. Luego, nuestros datos son comparados con los datos de Brasil. Todas las colonias encontradas estaban sobre el suelo, en Ã¡reas perturbadas. La mayorÃ­a de los nidos carecÃ­an de una entrada definida o presentaban una sola entrada; un solo nido tenÃ­a 5 entradas, una de las cuales era mÃ¡s activa que las otras. Los nidos tenÃ­an de una a ocho reinasactivas y hasta 80 obreras indicando estados monoginicos y poliginicos como ha sido registrado en las tierras bajas. Los nidos carecÃ­an de un involucro de cera cubriendo la crÃ­a, pero eventualmente desarrollaron un involucro irregular mezclado con cartÃ³n y cadÃ¡veres de abejas y los escarabajos asociados (Antherophagus sp., Cryptophagidae). Las abejas construyeron bolsillos de polen pegados a los grupos de larvas para suministrar el alimento. A diferencia de los registros anteriores, el promedio del tiempo total de desarrollo desde huevo a adulto (29.6 dÃ­as) y el porcentaje de celdas con dos bolsillos de polen (63.6%) fueron significativamente mÃ¡s grandes. Sin embargo, el diÃ¡metro mÃ¡ximo del bolsillo de polen fue significativamente mÃ¡s pequeÃ±o, cerca de la mitad del tamaÃ±o, que los diÃ¡metros registrados en colonias de tierras bajas. El significado ecolÃ³gico de esta reducciÃ³n en tamaÃ±o es desconocido, aunque podrÃ­a explicar la alta frecuencia de celdas con dos bolsillos en nuestra colonia. Los nidos mantuvieron una temperatura interna aproximadamente de 12Â°C mayor que la temperatura ambiental externa. Varias obreras fueron observadas constantemente raspando y cortando hojarasca en el techo de uno de los nidos; este comportamiento habia sido previamente conocido en Bombus (Fervidobombus) transversalis (Oliver), una especie amazÃ³nica cercanamente relacionada. Como en las tierras bajas, colonias de B. atratus en las grandes alturas son aparentemente activas durante todo el aÃ±o. El escarabajo Antherophagus sp. se encontrÃ³ en dos de las siete colonias observadas. Probablemente es un reciclador de materia en descomposiciÃ³n, pero nada es conocido con certeza sobre su papel dentro de colonias tropicales de Bombus.

The new species is mainly characterized by its unusual coloration: in the female, the scape, apical margin of frontal platform, clypeus, tibiae, and tarsi are orange. In the male, the apical margin of frontal platform, pronotal tubercles, and tegulae are white, whereas most of the antennae and legs are bright orange. Additionally, metasomal terga IIII are coarsely, densely punctate (only laterally so in the female).

N2  - The twelve genera of the tribe Oligositini (Trichogrammatidae: Oligositinae) are reviewed. The genus Brachistagrapha De Santis is removed from the tribe and synonymized with Chaetogramma Doutt, a member of the Trichogrammatini (new synonymy). Phylogenetic analysis supports the recognition of two subtribes, the Oligositina and Eteroligositina. The large cosmopolitan genus Oligosita Walker is found to be polyphyletic and its current species are assignable to both subtribes. Those transferred to the Eteroligositina are now placed in the resurrected genus Pseudoligosita Girault, long considered a synonym of Oligosita. However, the removal of these species does not render Oligosita monophyletic. Remaining problems in the classification of the Oligositini are discussed. Included are a brief synopsis of each genus and a key to genera.

N2  - Coccygidium gregarium Sarmiento & Sharkey, the first known gregarious species of the subfamily Agathidinae (Braconidae), is described. This species was reared from a larva of Euglyphis sp. (Lasiocampidae). The SEM images of its last antennal flagellomere reveal that the characteristic acuminate shape is due to the presence of elongated, presumably sensory, structures. This type of flagellomere, together with its carinate hind trochantellus, are traits present in the genera Coccygidium, Biroia, Dichelosus, Hemichoma and in the Afrotropical genus Hyrtanommatium, suggesting a close phylogenetic relationship. The apex of the ovipositor sheath bears a small pointed process present in other Coccygidium species and also in Biroia, Dichelosus, and Hemichoma but not in Hyrtanommatium; this trait may suggest a close relationship among these genera. SEM images of this structure show that it is covered by ampulliform papillae, here reported for the first time. The pores on the inner apex of the ovipositor sheaths and the ampulliform papillae are either secretory or sensory.

N2  - Host searching behaviour, oviposition and the ovarian egg of the koinobiont ichneumonid Lycorina triangulifera are described. Oviposition attacks were observed on two species of leaf spinning tortricid larvae, the ovipositor being inserted into the hosts anus. The ovarian egg does not have the sinuous and leech-like characteristics described and figured by Iwata (1958). Rather, its elongate oval shape is unremarkable, but it carries a small anchoring device at its (presumed) caudal end. This strongly suggests that the egg is laid externally with respect to the host cuticle. One adult was reared from the experimental tortricid host Acleris schalleriana, but observations were not close enough to ascertain whether the development of the larva was endoparasitic or ectoparasitic. Nevertheless, it seems probable that Lycorina is essentially a koinobiont ectoparasitoid with an unusual egg placement.

N2  - As in many other hymenopterans, sex in Habrobracon hebetor (Say) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) is determined by single-locus complementary sex determination. Thus, unfertilized eggs become haploid males and fertilized eggs that are homozygous and heterozygous at the sex locus develop into diploid males and females, respectively. We investigated the effect of temperature during development on the production and survivorship of diploid males. Females were allowed to oviposit at 20Â°C and 27Â°C and progeny remained at the same temperature throughout development. Diploid males were produced at both temperature regimes indicating that temperature does not affect sex determination in H. hebetor. However, temperature did affect diploid male survivorship, which was higher at the low temperature.

N2  - Megischus basalis sp. n. is described from male specimens collected in Guatemala and misidentified in the literature as M. annulator BrullÃ©. The new taxon is incompatible with all genus-level schemes proposed in the literature and is tentatively interpreted as the most basal species of the Megischus-complex, immediately apical to Stephanus s. s., representing an entirely new step to be considered in the phylogeny of the family. The new taxon illustrates the difficult interpretation of aberrant stephanid species, suggesting that such taxa should not be assigned to new genera without a formal cladistic analysis.

N2  - Aggregations of diapausing Polistes versicolor were observed and sampled at three sites in the Venezuelan Northern Cordillera (ca 2,400 m) during the dry season (November to April). During the wet season (MayOctober), Polistes versicolor occupies lowland areas where food supply appears to be abundant year round. Here it coexists with P. canadensis which does not move to the mountains during the dry season so there seems to be no basis for a seasonal diapause in P. versicolor. The phenomenon is compared with a conspecific population in Brazil that also has been reported to aggregate. Energy savings, escape from predators, and the presence of a pronounced dry season at lower elevations are some of the possible reasons for this behavior.Resumen.Agregaciones de Polistes versicolor en diapausa fueron observadas y colectadas durante la Ã©poca seca (Noviembre a Abril), en tres lugares diferentes de la Cordillera de la Costa Venezolana (ca 2.400 m). Durante la Ã©poca hÃºmeda (MayoOctubre), P. versicolor ocupa Ã¡reas en Venezuela donde el suministro de alimentos es abundante todo el aÃ±o. AquÃ­ coexiste con P. canadensis, la cual no se mueve hasta las montaÃ±as durante la Ã©poca seca, de manera que no pareciera existir una base para que tenga una diapausa estacional. El fenÃ³meno es comparado con una poblaciÃ³n coespecÃ­fica estudiada en Brasil, la cual ha sido reportada en agregaciones. Ahorro energÃ©tico, escape de depredadores o que la presencia de la Ã©poca seca demanda la apariciÃ³n de una diapausa, se mencionan como algunas de las razones para exhibir este comportamiento.

N2  - Four species of Microdontomerus Crawford have been recognized in the New World: anthidii (Ashmead), anthonomi (Crawford), bicoloripes (Crawford), and fumipennis Crawford. In this paper the genus is revised and the following new species are described: apianus, braconivorus, buprestae, ciscada, darwini, eboreus, enigma, gordhi, hemileucae, mysticus, parkeri, rictus, secus, westcotti, and zoyphius, making a total of 19 described New World species. Keys and illustrations are given to distinguish all species, and host and distribution data are summarized. The new species include parasitoids of range caterpillar eggs (possibly as hyperparasitoids); geometrid larvae; tachinid and braconid parasitoids of Lepidoptera; several burprestid crown borers; a cerambycid stem borer; root and stem weevils; and several solitary bees.

N2  - The giant resin bee, Megachile sculpturalis Smith (Megachilidae: Megachilinae), is a species originally of Asia recently adventive in North America. This large and conspicuous species was first recorded at a few localities in the mid-Atlantic states of the United States, but is now found from southeastern Canada (Ontario) to Georgia, and as far west as western Pennsylvania and northwestern Alabama. Known occurrences of this species in its native distributional areas were used to generate an ecological niche model for the species, which can be used to anticipate the geographic potential for species in novel landscapes. The niche model was tested on the native range of the species for robustness in predicting independent suites of occurrence points. The niche model was then used to predict the potential distribution of M. sculpturalis in North Americaour results indicate that this species has the potential eventually to occupy the entire eastern half of the continent, as far west as the Great Plains. The model also predicts that the species would find appropriate conditions along the Pacific Coast, in Mexico, and in the West Indies. Impacts of M. sculpturalis on native Megachile species are entirely unknown.

N2  - The philanthine genus Pseudoscolia Radoszkowski differs from other apoid wasps in having a narrow, pointed glossa similar in details to that of many short-tongued bees. Its other characters, however, even those of other mouthparts, resemble those of other philanthine wasps. Therefore the glossal shape of Pseudoscolia is presumably not homologous to that of bees, but was independently derived from the truncate or bilobed wasp glossal shape. Such a shape in colletid bees is not homologous to that of wasps, but is believed to be based on a different part of the glossa. The pointed glossa of Pseudoscolia suggests that it is reasonable to speculate that the ancestral bee had a pointed glossa.

N2  - Geodiscelis longiceps Packer, new species, is described from northern Chile. Morphologically, it is somewhat intermediate between Chilimelissa and Geodiscelis, but is clearly more closely related to the latter as indicated by numerous synapomorphies such as the broad basal bands of appressed tomentum, long and thin hind tibial spurs, well developed mesotarsal setae in the female, large and well sclerotised proctiger, angulate mesal margin and elongate inner membranous process to the gonocoxites and absence of a ventroapical process to the gonobase. It differs from the type species of the genus in the enormously elongate head and mouthparts but otherwise normal glossa. Based upon character states shared by the new species and the type species of the genus, a revised diagnosis for Geodiscelis is provided. Some comments on the adaptive significance of extremely elongate heads in the Xeromelissinae are made.

N2  - An apparently undescribed species of the braconid wasp genus Bathyaulax SzÃ©pligeti from Kibale National Park, Uganda, is recorded as a parasitoid of the callichromine cerambycid beetle, Chromalizus fragrans (Dalman) subspecies cranchi (White), a borer of forest mahogony tree, Trichilia dregeana Sond. (Meliaceae). The association was confirmed using DNA sequencing of a parasitoid pupa recovered from the pupal chamber of the beetle. A gabuniine cryptine ichneumonid wasp, Gabunia aff. togoensis Krieger, was also confirmed as a parasitoid of the same beetle. These rearings are discussed in the light of previous host records.

N2  - Social wasps of the polistine genus Polistes in the eastern part of the Lesser Sunda Islands (Sumba, Flores and Timor Islands) were examined based on the specimens recently collected by ourselves. The following four species are recognized: P. (Gyrostoma) diabolicus, P. (G.) tenebricosus, P. (Polistella) callimorpha and P. (Polistella) sagittarius. We include new records of Polistes wasps from Sumba Island. Nests and mature larvae of P. diabolicus and P. callimorpha, and males of P. diabolicus are described for the first time. New synonymies included are: Polistes sulcatus Smith, 1852, P. hoplitus de Saussure, 1853, P. tenebricosus leopoldi Bequaert, 1934, P. tenebricosus nigrosericans Bequaert, 1940, and P. tenebricosus sibuyanensis Bequaert, 1940, all under P. tenebricosus Lepeletier, 1836; and P. sagittarius indonesicus Bequaert, 1940, under P. sagittarius de Saussure, 1853.

N2  - The Cryptini Fenixia n. gen., from the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, and Dineotropica n. gen., from the Amazon basin, are proposed, described, and cladistically compared with literature data for representative species of all genera of the subtribe Gabuniina and 38 outgroup species. A total of 72 species and 51 characters are evaluated. Implied weighting results suggest that Fenixia is closely related to Lagarosoma Gupta, while Dineotropica is closest to Cestrus Townes. Unweighted analyses were inconclusive, but implied weighting results support the monophyly of Gabuniina essentially as defined in the literature, and suggest that Wuda singularis, and perhaps a few other taxa of Ceratocryptina, might be part of, or a sister taxon of that subtribe. The species Fenixia curta n. sp. and Dineotropica lissa n. sp. are described and illustrated. A key to genera of neotropical Gabuniina is presented.

N2  - The Pheidole californica complex comprises three closely related and partly sympatric species of seed harvesting ants restricted to the western Nearctic region. An analysis of morphological variation in the minor workers and major workers (soldiers) reveals that these species are more variable than previously thought. Nevertheless, morphological characteristics were uncovered that are consistently diagnostic for each species. Pheidole clementensis Gregg may be distinguished from both Pheidole californica Mayr and Pheidole creightoni Gregg by the diagonal rather than longitudinal rugulae between the clypeus and the eye in lateral view. The closely related P. californica and P. creightoni are most readily distinguished from one another by the angle of their lateral cephalic setae. Pheidole californica has decumbent setae forming an angle of forty five degrees or less with the lateral margins of the head in full face view, while the cephalic setae of P. creightoni emerge at an angle of approximately ninety degrees. Pheidole californica is broadly distributed in the western Nearctic region. Pheidole creightoni and P. clementensis are more limited in their range, the former being found in foothill or plateau habitats in northern California, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada, while the latter is limited to foothill and coastal habitats of southern California and northern Baja California.

N2  - The Neotropical parasitic wasp genus Cyclaulacidea Quicke & Delobel (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) contains two previously described species from Peru and Brazil that are known to feed on Bruchidae and Curculionidae associated with palms. An examination of Neotropical braconines from 19 insect collections reveals that species of Cyclaulacidea are much more widespread. Nine new species of Cyclaulacidea are described, and an identification key to the eleven known species is provided. The new species are: C. pottsae from Mexico; C. adairae, C. hunteri, and C. snyderorum from Costa Rica; C. fergusoni from Panama; C. picki, C. rominus, and C. sharkeyi from Suriname; and C. riceorum from Peru and Brazil. The range of C. bruchivorus Quicke is expanded from Peru to include Brazil, Bolivia, and Suriname, and that of C. matilei Villemant and Simbolotti is expanded from Brazil to Colombia.

N2  - Females of more than one species of the braconine wasp genus Zaglyptogastra were observed, on multiple occasions, probing with their highly mobile ovipositors into dead wood through the exit holes made by various beetles (Scolytidae and others) which were themselves far too small to be hosts of the wasp. Given that the structure of the ovipositor in this genus precludes drilling, it is proposed that the intersections of burrows of smaller beetles with those of the actual host provides one possible route by which hosts can be located. Our failure to find any parasitized hosts in the substrate the wasps were probing suggests that their mode of host location is not very reliable.

N2  - Trigastrotheca laikipiensis Quicke sp. nov., from Kenya, is described and illustrated. It is shown to be an ant brood parasite in claustral colonies of three acacia ant species which inhabit Acacia drepanolobium thorns. The larvae of T. laikipiensis sp. nov. consume ant eggs, larvae and pupae. Brood parasitism was found in up to 20% of Crematogaster mimosae and C. nigriceps-occupied thorns, but was far rarer in the case of Tetraponera penzigi. Crematogaster foundress queens actively defend T. laikipiensis sp. nov. larvae, cocoons and recently eclosed adults.Two new combinations and one new name are proposed: T. inermis (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville) comb. nov. (on authority of C. van Achterberg) [Spinaria inermis GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville, 1848], T. romani nom. nov.

Current concepts of S. cameroni and S. simplex Perkins, 1910, as interpreted by Bou

N2  - A total of 19 species of bees and aculeate wasps is currently known from the Cook Islands with six of them recorded for the first time: Pison spec. 2, Sceliphron laetum (F. Smith, 1856), Ceratina (Neoceratina) dentipes Friese, 1914, Megachile (Eutricharaea) spec. 1, M. (E.) spec. 2. The following three species are presumably indigenous: Anterhynchium (Epiodynerus) rufipes (Fabricius, 1775), Parodynerus bicinctus (Fabricius, 1781), Tachysphex f. fanuiensisCheesman, 1928. Three more species are possibly indigenous but their status remains uncertain due to taxonomic problems: Pison spec. 1, Pison spec. 2, Megachile (Eutricharaea) spec. 1. A comparative analysis of faunistic data from other Pacific islands showed that the indigenous aculeate fauna of the Cook Islands is extremely depauperate. In general the number of species, especially parasitic taxa, and endemics decline from west to east with the remote archipelagos of Polynesia possessing the most depauperate aculeate faunas consisting only of widespread species.

N2  - The 55 New World genera of Trichogrammatidae are reviewed and a key is provided for their identification. The family classification utilized recognizes two subfamilies and four tribes: Trichogrammatinae (Trichogrammatini) and Oligositinae (Paracentrobiini, Chaetostrichini, and Oligositini). Four new genera are proposed, Adelogramma, Pseuduscana, Thanatogramma, and Viggianiella. Five generic group names are given renewed status. These include Burksiella De Santis, Centrobiopsis Girault, Ceratogramma De Santis, and Zaga Girault, at the genus level, and Lutzimicron Costa Lima, at the subgenus level. Four genera are placed in synonymy: Uscanoidea Girault (= Gnorimogramma De Santis), Zaga (= Lathrogramma De Santis), Burksiella (= Parahispidophila Yousuf and Shafee), and Xenufens Girault (= Pseudoxenufens Yoshimoto). Fifteen new or revised species combinations result from generic synonymy and resurrection. Nine new species described include Adelogramma primum, Burksiella dianae, Ceratogramma jeffersi, Lathromeris hesperus, Lathromeroidea exemplum, Lathromeroidea gerriphaga, Pseuduscana sola, Thanatogramma oweni, and Viggianiella tropica.

N2  - The spider wasp, Pepsis grossa Fabricius is a common species of wasp found in the Chihuahuan Desert. This study was conducted in Big Bend Ranch State Park (Brewster Co., Texas) and reports on flowers of various plant species used by adults of this wasp as a source of nectar. Although nectar was obtained from the flowers from a total of 19 plant species, four of those species (milkweed: Ascepias texana and A. sperryi; Mexican Buckeye: Ungadia specisosa; Honey Mesquite: Prosopis glandulosa ) accounted for 73.6% of all plants utilized. The flowers from these plants were all characterized by short corolla tube lengths (<3.5 mm). At this site, P. grossa exhibited a narrow trophic niche breadth (Levin's index: B = 0.2816). Other common species of plants whose flowers were not visited by these wasps are also identified.

N2  - Five families and 13 species of Chalcidoidea (Hymenoptera) were obtained from mass-reared seedpods of Brassica napus L. (Brassicaceae) as putative parasitoids of the cabbage seedpod weevil, Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), in Georgia, USA. The species are Conura torvina (Cresson) (Chalcididae), Euderus glaucus Yoshimoto and Necremnus tidius (Walker) (Eulophidae), Brasema allynii (French) n. comb. (from Eupelmus Dalman) and Eupelmus cyaniceps Ashmead (Eupelmidae), Eurytoma tylodermatis Ashmead (Eurytomidae), and Lyrcus incertus (Ashmead), L. maculatus (Gahan), L. perdubius (Girault), Mesopolobus moryoides Gibson, Neocatolaccus tylodermae (Ashmead), Pteromalus cerealellae (Ashmead) and Pteromalus sp. (Pteromalidae). An illustrated key is provided to differentiate the taxa. Lyrcus maculatus constituted about 96% of all reared Pteromalidae and 86% of the total parasitoid fauna. The associations of B. allynii, E. glaucus, E. cyaniceps, E. tylodermatis, L. incertus, N. tylodermae, Pteromalus sp. and P. cerealellae with C. obstrictus are new, but some of these species likely are hyperparasitoids or emerged from insect contaminants of the mass-reared seedpods. The only previous report of a parasitoid of C. obstrictus in eastern North America, Trichomalus perfectus (Walker) (Pteromalidae), is a misidentification. The parasitoid fauna of C. obstrictus in Georgia is discussed relative to that known for western North America.

N2  - We present the results of a survey of the bee fauna of Black Rock Forest, Orange County, New York, USA. The survey focused on bees, with more limited data gathered for other incidentally collected groups such as apoid and vespid wasps. Surveys in 2003 with nets and bowls recorded 144 bee species (26 genera), 22 vespid species (9 genera) and 23 crabronid species (12 genera). Noteworthy records are detailed. A preliminary checklist of the bee fauna of the BRF is presented and discussed in relation to that of New York State, selected sites within the state, and of the northeastern USA as a whole. The cleptoparasitic species Sphecodes fattigi Mitchell, Sphecodes johnsonii Lovell, and Lasioglossum (Dialictus) michiganense (Mitchell), and the oligolectic species Osmia (Melanosmia) inermis (Zetterstedt) are newly recorded from New York State. Ecological patterns pertaining to sociality, nest type, pollen specialization, parasitism, and phenology, are summarized and discussed, as are the efficacies of different collecting methods. The net collected sample was richer than the bowl trapped sample in total bee species (117 vs. 113) and in the number of unique species (29, 20.4% vs. 25, 17.6%).

N2  - The biology and morphology of preimaginal stages of Entedon sylvestris SzelÃ©nyi (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), are described in detail for the first time. Entedon sylvestris is a larval endoparasitoid of the seed-feeding larvae of the weevil Ceutorhynchus sisymbrii Dieckmann on the small tumbleweed mustard, Sisymbrium loeselii L. (Brassicaceae). In the Ukraine, females of E. sylvestris begin ovipositing in late May and continue to lay eggs until the beginning of July. Females of E. sylvestris parasitize weevil larvae of various instars. The parasitoid larva remains within the body of the host weevil larva until the emergence of the latter from the dried host-plant pods. The morphology of each of the three larval instars is described in detail. The moult of the parasitoid larva into the final instar, as well as pupation, takes place underground. Adults of E. sylvestris must therefore penetrate a soil layer to emerge the following spring.

N2  - Alysiinae currently contains over 1,500 described species and is divided into the tribes Alysiini and Dacnusini. There is disagreement on how species should be grouped within Dacnusini, and Chaenusa Haliday is a prime example. Chaenusa sensu lato is defined by the presence of setae on the compound eyes (Griffiths 1964). Alternatively, Riegel (1950, 1982) treated Chaenusa s.l. as three genera, Chaenusa sensu stricto, Chorebidea Viereck, and Chorebidella Riegel, and differentiated the genera primarily using forewing venation and shape of the forewing stigma. Phylogenetic analyses using molecular data have not been undertaken. Therefore, we assessed the monophyly and interspecific relationships of Chaenusa s.l., Chaenusa s.s., Chorebidea, and Chorebidella through maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian analyses using mitochondrial NADH 1 dehydrogenase gene sequences. Chaenusa s.l. and Chorebidea were not monophyletic in any of the analyses, but four of five species of Chorebidea always formed a clade. Further, Chaenusa s.s. and Chorebidella were monophyletic in all analyses and were always sister taxa. The results of this study largely support Riegel's (1950, 1982) treatment of Chaenusa s.l. as Chaenusa s.s., Chorebidea, and Chorebidella. However, we suggest that Chaenusa s.l. be retained until additional phylogenetic analyses have been undertaken to confirm the relationships inferred in this study. In addition to the phylogenetic analyses, we discuss the morphological features relevant to Griffiths' definition of Chaenusa s.l. and Riegel's definition of Chaenusa s.s., Chorebidea, and Chorebidella.

N2  - The Diplolepis rosae gall community is analysed in Sicily (Italy), based on collections totalling 82 galls from 12 sites from which 1,026 adult insects were obtained. The gall wasp exits in March-June from galls induced the previous year. On average 5.6 D. rosae individuals per gall were obtained, corresponding to 44.8% of all the emerged insects. We obtained 4.3% of D. rosae males overall, the highest figure found till now for the cynipid overall in Europe, where male D. rosae are usually rarer, and the first record of them for the Mediterranean area. No inquilines were found, and, consequently, none of their specific parasitoids. However, Eurytoma rosae, generally considered as a specific parasitoid of the inquiline Periclistus brandtii, was obtained, together with the polyphagous Exeristes roborator. In all, seven parasitoid species emerged from the galls: four of them, Orthopelma mediator, Torymus bedeguaris, Exeristes roborator, and Eupelmus urozonus, start to emerge together with D. rosae, while Glyphomerus stigma, Pteromalus bedeguaris, and E. rosae, have their maximum peaks later in the year. All the cited species, except for E. roborator, showed a second peak of emergence in September, when D. rosae is absent. Parasitization ranged from 12.5 to 100%, reaching more than 70% in 66.6% of the samples, but it was rather low (30.5%) when males were present, even though there was no overall correlation between parasitization and D. rosae sex ratio. Statistical analysis showed however that all the parasitoid species (except for males of T. bedeguaris and P. bedeguaris) are longer (which we take to signify larger) than D. rosae males, and neither the size nor the sex ratio of parasitoids differed statistically depending on the presence of male D. rosae.

N2  - Detailed study of the skeletal anatomy of the mesosoma of Palaeomymar anomalum was undertaken, primarily with SEM. Four previously unrecognized putative autapomorphies for the Mymarommatidae were discovered: 1) absence of a functional anterior thoracic spiracle; 2) fusion of the propleural arm with the profurcal arm; 3) presence of a pair of rods on the anterior surface of the prophragma; and 4) absence of the metafurca. The presence of a concealed prepectus fused with the posterolateral margin of the pronotum was confirmed. Additional features of possible significance for evaluating the phylogenetic position of Mymarommatidae are described and discussed. A sister-group relationship with the Chalcidoidea is the most well supported hypothesis presently, but needs additional corroboration.

N2  - The opiine braconid genus Sternaulopius Fischer is recognized as valid, redefined, and one new species, Sternaulopius duplicatus, from Madagascar, is described. The type species, Sternaulopius bisternaulicus Fischer, is fully redescribed, with new host and distribution records. The only other previously included species, Sternaulopius beieri Fischer, is placed as a junior subjective synonym of Opius bajulus Haliday, new synonym. Opius bajulus is also redescribed and the genus group name Biophthora Foerster is resurrected for this species. Opius rossicus SzÃ©pligeti, is transferred to the genus Biophthora (new combination) and Opius castaneus Granger, type species of Frekius Fischer, is transferred to Utetes Foerster (new combination). Thus, Frekius is a junior subjective synonym of Utetes, new synonym, but is retained as a valid subgenus. Biophthora and Sternaulopius are compared to Xynobius Foerster (where Opius bajulus has frequently been placed), and Xynobius is redefined and treated as a subgenus of Eurytenes Foerster. Stigmatopoea Fischer is also recognized as a valid subgenus of Eurytenes. Characters used to define these genus-group taxa are discussed in detail, with emphasis on venation, placement of metasomal spiracles, and sculptural details of the body. Use of the term sternaulus for a longitudinal groove on the ventral mesopleuron in Ichneumonoidea is reviewed, and it is shown that the sternaulus in cryptine and mesochorine Ichneumonidae is not homologous to the precoxal sulcus in Braconidae based on dissections of associated thoracic musculature. A true sternaulus, defined internally as the ridge supporting the origin of the mesopleural-basalare muscle, is rarely present in Braconidae.

N2  - Melittobia is a genus of small, gregarious idiobiont parasitoids in the family Eulophidae. Following emergence as adults, females form circles in which they cooperate to chew an escape hole from the host cells in which they developed. Dry milked crude venom, which could contain constituents from the alkaline gland as well as the venom reservoir, has been shown to elicit chewing in M. digitata. Here we investigated whether a related species (M. femorata) chewed in response to compounds in its dissected venom reservoir plus alkaline-gland, and whether crude venom milked from a member of another species group (M. australica) would also elicit chewing in M. digitata. Melittobia femorata chewed significantly more at combined gland and reservoir extract-marked spots than at controls. To examine the crude venom's effect across species we marked spots with milked M. australica venom, and introduced female M. digitata wasps. These milked crude venom spots elicited chewing similar to that elicited by that of M. digitata marked spots, and the response to either's venom was significantly different from blank controls. Possible reasons for the lack of a high level of specificity in the chewing response to a pheromone are discussed.

N2  - For Anthidiini occurring in southern Africa, descriptive notes on nests of seven species belonging to three genera, have been published. All are constructed from plant fibres and, depending upon the species, are situated aerially on plants or in pre-existing cavities. To these are added first descriptions of nests of three further species representing three genera. Serapista rufipes (Friese), like the only other species of Serapista, S. denticulata (Smith), for which nesting is known, was found to construct nests from plant fibres, however, although similarly found aerially on plant stems, a nest with its builder was discovered in a burrow in the ground. Afranthidium (Nigranthidium) concolor (Friese) was found nesting in a burrow in the ground, like other species of Afranthidium, using plant fibres. Plesianthidium, represented by P. (Spinanthidiellum) volkmanni (Friese), was found constructing groups of separate resinous, spouted, pot-like cells, similar to those constructed by some extraterritorial species of Anthidiellum. Additional nest records are given for Afranthidium (Immanthidium) repetitum and Afranthidium (Afranthidium) ablusum. A first record (that of Alan Weaving) of a host, Megachile (Gronocerus) feline Gerstaecker, of Euaspis abdominalis (Fabricius) is reported. Anthidiini in southern Africa are relatively polyphagous. In the present analysis inter-generic and intra-generic similarities, differences, and preferences in flower families visited are indicated.

Classified in Mymarommatidae is one extinct Cretaceous genus, Archaeromma Yoshimoto, one extinct Tertiary genus, Palaeomymar Meunier, and three extant genera, Mymaromma Girault, Mymaromella Girault, and Zealaromma n. gen.Mymaromma and Mymaromellarev. stat. are resurrected from prior synonymy under Palaeomymar and a neotype male is designated for Palaeomymar succini Meunier. Protooctonus Yoshimoto is transferred from Mymaridae to Mymarommatidae and is newly synonymised under Archaeromma. Newly classified in Archaeromma are the Cretaceous species A. masneri (Yoshimoto) n. comb. (from Protooctonus), and A. mandibulatum (Kozlov and Rasnitsyn) n. comb., A. senonicum (Kozlov and Rasnitsyn) n. comb. and A. japonicum (Fursov, Shirota, Nomiya and Yamagishi) n. comb. (all from Palaeomymar). Classified in Mymaromma are M. anomalum (Blood and Kryger) rev. comb., M. buyckxi Mathot rev. comb., M. goethei Girault rev. comb., M. mirissimum (Girault) n. comb. and M. ypt (Triapitsyn and Berezovskiy) n. comb. (all from Palaeomymar). Classified in Mymaromella is the extinct Tertiary species, M. duerrenfeldi (SchlÃ¼ter and Kohring) n. comb., and the extant species M. chaoi (Lin) n. comb., M. cyclopterus (Fidalgo and De Santis) n. comb. and M. mira Girault rev. comb. (all from Palaeomymar). Classified in Zealaromma are the newly designated type species of the genus, Z. insulare (Valentine) n. comb. (from Palaeomymar) and Z. valentinei n. sp. Description of the structural diversity of extant and extinct mymarommatids is based on the 20 described species plus 15 undescribed extant morphospecies and several fossils from Tertiary Baltic amber and Burmese, Canadian and New Jersey Cretaceous amber. Evidence for monophyly of the genera is presented and the following phylogenetic relationships are hypothesized: Galloromma + (Archaeromma + (Zealaromma + (Mymaromella + (Palaeomymar + Mymaromma)))). Absence of mesotibial and metatibial spurs are newly proposed synapomorphies for Mymarommatoidea. New information is given on the structure of Serphitidae (Serphitoidea) based on study of several Taimyr and Canadian Cretaceous fossils, and structural features that are shared among Serphitoidea, Mymarommatoidea, Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea are discussed relative to establishing their relationships. Several features, including gastral laterotergites, a mesopectal region similar to a netrion, and a forewing venation that could be ancestral to that of Platygastroidea suggest Serphitoidea is closely related to Platygastroidea. No new evidence was found to support a Serphitoidea + Mymarommatoidea sister-group relationship. Independent parameres in the groundplan of the male genitalia of Mymarommatoidea and Serphitoidea is a likely symplesiomorphy that differentiates them from Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea. Two different types of specialized claval sensilla could support monophyly of Mymarommatoidea + Chalcidoidea, but further study throughout parasitic Hymenoptera is necessary to substantiate character-state distribution and homology.

N2  - The purpose of this paper is to introduce three new Neotropical species of cenocoeliine wasps that expand the morphological and biological boundaries of the subfamily. These three species share a complex of morphological characters that distinguish them from other known species of Capitonius, and because of this we propose these species form a distinctive and monophyletic species group. Unlike other members of the subfamily, the new species are dorsoventrally flattened and represent some of the smallest recorded cenocoeliines. The following species are described; Capitonius subcrusta Pitz and Sharkey n. sp. from Mexico, C. vegrandis Pitz and Sharkey n. sp. from Costa Rica, and C. tenuiflagellum Pitz and Sharkey n. sp. from Colombia.

N2  - The previously unknown male of Megachile nivalis Friese is described. Males of this species are very similar to those of M. relativa Cresson and because of geographic overlap of the two species, many male specimens presently identified as M. relativa within collections may actually be M. nivalis. An identification key and illustrations of mandibles are provided for females and males of the subgenus Megachile s. str. of North America. Images of genitalia, selected sterna, the lower genal area, clypeus, and forewings for males of both M. relativa and M. nivalis are also provided for comparison and to facilitate differentiation of the two species. A tabular summary is also provided for species of Megachile in North America that are known from only one sex to encourage the search for possible additional synonyms or hitherto unknown sexes.

N2  - Three chaparral plant species, Adenostoma fasciculatum Hook. and Arn. (Rosaceae), Ceanothus megacarpus Nutt. (Rhamnaceae) and Quercus berberidifolia Liebm. (Fagaceae), were sampled for micro-Hymenoptera in the Santa Rosa Plateau Nature Reserve in Southern California. Two sampling methods of the shrub's canopy are contrasted: screen-sweep netting and pyrethrum fogging. Using both sampling methods and across all of the plant hosts, 242 species of Hymenoptera were collected. A total of 558 individuals and 173 species were collected by fogging, and 287 individuals and 115 species by screen sweeping. Although fogging captured more individuals and species, results were significant only for the number of individuals collected on Quercus and number of species on Adenostoma. On the three different plants, fogging sampled a similar or greater number of species than did screen sweeping. In terms of estimating species richness, fogging had an equivalent or greater efficiency than sweeping for collecting individuals and species. When combined with the labor efficiency involved in processing field samples, fogging is superior to screen sweeping. However, given the sample sizes within this study, both techniques are necessary, with the fogging technique sampling only 71.5% of the total number of species of Hymenoptera.

N2  - In this publication, the first of a projected series revising the Afrotropical (essentially southern African) species of the genus Quartinia Ed. AndrÃ©, 1884 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae, Masarinae), eleven new species are described. Of these, seven occurring variously in the southern Namib Desert and in its southward extension down the western coast of South Africa, and one occurring on the southern coast of South Africa, have been found nesting in sand-filled snail shells. They are: australis, bonaespei, conchicola, namaqua, namaquensis, obibensis, and refugicola. To these species is added vexillata which is presumed to have the same nesting habits. A key to distinguish these species is given. The other three newly described species, all from Namibia, are: femorata, geigeriae and lamellata.

N2  - A west Texas population of Pseudomasaris phaceliae was found to be multivoltine and active from April to September. Unlike previous reports of nests constructed only on stones, nests were commonly constructed on the stems and infructescences of its host plant, Phacelia integrifolia. Emergence data indicated the primary sex ratio is strongly female biased (53&ratio;14). Nest parasitism was rare, but predation was common. Data on nest architecture, nest construction, and foraging behavior are presented.

N2  - We present data on the social biology of Halictus (Seladonia) tripartitus Cockerell based upon samples from California. This bee is at least partially eusocial and overwintered gynes and first brood workers differed in size by 5.14%. 35.5% of the first brood workers had developed ovaries, 11.2% had ovaries with the equivalent of at least one fully developed oocyte but less than 14% were mated. In July and August, female reproductive options seemed highly variable: approximately 55% were sterile workers, 2.6% had better developed ovaries than spring foundresses and over 20% had at least the equivalent of one fully developed oocyte whereas an additional 2030% may have been capable of overwintering as gynes. Ovarially developed workers were larger than those that remained sterile. Sixteen to 28% of the late summer workers were mated, but mated individuals were not more likely to have developed ovaries or to be larger than unmated bees. We discuss these findings in the light of the climate of the study area and compare this species with other members of its subgenus.

N2  - Field studies were conducted on encounters between the spider wasps Pepsis grossa (Fabricius) and P. thisbe Lucas, and females of their host spider, Aphonopelma steindachneri (Ausserer) (Theraphosidae), in Big Bend National Park, Texas. Females of P. grossa were significantly larger than those of P. thisbe. Number of eggs found in ovarioles of P. grossa and P. thisbe ranged from 614 and 312, with a mean of 11.3 and 8.4, respectively. Behavioral acts comprising hunting behavior of both species included antennation of a spider's burrow (BA), evicting spiders from their burrow (EVB), initial approach and antennation of spider (AA), moving away and grooming (MG1), attack and paralysis (AP), moving away/grooming (MG2), drinking behavior (DB), burial of spider and egg deposition (BO), and closure of the burrow entrance (BC). Antennae of most wasps made initial contact with the forelegs or palps of a spider. During AP, wasps typically grasped leg 3 or 4 of the host before inserting their stings. Most wasps of P. grossa (78%) inserted their sting into the intersegmental membrane between the sternum and coxa 2 of the spider; 88% of P. thisbe females chose a site between the sternum and coxa 1. Only 33 and 26% of P. grossa and P. thisbe, respectively, drank fluids from a spider's mouth or from sting insertion site (LB). Pepsis thisbe required significantly more time (mean: 129.1 min) to complete all behavioral acts of hunting than P. grossa (mean: 101.4 min). Wasps were successful in paralyzing spiders in all observed encounters, and no spider attempted to attack a wasp.

N2  - The koinobiont ectoparasitoid Zatypota petronae Gauld (Ichneumonidae) parasitizes medium-sized immatures of the cobweb spider Theridion evexum Keyserling (Theridiidae). Zatypota petronae apparently attacks the spider inside its retreat. An egg is glued on the antero-lateral dorsal section of the spider's abdomen. First-instar larvae remain partially inside the egg chorion which is attached to the spider's abdomen. In later instars, a layer of a brownish material (saddle), to which the 7th and 8th abdominal segments of the larva adhere ventrally, anchors the larva to the spider. In the last instar the saddle includes the egg chorion and the shed exoskeletons of previous instars. A row of retractile, dorsal protuberances, crowned with hooklets, is present on abdominal segments 1 to 8 of the final-instar larva. The larva uses the hooklets to grab silk lines of the retreat of the spider's web. Hanging on the spider's web the larva kills the spider and sucks out its body tissues. Then the larva pushes vigorously laterally with its head against the spider's corpse, and alternately presses the corpse against the saddle. These movements, in combination with peristaltic movements, free the larva from the saddle that falls to the ground with the dead spider. The larva then constructs its pupal cocoon. Prior to cocoon construction, the larva induces the spider to reinforce the retreat by adding more threads. Parasitism rate and host behavior are also described.

N2  - Thygater is a Neotropical genus of 30 species of solitary bees occurring from Mexico to Argentina. Information on the nesting biology is only available for a single species, T. analis, from southern Brazil. We studied the nest architecture, seasonality, and host plants of T. aethiops in two localities in the Eastern Andes of Colombia (< 27002900 m). Bees nested singly or forming aggregations in flat ground or sloping surfaces. Nests were deep (3959 cm) and consisted of an unlined but smooth long main tunnel meandering downward from the surface. Nests had three to seven nearly vertical cells, which were located singly at the ends of short vertical tunnels that descended from the main tunnel. The older brood was located closer to the nest entrance, indicating a progressive nest development. Monthly sampling and appraisal of museum specimens showed that, although females were more commonly collected than males, both sexes were present year-round. We present a list of 32 plant species (27 genera in 18 families), including exotic, native, and cultivated plants used by T. aethiops in Colombia. The most noticeable differences from T. analis are in the pattern of nest development and seasonality. Thygater aethiops builds nests in a progressive manner and it is likely to be multivoltine, whereas T. analis has a regressive nest development (i.e., older brood located far from the entrance) and a single generation per year. Long-term studies on different populations are required to determine if T. aethiops has continuous brood production or if larval diapause occurs at some point during the year.

N2  - The abundance, diversity, and morphospecies composition of the parasitic wasp fauna is compared at two levels in an Ohio (USA) temperate forest. The ground layer and the elevated layer (<10m) exhibited similar abundance but a distinctly different composition. The diversity at the ground layer was greater. Encyrtidae were captured more often in elevated traps while Pteromalidae, Ichneumonidae, and alysiine Braconidae were more prevalent at ground level. A retrospective analysis of the edge effect showed no difference in the composition relative to distance from forest edge but elevated samples had a higher diversity near the edge than in the interior.

N2  - The figitid genus Euceroptres Ashmead has recently been determined to render the Thrasorinae, a subfamily where the genus is currently classified, paraphyletic. To maintain the monophyly of Thrasorinae, Euceroptres is here redescribed and placed in its own subfamily, Euceroptrinae. All known species are redescribed and a new species is described; a lectotype is designated for E. primus Ashmead, 1896. The phylogenetics of Euceroptrinae, Parnipinae, Plectocynipinae and Thrasorinae are discussed, and the hypothesis that ancestral lineages of figitids attacked gall-inducing Hymenoptera is supported. Agastoparasitism among these lineages appears to be plesiomorphic. Though branch support is relatively low for inferring the precise branching order of the gall-inducer parasite lineages, the classification of problematic species is much improved.

N2  - Foraging strategies of two species of solitary digger wasps (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) were examined. Both species capture insects and return with them in flight to a burrow where they are used as food for larvae. The actual loading of the wasps was compared to a theoretical ideal, the maximum that they should be able to carry in flight. Bembix troglodytes Handlirsch is a relatively large wasp that carries many small flies to its burrows. The flies are much smaller than the ideal size, but the choice of small prey appears to be adaptive in that it should reduce the rate of stealing of flies by conspecific females, which was a common event. Tachytes chrysopyga Cresson is a relatively small wasp that carries relatively large prey, grasshoppers and crickets, to its burrow. The average size of prey appears to be ideal; however, the distribution of prey size is so great that many wasps were underloaded, while others were overloaded. Prey theft was not observed in T. chrysopyga, and flexible flight behaviors (e.g. short, hopping flights) allow it to carry a broad range of prey sizes. These two wasp species may represent near extremes of a continuum of behavior among predaceous wasps.

N2  - The recent increase in leaf litter ants sampling effort in Neotropical wet forests has revealed new and interesting records of the highly specialized myrmicine ant genus Stegomyrmex Emery, previously considered as extremely rare. We present a modified diagnosis for the genus and describe Stegomyrmex bensoni n. sp. and S. olindae n. sp., based on, respectively, workers, males, and gyne (central-north Brazil) and on a single worker (northern Brazil). Stegomyrmex vizottoi Diniz (southeastern Brazil) is redescribed and compared with S. olindae n. sp.; these species present significant differences in size, sculpturation, and sting apparatus morphology. The males of S. vizottoi are described for the first time. A key for workers and queens and a distribution map for the five know Stegomyrmex species are provided.

N2  - In this publication, the second of a projected series revising the Afrotropical (essentially southern African) species of the genus Quartinia Ed. AndrÃ©, 1884 (Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Masarinae), a new species with complete venation, strucki, is described. By virtue of the similarly deeply excised antennal club of the male, hitherto a character unique to Q. antennata Schulthess, a deceptive but superficial similarity to that species is shown. The differences between the two species are discussed.

T1  - Patterns of Usage of Snail Shells for Nesting by Wasps (Vespidae: Masarinae and Eumeninae) and Bees (Megachilidae: Megachilinae) in Southern Africa

N2  - The present contribution to the knowledge of the use of snail shells for nesting by Hymenoptera in southern Africa adds considerably to the earlier contribution by the authors on this subject. It establishes that the strategy of nesting in sand-filled shells is commonly employed by Quartinia Ed. AndrÃ© (Vespidae: Masarinae) throughout the sandy winter rainfall areas. It records additional rearings from Quartinia nests of Allocoelia MocsÃ¡ry (Chrysididae), Tricholabiodes Radoszkowski and an undescribed genus (Mutillidae), and Apolysis hesseana Evenhuis and Greathead (Bombyliidae). Nesting by Tachysphex hermia Arnold (Crabronidae: Larrinae) in a sand-filled snail shell is recorded for the first time. It establishes that the distribution of use of snail shells for nesting by bees coincides with and extends along the south coast east of that of Quartinia. The bees (Megachilidae: Megachilinae) involved are osmiines, species of Wainia (Caposmia) Peters and Hoplitis (Anthocopa) Lepeletier and Serville, and anthidiines, including Afranthidium (Afranthidium) hamaticauda Pasteels, all cavity nesters using empty snail shells. The only other aculeate recorded as using empty shells is Alastor ricae Giordani Soika (Vespidae: Eumeninae). Parasitism in bee nests in snail shells is uncommon. Only Chrysis Linnaeus (Chrysididae) and Eupelminae (Chalcidoidea: Eupelmidae) were found, each at only two sites. The preferred snail shells are those of several species of Trigonephrus Pilsbry (Dorcasiidae) on the west coast and in the desertic areas and of Tropidophora ligata (MÃ¼ller) (Pomatiidae) along the south coast to the east, all indigenous species. In some areas the habitats of these have been invaded by an exotic snail, Theba pisana (MÃ¼ller) (Helicidae). Shells of this snail are used to a limited extent by the smaller nesters in snail shells. This exotic snail presents a threat to the indigenous snails and to the snail shell nesters. In some areas ongoing coastal development is also a threat.
