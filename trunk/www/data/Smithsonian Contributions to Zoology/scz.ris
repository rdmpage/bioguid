N2  - A small collection of stomatopods taken during the course of an ecological survey by the University of Capetown has provided the author the opportunity of redescribing the rare Lysiosquilla capensis Hansen, a species restricted to southern African waters. Analysis of the large series of Pterygosquilla armata (H. Milne-Edwards), which also has populations off South America and New Zealand, supports an earlier suggestion that the three populations are subspecifically distinct. The collection also includes several new records for southern African waters.

N2  - Two families of Bethyloidea are known to occur on Dominica: Bethylidae and Dryinidae. The family Bethylidae is represented by 19 species, of which 13 are here described as new. The two genera most commonly collected and containing the largest number of species are Parasierola and Goniozus; each genus contains 5 species on Dominica, and keys are presented for separating these species. The remaining genera are Apenesia and Dissomphalus (3 species each) and Pseudisobrachium, Anisepyris, and Holepyris (1 species each). Of the 19 species, only 6 are known to occur on other islands, one of these also on continental South America. The family Dryinidae is represented by one species of Mesodryinus and one species of Prodryinus, both described as new and both so far as known restricted to Dominica.

N2  - Recent ostracodes of the marine family Pontocyprididae may be identified as easily by the carapace as by appendage characteristics, especially by the five discrete central muscle scars. The five genera and three subgenera are each distinguished by a diagnostic arrangement of the muscle scars, as well as by carapace shape and characters of the appendages and genitalia.From collections of the International Indian Ocean Expedition, from other collections at the Smithsonian Institution, and from the type "Challenger" material of Brady (1880), 48 species and 2 subspecies (12 new, 8 pre-existing, 30 in open nomenclature) are described here and assigned to four genera. Two new subgenera, Ekpontocypris and Schedopontocypris, are established within the genus Propontocypris.The following species and subspecies are new: Propontocypris (Propontocypris) crocata, P. (P.) quasicrocata, P. (P.) paradispar, P. (P.?) lobodonta, Propontocypris (Ekpontocypris) litoricola, P. (E.) l. litoricola, P. (E.) l. admirantensis, P. (E.) mcmurdoensis, P. (E.?) epicyrta, Propontocypris (Schedopontocypris) bengalensis, Australoecia mckenziei, A. abyssophilia.

N2  - Morphology, biology, and variability of a new genus with four new species are described from collections of deep-sea ostracods obtained by the Lamont Geological Observatory and Woods Hole Biological Laboratory in the Atlantic, Antarctic, and Indian Oceans. Adult females far outnumber males in collections, but juvenile males and females are present in equal numbers indicating that adult males are short lived. Microtome sections of male and female genitalia document that the male transfers sperm to the female in ovoid spermatophores which are attached externally. Examination of stomachs shows that members of the new genus are carnivoresâ€”feeding on copepods, ostracods, and nematodes. Apparently adult males do not eat. A key is presented for identification of early instar stages by means of examination of sixth and seventh limbs.

T1  - An Analysis of Nesting Mortality in Birds
JO  - Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology

VL  - 9
SP  - 1
EP  - 48
UR  - http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Zoology/sc_RecordSingle.cfm?filename=SCTZ-0009
N2  - This study was initiated to evaluate nesting mortality of birds as a feature of the environment and as a selective force in the evolution of reproductive strategies. Representative nesting-success data from the literature for most groups of birds were transformed into daily mortality rates to eliminate differences among species in the length of the nest cycle. These data are presented by taxonomic groupings and for passerines by geographical region and nest construction and placement.The strength and pattern of various mortality factors are described in detail. Predation, starvation, desertion, hatching failure, and adverse weather are the most prevalent factors, but nestsite competition, brood parasitism, and arthropod infestation may be important in some species. It is demonstrated that the various mortality factors can be identified by characteristic patterns of nesting losses involving differences in mortality rates between the egg and nestling periods and the within-nest component of mortality rates.Among Temperate Zone passerines, field-nesting and marsh-nesting species have the highest mortality rates while those species nesting in trees, especially in cavities, enjoy higher success. Starvation is prevalent in marsh and field species but desertion is more restricted to tree-nesting species. In general, arctic species have lower mortality rates and tropical species higher rates, although there is a similar gradient from arid to humid regions within the tropics. The relative abundance of a species is related directly to its mortality rate in arctic regions, but is not in temperate and tropical regions.Birds of prey generally have low mortality rates although starvation is often a major factor. Nesting losses in seabirds are caused primarily by crowded conditions in colonies and loss of eggs due to inadequate nest construction. Chick deaths come about primarily through their wandering away from parental care which is most common in the semiprecocial Charadriiformes. Precocial shorebirds and water birds enjoy higher egg success than ground-nesting passerines but game birds exhibit similar mortality rates. Little is known of the survival of precocial chicks after hatching except that mortality rates may be initially quite high and decrease with age. The fate of altricial birds after fledging is also poorly documented.It is postulated that interspecific differences in mortality rates are determined by evolutionarily acceptable levels of adult risk to lower mortality rates of offspring through parental care, adult adaptations of morphology and behavior for foraging which result in limitations on nesting adaptations, environmental unpredictability which reduces the effectiveness of adaptations, andâ€”most importâ€”the diversity of predators to which a species must adapt.

T1  - Checklist of Amphibians and Reptiles of Barro Colorado Island, Panama, with Comments on Faunal Change and Sampling
JO  - Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology

SP  - 1

N2  - One hundred species of amphibians (32) and reptiles (68) are estimated to occur on Barro Colorado Island, on the basis of approximately 47 years of collecting. The island is a seasonally wet, tropical forest locality in man-made Gatun Lake, central Panama. The faunal composition has not been static since the island's formation in 1912-1914. Some species have disappeared from the island whereas some others seem to be recent arrivals. Faunal change is at least partly correlated with vegetational succession, as old clearings change toward mature forest. The extirpation of certain "edge" species and their failure to have recolonized the laboratory clearing indicates that it is easier for a resident population to become extinct than for new colonization to occur. The sampling of such a complex, tropical herpetofauna is shown to be not so difficult as might be expected. Man-hours of collecting are plotted against percent of the herpetofauna for several collections, indicating that nearly one-half of the species can be collected in a few weeks of intensive effort in the rainy season. Approximately 80 percent of the species recorded from the island had been collected by 1931, after only about a decade of sporadic, unsystematic collecting by various persons. The generalization that tropical species have lower population densities than temperate species may not be valid for such groups as frogs and lizards but does seem true of snake faunas in low, humid forest regions. Snakes also are more difficult to collect in the tropics because of shifts in habits. There is a great expansion of tropical snakes into arboreal situations and a general avoidance (by all vertebrates) of rock and log microhabitats, which are frequently occupied by large arachnids. Small terrestrial snakes of lowland tropical forests tend either to be fossorial or to inhabit the leaf litter, where they are difficult to detect. Seasonal aggregations of snakes are rare in the wet tropics.

N2  - This, the second major paper on scarid fishes by the author, discusses several difficult-to-identify species and brings together under one taxon certain males and females, previously thought to represent two or more species. Taxonomically controversial genera and species in the late Dr. J. L. B. Smith's two major papers (1956, 1958) on parrotfishes are correlated with conclusions reached in this report.Included is a current descriptive list (with 38 color illustrations) of 11 genera, 5 subgenera, 68 species, and 5 subspecies. Important taxonomic changes: Scarus fehlmanni, new species from the Red Sea, is placed in the subgenus Xenoscarops Schultz along with Scarus perrico (Jordan and Gilbert). The genus Scarus ForskÃ¥l is divided into three subgenera: Scarus ForskÃ¥l, Xenoscarops Schultz, and Callyodon Scopoli. Sparisoma Swainson is divided into two subgenera: Callyodontichthys Bleeker and Sparisoma Swainson. Scarops Schultz is monotypic. Pseudoscarus jordani Jenkins, Callyodon africanus Smith, and Scarus paluca Gosline and Brock are synonyms of Scarops rubroviolaceous (Bleeker). Bolbometopon Smith, with Cetoscarus Smith as a synonym, has two species: B. muricatus Cuvier and Valenciennes and B. bicolor (RÃ¼ppell). Scarus pulchellus RÃ¼ppell is the adult female of B. bicolor. Ypsiscarus Schultz has two species, Y. ovifrons (Temminck and Schlegel) and Y. oedema Snyder. Scarus harid ForskÃ¥l has three subspecies: harid ForskÃ¥l, longiceps Cuvier and Valenciennes, and vexillus (Smith). Hipposcarus schultzi Smith is a synonym of S. h. longiceps. Scarus microrhinos Bleeker and S. strongylocephalus Bleeker are synonyms of S. gibbus RÃ¼ppell.Neotypes were established for Scarus psittacus ForskÃ¥l, Scarus forsteri Cuvier and Valenciennes, and S. sordidus ForskÃ¥l. A lectotype was selected for Scarus quoyi Cuvier and Valenciennes. Also lectotypes were selected for Scarus baliensis Bleeker, S. bataviensis Bleeker, S. quoyi Cuvier and Valenciennes.

N2  - This conference was conceived by William Vogt, who is well known for his early concern with the ecological consequences of the human population explosion, as expressed in his book Road to Survival (New York: William Sloane Associates, 1948). Over three decades of field observation in Latin America have provided him with a view of environmental changes, particularly the destruction of forest vegetation, that few other scholars have experienced. The conference was convened to determine, through an exchange of information, whether the drastic modification and elimination of the wintering habitat of many breeding birds of North America may be responsible for depressed levels of populations.The assemblage of most of the outstanding scholars of bird life in Central America, Colombia, and Venezuela at the Smithsonian Institution resulted in a remarkable accumulation of information and exchange of ideas. Fourteen individual papers were presented, each of which was followed by discussion. Further discussion took place in a plenary session after the papers on the individual countries. In lieu of resolutions the conferees agreed on a series of suggestions which are presented in these proceedings.The conference was organized by the Smithsonian Office of Ecology, and made possible by a generous grant from the Conservation Foundation.We would like to express our gratitude to Paul Slud, Associate Curator, Division of Birds, National Museum of Natural History, for verifying the spelling of scientific names and for his considerable assistance with the final editing.The Editors

N2  - Tenrecs are found only on the island of Madagascar. The biology of the Tenrecidae is described by field and laboratory studies that focused on comparisons of social behavior and communication in several species. Detailed observations on the behavior of Echinops, Setifer, Tenrec, Hemicentetes, and Microgale are related to ecological adaptations of each genus.Experimental manipulations of Hemicentetes revealed that a sound-producing organ composed of dorsal quills functions to coordinate the movements of mother and infants. Evolutionary trends in structure and behavior of the tenrecs are discussed. The mammalian feeding niches of Panama and Madagascar are compared.

N2  - The Rufous-naped Tamarin, Saguinus geoffroyi, is a rather small species of Panama and northern Colombia. It is diurnal, slightly gregarious, omnivorous (with a preference for insects), quadrupedal, and most characteristic of dense scrub and low forest in areas of medium humidity. It interacts with some other species in peculiar ways which may involve social mimicry. It has a few tactile and olfactory signals, a moderate number of vocalizations, and many kinds of visual signals, mostly displays. The communication systems of other members of the genus seem to be similar. They all include points of resemblance to both the Night Monkey, Aotus, and the marmosets, Callithrix and Cebuella. Some of the resemblances are difficult to interpret. The phylogenetic relationships among the three types, and between them and Callicebus, remain thoroughly obscure. There must have been considerable parallel or convergent evolution of either behavioral or morphological characters during the history of the group.

N2  - The Cerviniidae found in abyssal and bathyal catches of Cruise 8 of R/V Anton Bruun are discussed. In eight stations off the East African Coast 15 species of Cerviniidae have been found. The genus Pontostratiotes Brady is represented by six new species, by specimens which belong probably to the three previously known species of the genus, and an as yet uncertain species. A new genus is established for Ameliotes malagassicus, new genus, new species. Two other new species belong to the genera Cerviniella Smirnov and Cerviniopsis Sars. Two other species found in the collections of Vityaz from the Pacific abyssal are found also in this material. The genus Pontostratiotes is discussed, and a new diagnosis of the genus is given.Adequate gear yielded rich collections of abyssal Harpacticoids of which the present material is only a small part. A few general conclusions about this fauna are advanced.

T1  - Taxonomy, Sexual Dimorphism, Vertical Distribution, and Evolutionary Zoogeography of the Bathypelagic Fish Genus Stomias (Stomiatidae)

N2  - New information on the characters and geographic distribution and a key for identification are presented for the ten recognized species and subspecies of Stomias, of which one, the eastern Atlantic subspecies S. colubrinus orientalis Blache, is considered a full species and is redescribed. The name orientalis, a junior homonym, is replaced by lampropeltis. External sexual dimorphism is demonstrated for all species in three characters: males are smaller than females and have larger eyes and larger postorbital photophores. The magnitude of the dimorphism varies among the species, the most extreme differences in eye and postorbital organ occurring in species in which males attain the least maximum size. Vertical distributions of all except S. danae are estimated by comparing numbers of specimens caught in nonclosing nets with the number of meter-hours of trawling at depth in the known geographic range of each form. All appear to migrate from deeper to shallower depths at night. Most species for which data approach adequacy occur in the greatest abundance between 500-1000 meters during daylight and in the upper 200 meters at night, although concentrations of S. gracilis are deeper than 200 meters at night. In S. colubrinus, however, greatest daytime catches are below 1000 meters and at night below 600 meters. The apparent phylogenetic trends of morphological characters, together with present geographical distributions, suggest that S. brevibarbatus and S. danae represent the earliest evolved stock of Stomias, from which, perhaps simultaneously, the colubrinus-lampropeltis group and S. nebulosus arose. The S. boa group probably arose from nebulosus-like ancestors, with the almost circumtropical S. affinis the earliest and giving rise to S. atriventer in the eastern Pacific and S. boa boa in the Subtropical Convergence, and the latter giving rise to S. gracilis in subantarctic and Antarctic waters and, most recently, to S. boa ferox in the North Atlantic as well as a Mediterranean population that has retained boa boa characteristics.

N2  - Gammaridean Amphipoda from depths of 0-30 m on hard bottoms are increased from about 40 to about 120 species, including 59 new species and 9 new genera and subgenera. About half of the species is endemic. Nearly 70 percent of the faunule has come from archipelagoes to the southwest of Hawaii, but only 15 percent of the faunule is of tropicopolitan character. About 20 percent of the fauna has affinities with cool waters of the North Pacific. This is the first significant record of cool-water species of any marine group in Hawaii. Most of these species have a tubicolous ecology, suggesting that nestlers are less successful in completing the long journey from the cool waters of northern continents. All but three species with cool-water affinities have diverged specifically from their mainland ancestors and at least two require erection of new genera to describe their divergence. Other endemic genera of Hawaii have low affinities with tropical Pacific faunas and have affinities with places like Antarctica, the Caribbean Sea, and warm-temperate Australia. The tropical component of Hawaiian Gammaridea is not impoverished by a priori standards of diversity. Few elements expected to occur in Hawaii are missing. No evidence of interisland adaptive radiation has been observed, but several pairs and triads of species with sibling affinities are described as a result of successive waves of immigration of parent species. Since no cool-water stepping stones occur between Hawaii and cool mainland shores of the North Pacific, the divergent cool-water species of Hawaii probably reflect morphological changes occurring after one increment of isolation. Some of these fairly radical changes such as loss of palp articles, coalescence of urosomites, and possibly axial reversal of dominance in gnathopods are seen to be of lower conservative value than heretofore accorded. This upsets classifications in Atylidae, Dexaminidae, Aoridae, and Isaeidae to a significant degree.

N2  - Specimens of Proechimys from 12 localities in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru, were studied to assess the degree of variation in bacular, cranial, and dental morphology, and pelage. Coefficients of variation and Student's t values were computed for selected cranial measurements to evaluate intra- and interpopulation variation. Studies on tooth wear demonstrated considerable variation in dental occlusal pattern and suggested that taxonomic assignment based entirely on dental morphology may be misleading. Descriptions and illustrations of bacula from most localities indicate that these bones are highly variable in overall dimensions, but have common structural features at a particular locality. Most specimens are tentatively referred to Proechimys guyannensis, although P. canicollis, P. quadruplicatus, and P. steerei were also represented. Proechimys guyannensis is regarded as a highly variable species. It is suggested that subspecific delimitation may not adequately express the variation observable in this species.

N2  - The family Eulepethidae is reviewed and revised, based on a reexamination of most of the previous records in the literature. The family characteristics are summarized and its systematic position among the other families of the superfamily Aphroditoidea is discussed.The family is represented by four genera: Eulepethus Chamberlin (=Eulepis Grube), with a single species; Pareulepis Darboux, including two species and one synonym; Mexieulepis Rioja, with a single species and one synonym; and Grubeulepis, new genus, including four previously described species and three new species. In addition, Eulepis challengeriae McIntosh is considered questionable.

N2  - Serpulids which had been classified in the genera Vermilia, Miroserpula, Chitinopoma, Chitinopomoides, Hyalopomatus, Hyalopomatopsis, Cystopomatus, and Protis are examined and discussed.The genus Miroserpula should be included in the genus Chitinopoma, as the type-species of both genera are identical. C. serrula, single known species of the genus Chitinopoma, is widely distributed in the Arctic and Boreal Atlantic (America and Eurasia). It is characterized by incubation in special brood chambers on the tube of adult specimens. As C. groenlandica, it has often been confused with a quite different species from the Pacific coast of North America. For this latter species, first described as Hyalopomatopsis occidentalis, the new genus Pseudochitinopoma has been created. Chitinopomoides wilsoni, an insufficiently known species from bathyal depths off Antarctica, may have some affinities with the genus Chitinopoma. Affinities of Chitinopomoides with the genera Spirobranchus and Serpula are excluded.The bathyal and abssyal forms from the Atlantic (Arctic Basin, Azores, Madeira) and from the Mediterranean, described under the generic names Hyalopomatus and Hyalopomatopsis, and the bathyal Cystopomatus from Antarctica, are closely related. The latter two genera are to be considered as synomyms of the former. The validity of the specific distinctions of these forms, based on the known material, is questionable.The genus Protis, known from the Atlantic and Pacific, includes forms which in Arctic regions may be found in lesser depths, but which are at least bathyal when not abyssal at lower latitudes (Azores, Romanche deep, Gulf of Mexico, off California). The specific distinctions of these forms are questionable. A serpulid from the infralittoral at Puerto Rico, described as P. torquata, does not belong to the genus Protis.

N2  - A key is given to the species groups of Anthrax in North and South America. Four of the five groups are described and keys are given for included taxa. Each taxon is fully described, its synonymy is compiled, and its distribution is illustrated or summarized. Important taxonomic characters are illustrated. Sixteen taxa comprise the oedipus group, including peruvianus, cordillerensis, and insulanus, new species, and irroratus striatipennis, oedipus aquilus, and pluto nigriventris, new subspecies. Twenty-nine taxa comprise the cephus group, including innubilipennis, inaquosum, nitidus, xanthomeros, hylaios, cathetodaithmos, snowi, costaricensis, koebelei, austrinus, clinopictus, and laticellus, new species; and argyropygus painteri, new subspecies. Nine species comprise the trimaculatus group, including baliopteros, latibasis, and caatingensis, new species. Five taxa comprise the tigrinus group, including xylocopae, new species, and simson habrosus, new subspecies. Evolution of the cephus and tigrinus groups is discussed.

N2  - Three important biotic assemblages and several minor associations occur on the soft bottoms of San Quintin Bay. The most obvious assemblage is characterized by the eelgrass, Zostera marina, that covers approximately 20 percent of the study area. A second densely populated assemblage occurs in tidal channels and on their margins and is dominated by a globular ascidian, Eugyra glutinans, and a tube-forming amphipod, Ampelisca compressa. That community merges with a poorly populated Prionospio (polychaete) community occupying sand flats in shallow, quiet water; the two are asymmetrically connected by a facies (or ecotone) characterized especially by two genera of amphipods, Acuminodeutopus and Rudilemboides. A less widespread fourth assemblage, dominated by a polychaete genus Fabricia, occurs primarily adjacent to marshes, especially in the inner reaches of the lagoon. Three phases of the Prionospio community occur, the typical phase and phases dominated by the polychaetes Scoloplos acmeceps and Cossura candida. The Ampelisca-Eugyra community also exists in extreme phases dominated by either of the principal members.The Prionospio community is interpreted as a base community representing a penetration from the open sea of an analogous community in shallow waters on which is imposed the Zostera community where suitable banks are elevated above the surrounding flats. The Zostera community has few elements in common with the Phyllospadix (surfgrass) community of the open sea. The Eugyra-Ampelisca community occurs mainly in channels and at the feet of banks where water motion is highest in the bay. The Eugyra-Ampelisca community is unique to the literature but has affinities with open-sea Tellina communities.San Quintin has few of the cosmopolitan taxa usually introduced into bays by humans. The warm-temperate lagoons of California and Baja California have few common denominators probably because of changes imposed by man. Very few species in San Quintin are obligatory inhabitants of lagoons.San Quintin is unusual in being controlled physiographically by cinder cones; the west arm is a typical lagoon, whereas the east arm has characteristics of a drowned river valley.A hypothetical system of lagoonal maturation and senescence is proposed in which the depositional influences are accelerated by soft-bodied benthic biota.

N2  - The crane fly fauna of the Antillean island of Dominica is discussed, based in chief part on a study of the extensive series of specimens collected by various staff members in entomology of the United States National Museum between 1956 and 1966. The only other island of the Lesser Antilles that had been studied in some detail is Saint Vincent, by Williston (1896). Two islands of the Greater Antilles have been discussed by Alexander, Puerto Rico (1932) and Jamaica (1964a). In this report on Dominica 64 species of Tipulidae are discussed, of which 26 are described as new. Virtually all belong to the subfamily Limoniinae, with only 3 species, distributed in as many genera, in the Tipulinae. In the Limoniinae, 3 tribes are represented, the largest being the Limoniini with 32 species or exactly one-half of those presently known from the island. The largest single genus is Limonia Meigen, with 29 species arranged in 6 subgenera, the largest such groups being Geranomyia Haliday with 13 species and Rhipidia Meigen with 8. The second most important tribe is the Eriopterini, with 23 species belonging to 7 genera, the largest genus being Gonomyia Meigen with 10 species in 4 subgenera. The third tribe, the Hexatomini, has only 6 species in 5 genera. Only 2 genera, Limonia Meigen and Gonomyia Meigen, have 10 or more species. Of the total of 28 genera and subgenera in the Dominican fauna no fewer than 19 are represented by a single species each. The following new taxa are described:Eriopterodes, new genus; Nephrotoma dominicana, new species; Tipula (Microtipula) carib, new species; Limonia (Caenoglochina) wirthiana, new species; L. (Dicranomyia) clarkeana, new species; L. (Neolimonia) gurneyi, new species; L. (Geranomyia) caribica, new species; L. (G.) neptis, new species; L. (G.) spangleri, new species; L.

N2  - Internal as well as external skeletal features support the decision to divide the shallow water tropical genus Ophiocoma into species groups. Differences in embryological and larval morphology also suggest partition of the genus. Two species formerly in Ophiocoma are now placed in the new genus Clarkcoma (type-species, Ophiocoma canaliculata LÃ¼tken). The relationship of the oral papillae and buccal tentacle scale, sequence of arm spines, and nature of oral and dental plates have been analyzed in order to reach conclusions regarding the taxonomic position of the taxa. These characters also suggest intergeneric relations within the subfamily. Descriptions and keys are given for the two genera as well as for the intrageneric groups and species of Ophiocoma; also, the specific limits of many species are reviewed.

N2  - Calanoid Copepoda from 2,000 m to 4,000 m were collected with closing nets on R.V. Trident cruises 023 and 036 in the North and South Atlantic. Both the Nansen vertical net and the large Clarke-Bumpus net are liable to contamination from surface-living species. Of 1,556 calanoid copepods examined, 310 were considered contaminants, 243 were adults, and 1,003 were juveniles.Abundance of calanoid adults (excluding contaminants) was varied but always less than 29 adults/100 m3. These results are consistent with other investigations. The ratio of numbers of species to numbers of individuals increases with decreasing latitude when data from other Atlantic collections are included. Existing hypotheses explaining latitudinal gradients in diversity do not apparently apply to the 2,000-4,000 m interval. Diversity in the deep sea is probably echoing that of upper levels. The species assemblage is cosmopolitan, with many species occurring in all oceans.The total length of adult calanoid copepods averaged 2.14 mm, a value consistent with size ranges found in samples from other oceans.Sixty percent of the species were represented by females only. Three species, known only from below 2,000 m, were represented by males and females in the same tows. The presence of spermatophore sacs on some females and the large number of juvenile stages indicate some reproduction is occurring at depth.Available alternatives for the nutrition of deep-sea Copepoda are other zooplankton, organic aggregates, autochthonous unicellular organisms, organic matter transported downward, and detritus.Four new species are described: Mimocalanus sulcifrons, Paivella naporai, Undinella gricei, and Zenkevitchiella tridentae, with systematic remarks for eight others, including two species (Aetideopsis retusa and Scolecthricella timida) not previously known from the Atlantic Ocean.

N2  - The introduction of aquatic animals from foreign lands to the waters of the United States is not a new problem, but it is rapidly accelerating, particularly because of the increase in quantity and in kinds of fishes entering the aquarium trade. The introduction of each fish species that is judged to be established is reviewed with respect to place of origin, mode of transport, area of release, and rationale. Transplants of native fishes from one drainage to another or from one end of the country to the other, though often resulting in harm to local faunas, are only reviewed in a cursory manner.Twenty-five species of exotic fishes are now established in waters of the United States exclusive of Hawaii. They include one trout (Salmonidae), six minnows (Cyprinidae), one loach (Cobitidae), one catfish (Clariidae), five livebearers (Poeciliidae), two drums (Sciaenidae), seven cichlids (Cichlidae), and two gobies (Gobiidae). Except for the gobies and drums, all are freshwater species. Many other exotic species have been caught in our waters, but their establishment is not yet demonstrated.The areas affected vary considerably, from local warm springs, in which the exotic species probably could be eliminated, to large and interconnected systems in which no amount of money or effort could remove the introduced animal.Introductions have been both purposeful and accidental. Though sometimes well intentioned, they have never been preceded by a thorough study of the possible effect of the species in question on the local biota. Where purposeful, introductions have usually involved a single organization which has acted on the basis of its own limited interests.Particular attention is given to Florida and Hawaii, the states most affected by introductions. They differ markedly in the nature of the problem since in Hawaii freshwater drainages are isolated and small, whereas Florida's fresh waters are extensive and interconnected by canals. Most of the 64 million fishes imported into the United States each year enter through southeastern ports, especially Miami and Tampa. The growth of the aquarium industry in Florida, and careless management of its holding tanks or ponds, has resulted in the introduction and establishment of species that serve no useful purpose and can only offer competition with native fishes.Brief consideration is given to aquatic plants and invertebrates, both groups of which have created major and expensive control problems.Although the problems raised by aquatic animals already introduced into our waters are serious, they threaten to become much worse if meaningful control and regulation of imported animals is not quickly forthcoming. The biological pathway involved in the role of introductions is their establishment through reproduction, and their competition with, and in some cases, extinction of native fauna. Recommendations are made to assist the control of introductions, and the resolutions of a recent conference on this subject are repeated.

N2  - The history of the suprageneric classification within the Hydroptilidae is reviewed and the subfamily Leucotrichinae is established for an exclusively New World group of genera: Leucotrichia Mosely, Peltopsyche MÃ¼ller, Zumatrichia Mosely, Costatrichia Mosely, Abtrichia Mosely, Acostatrichia Mosely, Betrichia Mosely, Alisotrichia Flint, and Anchitrichia, new genus. Five genera, all restricted to North and Central America and the West Indies, are keyed and characterized, both for the adult and larval stage. Leucotrichia, the type genus of the subfamily, contains ten species, four described as new, and is known from all sections. Costatrichia contains six species, four described as new, and is known from Central America only. Anchitrichia, containing only spangleri, new species, is described as new and is known from throughout Central America. Zumatrichia, containing nineteen species, thirteen described as new, is the largest genus and is abundant in Central America and the Lesser Antilles, with one species Z. notosa (Ross) (new combination) found in Montana. Alisotrichia contains twelve species, five described as new, and is known from Central America and the West Indies. Each species is keyed, figured, described, its affinities discussed, and its distribution given. The larvae are described for the species for which this stage is known.

N2  - An account of the known Dermaptera of Dominica is presented, largely based on material collected during the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian Biological Survey of Dominica. This material is now in the United States National Museum. Of the nine species of the order in the material examined, six are new records for the island, and one of these is described as new. One additional new record for Dominica, based on a specimen in the Manchester Museum, is included, and all known previous records of Dermaptera from the island are given, making a total of thirteen species now known from Dominica.The composition of the Dermaptera fauna of Dominica, and the relation of the various species to other species found in the West Indies, or species found on the mainland of South, Central, or North America, is discussed.A short account of the structure of the male genitalia and the taxonomy of the Dermaptera is included, together with the biology and distribution of the order. Keys to all families or subfamilies of the New World Dermaptera are given, together with keys to, and figures of, all genera and species recorded from Dominica. The figures either show the entire insect, or show the male or female forceps, the structure of the male forceps being one of the most important characters in taxonomy.

N2  - During a study of the Asteroidea of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, a new genus of the family Zoroasteridae was discovered. A general survey of the family revealed apparent relationships with the fossil Calliasterellidae and prompted the conclusion that both of these families were incorrectly placed in the order Forcipulatida. A new order, the Zorocallida, is therefore erected for the Zoroasteridae and Calliasterellidae. The new genus, Doraster, is described, with the type-species D. constellatus. Several other observations on the classification of the Zoroasteridae are made, including the synonymizing of three species of Zoroaster found in the Atlantic.

N2  - An experimental and observational study of the predatory behavior of Argiope argentata, a large orb-web spider, is reported in detail. The predatory behavior consists of a sequence of distinct behavior units. The sequence begins when the prey strikes the web and ends when the spider starts feeding or the prey escapes. Detailed description of all the behavior units that are known to be employed in predatory sequences are given. The units are functionally distinct and involve prey location, prey discrimination, prey immobilization, and prey transportation.Predatory sequences vary both in the units of behavior involved and in the duration of these units. Complete behavior sequences are described and analyzed. These sequences were given by adult spiders when they were presented with seven types of insect prey that differed taxonomically and/or physically. Further studies were made of the responses of spiders to both inedible artifacts and naturally occurring inedible objects.An extensive comparison is made of the sequences elicited by different types of prey and conclusions are drawn about the adaptive significance of the various attack and restraint strategies. The model of the predatory behavior of A. argentata proposed by Robinson (1969) is revised and recast. A picture of considerable complexity emerges from this study.

T1  - On the Ecology of the Caribbean Chitons Acanthopleura granulata Gmelin and Chiton tuberculatus LinnÃ©: Density, Mortality, Feeding, Reproduction, and Growth

N2  - Ecological studies on two tropical chiton species (Acanthopleura granulata, Chiton tuberculatus) including density, mortality, feeding, reproduction, and growth, were carried out along the shore on coral reefs in Puerto Rico and Panama. Spatial segregation is often complete in the vertical distributions of these chitons on the shore, Acanthopleura occurs at a high level and Chiton below mean sea level. Acanthopleura is usually less numerous, 1-8 individ./m2, but present at a higher biomass density, 17-21 gm/m2, than Chiton, 1-22 individ./m2 and 8-13 gm/m2. A 40 percent reduction in suitable habitat by hurricanes between 1962 and 1968 was probably the cause of a nearly equal decrease in the numerical density of the chitons. Biomass density per unit area remained essentially constant. Mortality results from low water exposure, dislodgment and abrasion, and probably from predation by shore birds and fishes. Feeding is primarily nocturnal, Acanthopleura feeds eight hours a day, and Chiton six to seven hours daily. Several species of blue-green, green and red algae, and a relatively large quantity of inorganic material, are browsed from the rock substratum. Breeding in both species is seasonal, principally confined to the late summer and autumn when sea-water temperatures are at a maximum. A nearly 2:1 sex ratio in favor of males was found in sexually mature individuals, and larger chitons seemed to produce a proportionately greater amount of spawn. Spawning in Acanthopleura occurs in phase with the new and full moon; no marked rhythm was observed in Chiton. Multiple spawning of individuals probably occurs throughout the breeding season and the release of gametes is estimated to equal 5-10 percent of the dry weight standing crop in Acanthopleura and around 34 percent in Chiton. The rate of growth in both species is similar, equal to about 30-40 mm/yr. Sexual maturity is attained in one year. The bulk of the populations is composed of relatively young animals (<2 yrs.), indicating a rapid turnover.

N2  - The adults of 57 species of Hydrellia are described for the Nearctic Region. Adults of Hydrellia are semiaquatic and the larvae are leafminers in aquatic and semiaquatic plants. Twenty-one of the described species are new, and one represents a new geographic distribution record. Some or all of the immature instars of 18 species are described. The male terminalia and certain other critical characters are figured for the adults of 52 species. The larval feeding apparatus of 16 species and the puparia of 17 species are illustrated. Geographic distribution data are given for all species. New and previously recorded host plants are listed for several species, and other biological information such as habitats and behavior is given for most of the species. The general morphology of the genus, including morphology of the adult feeding apparatus and gut and internal genitalia, is discussed and illustrated. The general ecology of Hydrellia is discussed in regard to ecological role and distribution, parasitological data, dispersal and zoogeography, behavior, and environmental tolerance. Additional ecological data are included in checklists of known host plants and known hymenopterous parasites of Hydrellia. Literature pertinent to the genus is reviewed.

N2  - The genus Ecsenius comprises 18 species of Indo-Pacific reef-dwelling fishes. The species are generally characterized by a high degree of sexual dimorphism and geographic variation as indicated by statistically significant differences in average numbers of various meristic and proportional characters and color pattern types.Keys, illustrations and diagnoses, and nomenclatural and zoogeographical discussions are provided. Four new species are described: E. aroni from the Gulf of Aqaba, E. oculus from the western Pacific, E. bimaculatus from Borneo, and E. bandanus from Banda Island.A discussion is given of a particularly complex taxonomic problem involving three nominal species occurring in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba. E. nigrovittatus is known only from the southern Red Sea, E. frontalis is known from the northern Gulf of Aqaba to the Bay of Tadjoura (Gulf of Aden), and E. albicaudatus is known from the northern Gulf of Aqaba to the southern Red Sea. Except for color pattern all three forms are very similar morphologically, have been collected together from one small rock, and are very different from any other species of Ecsenius. The problem of whether the three forms constitute one or more species is not solvable presently, but the three nominal species are treated here as color pattern forms of single species, E. frontalis.

N2  - The blenniid tribe Salariini is characterized and a key is given to twenty-four genera we recognized in the tribe. Five of these genera (Alloblennius, Crossosalarias, Litobranchus, Mimoblennius, Nannosalarias) are here described as new. All genera are diagnosed and comments are given on their relationships, nomenclature, distribution, and estimated number of species. One genus, Medusablennius, previously placed in the tribe Blenniini is transferred to the Salariini. The approximately 350 nominal species of the Salariini are listed and each name is provided with a generic allocation. The institutional depository of primary type material, if known, is cited for each species. Some annotation to this list is made where there are involved nomenclatural problems. Three new species are described: Alticus simplicirrus from the Marquesas Islands; Crossosalarias macrospilus from the Solomon, Tonga, and Palau Islands, Great Barrier Reef, and South China Sea; and Mimoblennius cirrosus from the Gulf of Aqaba and Red Sea. Alloblennius jugularis (Klunzinger), A. pictus (Lotan), Litobranchus fowleri (Herre), Mimoblennius atrocinctus (Regan), and Nannosalarias nativitatus (Regan) are redescribed. All described and redescribed species and genera are figured, and illustrations of characteristic cephalic pore patterns are given for all genera and subgenera.Alloblennius pictus, one species treated, exhibited statistically significant differences in mean numbers of dorsal and anal fin rays and caudal vertebrae between specimens from the Gulf of Aqaba and the southern Red Sea. Mean numbers of these meristic characters were significantly different for males and females of the southern Red Sea specimens, but were not significantly different for the Gulf of Aqaba specimens.

N2  - The First International Conference on Meiofauna was held in Tunis, Tunisia, 1-11 July, 1969. Twenty-eight invited participants from seven countries assembled to review the status of the systematics and ecology of meiofaunal taxa, the ecology of meiobenthic communities, and techniques of faunal and environmental analyses. Of the 30 papers presented at the conference, 27 are included in this volume.The convening of the conference was stimulated by the increasing emphasis on and need for investigations of the systematics and ecology of meiofauna and for a means to provide an exchange of ideas between systematists and ecologists. Also it was felt that there was a need to standardize techniques of collecting and reporting data so that results from one area of investigation could be compared with those from another area. Toward this end, all participants contributed to "A Manual for the Study of Meiofauna" (Neil C. Hulings and John S. Gray, 1971, Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, Number 78).There remains much to be done in the sphere of meiofauna investigations. One of the most pressing problems is the need for more attention to the problem of sampling. Statistical evaluation of various techniques of sampling and statistical treatment of the sampling efforts are imperative. Not only must there be concern for individual species but also for the community as a whole. There must be continuous dialogue between systematists and ecologists to advance properly our knowledge of meiofaunal species and communities. Ultimately, the ecologist must consider all specimens to the species level. By the same token, the systematist must take into consideration taxa other than those of his particular interest. In this way he can provide taxa that are properly preserved for study by other systematists. It is through such consideration and cooperation that our knowledge of meiofauna will be increased greatly. These approaches assume an even greater significance when considering the effects of pollution on meiofauna.Other pressing problems exist in the area of the physiology of meiofauna. In terms of collecting and properly preserving specimens for study, what are the effects of various preservatives and anesthetizing agents now available? In the past, only the traditional agents have been used. New agents need to be evaluated, for it may be that these give better results than the traditional ones. To what degree do taxa, from the polar regions to the tropics, react differently to prepreservation storage and various extraction techniques? Preliminary evidence indicates the reaction is considerably different, and further evaluation of this aspect may result in greater extraction efficiency. This emphasizes the need for taking the local environmental conditions of the organism into consideration. Investigations in the area of culture of meiofaunal taxa must be accelerated to determine the degree of response to various environmental parameters.Such needs represent some of the more pressing problems in the study of meiofauna. These and other problems in the study of meiofuna are apparent in this volume and in the "Manual for the Study of Meiofauna." It is hoped that the papers presented in both publications will stimulate research along these and other lines.I am indebted to many persons for assistance in organizing the conference and in editing the papers of this volume. John S. Gray and Robert P. Higgins were of invaluable assistance in organizing and convening the conference. The personnel of the Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center, Salammbo, Tunisiaâ€”especially Dr. HÃ©dia Baccar, Mrs. GenÃ¨vieve Dargouth, and Mr. Mohammed Shiliâ€”freely provided assistance prior to and during the conference. The Tunisian governmentâ€”especially the National Scientific and Technical Institute for Oceanography and Fisheries, the Department of Higher Education and Scientific Research, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairsâ€”endorsed the conference and assisted in many ways. The American Embassy, Tunis, was most helpful on numerous occasions. Funding for the conference was made possible through the Office of International Activities of the Smithsonian Institution. The assistance of Dr. Ray Manning and his staff of the Department of Invertebrate Zoology, Smithsonian Institution, is gratefully acknowledged. And lastly, sincere appreciation is expressed to the authors of the papers in this volume for their patience and cooperation.Neil C.

N2  - Siphonodictyon (Adociidae, Porifera) was hitherto known only from one species Siphonodictyon mucosum Bergquist) from the Pacific Ocean. In the present paper the species is recorded also from the Indian Ocean. Two new species (Siphonodictyon cachacrouense, new species and Siphonodictyon coralliphagum, new species) are described from the Caribbean Sea. Based on morphological differences Siphonodictyon coralliphagum is divided into four forms (forma typica, forma obruta, forma tubulosa and forma incrustans). All species excavate burrows in coral skeletons. Another Caribbean species with sand-burrowing habit (Siphonochalina siphona de Laubenfels) is here transferred to Siphonodictyon. Based on the new material the definition of the genus is revised. Histological features and ecological data are discussed for all species.

N2  - Two polypharyngeal species of Phagocata are recognized: P. gracilis (Haldeman), which includes P. subterranea Hyman, and P. woodworthi Hyman. The distinguishing characteristics of the two species are described and illustrated. P. gracilis has a backward loop of each sperm duct before it enters the penial bulb, an elongated, pointed penis papilla, a fibrous layer below the epithelium of the papilla to which longitudinal muscles attach, a non-glandular antechamber to the glandular seminal vesicle, and lacks a sphincter on the bursal canal. In P. woodworthi the sperm ducts enter the bulb without forming a backward loop, the penis papilla is short and truncate, its outer muscle layer consists of alternating sheets of circular and longitudinal muscle fibers, the penial lumen is not differentiated into seminal vesicle and ejaculatory duct, and the bursal canal is very wide and is provided with a terminal sphincter. The morphology of the reproductive system, geographic distribution, ecology, and life cycle of the two species are discussed in detail.

N2  - The entocytherid ostracod fauna of MÃ©xico and Cuba comprises four genera and 16 species, 12 of which are endemic to the former and three to the latter. The remaining species, Ankylocythere sinuosa, ranges northward from MÃ©xico into the southern part of the United States. Four of the Mexican endemics, Ankylocythere maya, A. toltecae, A. villalobosi, and Uncinocythere zaruri, have not previously been described. Following a brief historical summary are a cross index to associations between the entocytherids and their hosts, discussions of taxonomic characteristics and entocytherid associates, a resumÃ© of life-history studies, and postulates concerning the origin of the entocytherid fauna. The latter propose that the ostracod stocks reached MÃ©xico passively on crayfish hosts from the southern part of the United States in three major periods of migration: the earliest, prior to the Pliocene, resulted in the colonization of the Central Plateau, the area south of the Cordillera VolcÃ¡nica Transversal, and Cuba; a Pliocene invasion populated the Gulf slope immediately north of this volcanic mass; and a Recent migration introduced the only non-endemic entocytherid into northeastern MÃ©xico. The treatment of the species includes synonymies, complete bibliographic citations, diagnoses, locations of types, distribution, hosts, entocytherid associates, variations, and relationships.

The arterial patterns are relatively uniform in iguanids. All ofiguanids examined had carotid ducts, lacked a primary common carotid, andwith the exception of Iguana, the coeliac arose anterior to or adjacent to themesenteries. Variation was observed in the type of origin of the external carotidand sternohyoid, subclavians, and mesenteries. These pairs of vessels could ariseseparately, contiguous, or form a common trunk.Ten arterial characters were analyzed to determine their taxonomic value.Comparison of similarly generated phenograms, one for arterial data and theother for extant iguanid data, showed the arterial characters to be of little valuefor intrafamilial classification. The arterial data can function only as a weakindicator of relationships.

N2  - The chub genus Nocomis Girard of North America is characterized and relationships among three species groups are discussed. Two new species are described from the central Appalachian region, both in the micropogon species group.The three species groups are defined and their characters are summarized; namely, the biguttatus group with three species, the micropogon group with three species, and the leptocephalus group with three subspecies. The central Appalachian region is inhabited by four species, N. micropogon (river chub), N. platyrhynchus, new species, (bigmouth chub) and N. raneyi, new species (bull chub) of the micropogon group, all of which are sympatric with N. leptocephalus (bluehead chub) in one or more river drainages. A key to these four species and a discussion of the nomenclatural history of the genus and nominal species are included. Important diagnostic characters useful in differentiating among the specific and several infraspecific populations are discussed, evaluated, and summarized in twenty-seven tables. An account of each species includes a synonymy, diagnosis, description, and comparison of meristic and morphometric characters, coloration in life and in preservation, population differentiation, reproduction, growth and size attained, materials studied and geographic distribution. The species are illustrated, special body features are drawn, distributions are plotted, and important character data are shown in thirty figures.The ecological requirements of the chubs are reviewed and species preferences discussed. Regional ecology is reviewed in respect to occurrence and abundance of the species. Associations, interrelationships and frequency of hybridization are compared among the four species. Differences are observed among the species of the micropogon group in their frequency of hybridization with N. leptocephalus.The biological and geological evidence providing an explanation of the dispersal of the chubs and other species of fishes in various interdrainage exchanges in the central Appalachian region is comprehensively reviewed. Possible routes of entry into the several drainages are proposed. Present, detailed distributional patterns of the chubs and other species are related with geologic events, and present and past ecological conditions in an effort to understand the conditions, barriers, and routes affecting dispersal. Three kinds of geological events that operated in the dispersal of chubs are considered: stream capture, eustatic changes of the Atlantic Coastal Plain, and Pleistocene drainage modifications. The discussion on the evolution of the species of Nocomis is based on morphology, coloration, zoogeography, and life history.

N2  - Until recently Nocomis Girard has been included as a subgenus in the polymorphic genus Hybopsis Agassiz along with Couesius Jordan and six additional nominal American cyprinid genera. Nocomis is diagnosed and recognized as a genus primarily on the basis of sexual dimorphic features, its mound-nest building behavior, general coloration, physiognomy, scale radii, and vertebral numbers. Nocomis and Couesius, also given generic rank, are probably more closely related to the genus Semotilus Rafinesque than to any group remaining in Hybopsis. Parexoglossum Hubbs is merged with Exoglossum Rafinesque and these are implicated to be related to Semotilus.Characters previously employed to diagnose Hybopsis are widely shared with other American cyprinids, such as the maxillary barbels which may be highly variable. Certain subgenera of Hybopsis are probably more closely related to other American cyprinid genera than to Hybopsis sensu stricto. Species of some subgenera of Hybopsis merit reallocation to other subgroups of Hybopsis or Notropis. Additional nomenclatural changes in Hybopsis are not recommended until more comprehensive studies are available.

N2  - This study treats the three allopatric species of the Nocomis biguttatus group: N. biguttatus, N. effusus, and N. asper, a new species. The systematics, distribution, ecology, evolution, and zoogeography of the species are compared. The region of the Ozark upland is emphasized because it is inhabited by the new species. N. asper is distinguished from N. biguttatus mainly in having a characteristic tuberculation pattern present on the body of the adults which never appears on the latter species. N. asper differs from N. effusus primarily in having two rows of pharyngeal teeth compared to one row in the latter, and in having about one fourth of its tuberculate body scales bearing two or more tubercles compared with only 3 percent bearing two tubercles in the latter species. The coloration of the nuptial males of the three species differs.Nocomis biguttatus is a wide-ranging form found naturally in the Missouri, upper Mississippi, northern Ohio, and the Great Lakes drainages. It avoids the nonglaciated regions of the upper Mississippi and Ohio drainages. This species is restricted to a few scattered populations in the middle and lower Missouri drainageâ€”evidence of a once more widely distributed species that has been largely extirpated from this drainage mainly by the erosional history of the area, increased agricultural practices, and by droughts. N. asper and N. effusus have restricted distributions on opposite sides of the Mississippi Valley. N. asper is contained chiefly in the Ozark upland of the Arkansas River drainage of the tri-state area of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, with probable isolated populations in the upper Neosho system of Kansas and in the Arkansas drainage of central Oklahoma, and a well-established population in the Blue River system, Red drainage, of south-central Oklahoma. Such isolated populations also are regarded as evidence of a wider distribution of these species in these drainages in the past. The disjunct populations of N. asper are paralleled closely by the occurrence of isolated populations of Notropis pilsbryi in the Arkansas River and Red River drainages. N. effusus is confined in the southwestern Ohio River basin to the Duck River system of the lower Tennessee drainage, the lower and middle Cumberland River drainage below its falls, and in the upper Green River drainage.The species of the biguttatus group chiefly inhabit tributaries and avoid the main rivers. Clear-water streams, small-to-moderate in size, with low-to-moderate gradients, and with clean substrates of gravel, rubble, and some sand, provide the preferred ecological requirements. Generally, the preferred streams have a moderate balance of riffles and pools. Turbid or silt-laden waters are avoided.The Nocomis biguttatus species group is considered to be the most primitive group within the genus; this assumption is based mainly on the generalized pattern of tuberculation on the head and on the presence of two rows of pharyngeal teeth. The primitive condition persists in N. biguttatus. The body tuberculation in N. asper and N. effusus (absent in N. biguttatus) demonstrates evolution of another type of tubercle pattern in Nocomis. The reduction in the number of tubercles per scale, the reduction in the distribution of tuberculate body scales, and the increase in the size of tubercles on the scales of the body of N. effusus are regarded as specialized conditions and correlate with the evolutionary trends of head tubercle development in the two other species groups of Nocomis.

N2  - Three subspecies of the bluehead chub, Nocomis leptocephalus (Girard), are recognized. Our conclusions are based on the examination of more than 20,000 specimens housed in American institutions. The typical form, N. l. leptocephalus, ranges from the Potomac drainage southward on the Atlantic slope to and including the Santee drainage, and across the Appalachian Divide into the New River. The new subspecies, N. l. interocularis, occurs in the Savannah, Altamaha, and Chattahoochee rivers and across the divide in a limited area of the Tennessee River in southeast Tennessee. The nominal form, N. l. bellicus, extends from the Alabama River westward to streams draining into the Mississippi River from the east in Louisiana and Mississippi, and in a limited area of the Tennessee River across the divide in northern Alabama.The diagnostic characters differentiating these subspecies are the number and distribution of head tubercles. These three populations have diverged almost to the species level. Intergrades of N. l. interocularis Ã— N. l. leptocephalus are recognized from the Edisto River, South Carolina. Two basic color forms are described, a blue and a brassy reddish, the evolutionary significance of which is not understood. The distribution of these two color forms does not correspond entirely to the distribution of the described morphological forms. The whorled intestine, a specific character of N. leptocephalus, is often straight in specimens from the Chattahoochee River.We postulate that in Nocomis, decrease in tubercle number and increase in tubercle size may represent a specialized condition that is especially demonstrated among the subspecies of N. leptocephalus.

N2  - About 100 species of epipelagic calanoid copepods occur in waters off the southeastern coast of the United States. From inshore waters seaward the species diversity increases from less than 10 species/station in coastal waters to more than 40 species/station in some oceanic stations. The species composition changes concomitantly, and, using the Fager-McGowan index of association, coastal, shelf, and oceanic associations have been identified, each with characteristic indicator species. The seaward gradient in diversity is explained by Sanders' stability-time hypothesis. The calanoid fauna south of Cape Hatteras is compared with the fauna north of Cape Hatteras.Two species of Paracalanus, P. quasimodo, new species, and P. indicus, new rank (=P. parvus var. indicus), both formerly referred to P. parvus, are described and compared with the more northern P. parvus. Taxonomic remarks are given concerning Rhincalanus cornutus, Pleuromamma gracilis and P. piseki, and Heterorhabdus papilliger.

N2  - The collections made by the Smithsonian-Bredin Expeditions to the Lesser Antilles and Virgin Islands in 1956, 1958, and 1959 and to Yucatan in 1960 contain 111 species of penaeidean, caridean, and stenopodidean shrimps, including 20 previously undescribed species. Diagnostic keys are offered to assist in the identification of the 170 shallow-water marine and fresh-water shrimps now known from the West Indian islands, as well as 48 species from adjoining geographic and bathymetric areas. References, type-localities, and distribution records are given for each of the 218 species treated, and habitat preferences are indicated for the species represented in the Smithsonian-Bredin collections. It is postulated that there is no endemic marine natantian fauna in the West Indies and that there are no natural barriers, except the local absence of suitable habitats, to the free distribution of most of the species in the region between the Florida Keys and Brazil; only 6 of the 70 marine species recorded from the Yucatan area have not yet been found at any of the islands in the West Indies.

N2  - Fixed heads of workers, drones, and queens of Apis mellifera Linnaeus were dissected under distilled water for the study of two tissues: the musculature and the nerve mass.Musculature: The movable and fixed points of muscle attachment were utilized in establishing a nomenclature for muscles to replace the systems in current usage, which depend on various combinations of topography, function, and numerical sequence. The present system proved to be consistent and useful for demonstrating the criteria of homology among muscles. Names were devised in classical Greek and Latin for international usage. For establishing muscle homology, every cephalic muscle of the three castes was compared with its homolog in other studied taxa of Hymenoptera and Neuroptera. The labial and epipharyngeal muscles are degenerate and the antennal muscles maintain primitive features. The mandibular complex consists of two well-developed muscles and a degenerate muscle which is probably modified to serve as a stretch organ. The maxillary muscles maintain the same points of attachment as in primitive insects, although the musculus tentorio-cardinalis has shifted its point of movable attachment to the stipes in the female bees to meet a change in function. The maxillary palpal muscles have disappeared as a result of the reduction of the palpus itself. Many of the labial muscles have shifted one or both points of attachment as a result of the specialization of the labium. The musculus postoccipiti-prementualis even has different points of fixed attachment among the different castes.As a result of simplification of the "hypopharynx," many of its muscles have shifted their points of attachment. The musculature of the clypeal walls are well developed to accommodate the enlargement and specialization of the cibarium.In this study the following undescribed muscles were found and named: musculus tentorio-mandibularis, m. stipiti-maxillopalpualis, m. oriscuto-supensorialis, and m. fronti-pharyngealis III (only in the drone).Nerve Tissue: Existing literature indicates that only a few of the cephalic nerves have been named. Accordingly, a new system was developed under which the name of each nerve or nervule is based on the structure it innervates. Main ganglia are named according to their locations, rather than following the traditional inconsistent nomenclature. The names are in classical Greek or Latin form for international usage. Every cephalic nerve or nervule was followed to its termination. When sufficient literature was available, the criteria of nerve homology were examined. Nerve topography follows a similar plan in the gnathal segments of the three castes, except that the Nervus Mandibularis is degenerate in the drone. It was noted that variation in the topographical plan of a particular nerve is very small, even among members of different castes.

N2  - The results of this study are based on a 14-month survey in Wilpattu National Park, Ceylon, covering an area of some 580 square kilometers in the lowland dry zone scrub jungle. Special attention was paid to the major ungulate species and data concerning abundance, seasons of reproduction, and feeding patterns are discussed. Although the elephant (Elephas maximus) exhibits the lowest numerical density, it accounts for the second highest biomass, exceeded in biomass only by the axis deer, which is also the most numerically abundant ungulate in the lowland dry zone of Ceylon. Special attention was paid to the role of the elephant in the dry zone ecosystem. Composition of social groupings, seasonal habitat utilization trends, general behavior patterns, and population structure are discussed for the elephant (Elephas maximus), water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis), axis deer (Axis axis), sambar (Cervus unicolor), muntjac (Muntiacus muntjac), wild swine (Sus scrofa), and mouse deer (Tragulus meminna). Certain aspects of the behavior of the major predators are also discussed, including the general biology of the golden jackal (Canis aureus) and the Ceylon leopard (Panthera pardus). Social organizations of the ungulate species are compared with special attention given to the mode of antipredator behavior exhibited by ungulates. Habitat utilization trends and comments on competition and ecological separation are included together with an estimate of numerical abundance and biomass for the major ungulate species. Recommendations for management of the park system are discussed.

N2  - A general survey of the systematics and distribution of the 36 species comprising the idoteid genus Synidotea is presented, followed by a more detailed account of the eight species represented in California. The characteristics of the Idoteinae are briefly reviewed, and the relationship of Synidotea to the other genera in this subfamily is indicated. Generic characters are discussed and the status of dubious species is clarified. The geographic, thermal, and bathymetric distributions of the included species are given. Most species of Synidotea occur in the Northern Hemisphere, predominantly in the Arctic-Boreal regions of the North Pacific. Distributional data, combined with paleoclimatic considerations, suggest the hypothesis that the North Pacific was its center of origin and radiation. It is thought that the genus originated in the late Mesozoic or early Cenozoic, when northern waters were much warmer than now, and that ancestral populations emigrated and speciated rapidly during the glacial Pleistocene. Lines of dispersal are postulated southward along both sides of the Bering arc, and northward into the Arctic through the Bering Strait. S. laticauda of San Francisco Bay is regarded as a relict descendant of an ancestral warmwater species, which also gave rise to the morphologically similar S. harfordi of southern California and the Sea of Japan. An association between size, latitude, and depth is indicated, with larger species occurring at higher (colder) latitudes and greater depths. Keys, descriptions, and ecological notes are given for the eight Californian species, including a new one from the central California coast, S. berolzheimeri.

N2  - Fourteen families of Australian Gammaridea from shallow marine waters in the warm-temperate zone are treated taxonomically. The family Dexaminidae, with 28 species in 5 genera, dominates the general amphipod fauna, though specimens are extremely abundant only on soft bottoms of embayments. Paradexamine, with 17 species occurring in Australia out of 35 now known in the Indo-Pacific-Antarctic region, has many sibling pairs and triads in Australia and probably represents a case of adaptive radiation, but the adaptations to special niches are even more apparent in genera such as Syndexamine, derived from Paradexamine. Syndexamine contains species with special morphological adaptations in the form of prehensile pereopods and a nonskid cuticle apparently as devices for attachment as commensals to sedentary hosts.Australian shallow waters have an especially significant number of species and endemic genera in the Dexaminidae, Eophliantidae, Phliantidae, Cyproideinae, and in the thaumatelsonin Stenothoidae, suggesting that Australia is a major evolutionary center for these taxa. Sibling radiation in a new genus with affinities to Pontogeneia plus the high significance of speciation in the families heretofore mentioned is discussed in a framework employing the principle of the ends-of-the-earth position of Australia in the world ocean. Relationships of the sublittoral fauna to Antarctica and to cold-temperate regions are especially low for a warm-temperate regime. Twelve new genera are described in the Amphilochidae, Colomastigidae, Dexaminidae, Eusiridae, Gammaridae, Phliantidae, and Stenothoidae. Evolutionary sequences in the Dexaminidae, Eophliantidae, Ceinidae, and Phliantidae are discussed. The carinate species formerly placed in Maera and Elasmopus are removed to a new genus similar to Parelasmopus.

N2  - The troglobitic members of the genus Orconectes, comprising six species and subspecies, are here assigned to the Pellucidus Section of the genus. Orconectes australis australis frequents spelean habitats along the eastern edge of the Cumberland Plateau from Alabama to Kentucky, where it intergrades with Orconectes australis packardi, which ranges as far north as Rockcastle County, Kentucky. Orconectes incomptus, new species, is known from only three localities at the base of the Highland Rim in Jackson County, Tennessee. Orconectes pellucidus ranges along the western flank of the Cincinnati Arch from Trigg County, Kentucky, and Montgomery County, Tennessee, northeastward to Hart County, Kentucky. The two subspecies of O. inermis occupy cave systems of the north Pennyroyal and Mitchell Plain in Kentucky and Indiana, the nominate subspecies occurring in the southern portion of the range and intergrading with the northern O. inermis testii from near the state line to Monroe County, Indiana. The four species are believed to have taken their origins from a wide-ranging, pre-Pleistocene, epigean stock which frequented streams of low gradient. With subsequent uplift of the area, the epigean derivatives of the stock for the most part became extinct, whereas the three or four derivatives that invaded subterranean habitats gave rise to the modern troglobites which occupy much of the original range of their ancestors. Complete bibliographic citations to these crayfishes and summaries of our present knowledge of them preceed a listing of all of the caves from which troglobitic Orconectes have been found, together with the identities of the crayfishes and previously reported epizootic ostracods.

N2  - Similarity coefficients calculated to show relationships between a number of geographic units are ranked for each unit, in order of descending values, and these ranked columns are then compared for all possible pairs of localities. The number of differences or discrepancies in position indicate close biotic relationship if low, or existence of a biotic barrier if high. The ranking of similarity coefficients permits use of all relationships known for a single locality. Earlier work established closeness of relationship on a single calculationâ€”the highest known similarity coefficient. Tests of the method were run on fish collections from transects in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, and on herpetological collections from Puerto Rico and neighboring islands. The technique is described and illustrated. The inadequacies of the numerical taxonomic techniques in dealing with biogeographic data are pointed out. The computer program used to analyze the data is included.

N2  - Large collections of birds made by A. D. Forbes-Watson in Kenya for the Smithsonian Institution from 1964 to 1966 contain many specimens that provide new information on the avifauna of that country. The populations of Ciccaba woodfordi and Pogoniulus bilineatus in the Sokoke Forest and Francolinus jacksoni in the Cherangani Mountains are believed to be distinct from neighboring races and are described as new subspecies in the text. Four species, previously unrecorded, from Kenya are listed. These are Caprimulgus pectoralis, Neocossyphus poensis, Nectarinia chloropygia, and Nectarinia bouvieri. Two species and one species that were thought, until recently, to have been extirpated or known only from the type are represented in the collection by Turdus fischeri fischeri, Platysteira concreta graueri, and Ploceus golandi. Taxonomic comments, including readjustments, revisions, and extensions of ranges are given for eight species and thirty subspecies. Birds recorded from two isolated forests of special interest, the Sokoke and Kakamega, are listed. The effects of human exploitation on the avifauna of these forests are given by A. D. Forbes-Watson in an appendix.

N2  - Nine different mimetic complexes involving 17 species of blenniid fishes and 4 species of nonblenniid fishes are reported. Eight of the complexes include genera of the blenniid tribe Nemophini (Aspidontus, two species, in one complex, Meiacanthus in six, Petroscirtes in two, and Plagiotremus in four), and three include a genus of the tribe Salariini (Ecsenius). Most of the study is devoted to an analysis of one complex involving three blenniid species: Meiacanthus nigrolineatus, Ecsenius gravieri, and Plagiotremus townsendi, from the Red Sea and Gulf of Aqaba. M. nigrolineatus and E. gravieri are almost identical in appearance. Both feed primarily on small invertebrates. P. townsendi, while similar in appearance to the other two species, is not a close mimic. It is a predatory species feeding primarily on the mucus and epidermis of scaled, nonpiscivorous fishes. M. nigrolineatus can inflict a noxious bite, which causes most native predators under laboratory conditions to reject it alive and unharmed after ingestion. E. gravieri is acceptable prey for native predators under laboratory conditions. P. townsendi is rejected as food by some species of native predators under laboratory conditions. The reasons for its rejection are unknown. The mimetic relationships among the three blenniids are involved and include elements of Batesian, MÃ¼llerian, and aggressive mimicry (in Wickler's sense: involving three or more species). E. gravieri is primarily a Batesian mimic of M. nigrolineatus. The two species are common and probably not different in relative abundance. The unusual situation of a close mimic's equaling the abundance of its model is explained in terms of the behavior of the two species, which result in the mimic's being less available than its model to predators, and the highly noxious quality of the model. P. townsendi is the least abundant of the three species. Quantitative information on intramimetic associations of the three species shows that they occur within less than one meter of each other a high percentage of the time and tends to support the idea that P. townsendi does not distinguish between either of the other two species at a distance. M. nigrolineatus and E. gravieri exhibit parallel geographic changes in color pattern.

N2  - The Aculeate wasp fauna of Dominica includes 52 species belonging to 10 families. Of these, 21 species belonging to 2 families of Bethyloidea were treated in an earlier paper; the remainder are treated here. These include 4 species of Tiphiidae, 1 Mutillidae, 1 Scoliidae, 1 Eumenidae, 1 Vespidae, 7 Pompilidae, and 15 Sphecidae. Eight species are described as new. Two of these are Pompilidae: Dipogon spangleri and Ageniella insulivaga. The remaining six new species are Sphecidae: Liris gryllicida, L. dominicana, L. sophiae, L. radulina, Trypoxylon layouanum, and Ectemnius dominicanus. Three new synonymies are indicated: Batazonus hookeri Rohwer and B. mundiformis Rohwer are placed in the synonymy of Poecilopompilus mixtus (Fabricius) (Pompilidae), and Larrada ignipennis Smith is placed in the synonymy of Liris labiata (Fabricius) (Sphecidae). A single record of a member of the family Chrysididae (Bethyloidea) is also included. Of the 31 species covered in this paper, 10 are confined to Dominica (so far as presently known), 8 occur widely in the Lesser Antilles, 4 are predominantly Greater Antillean species, 3 are probably arrivals from South America, and 6 are widely distributed Neotropical species.

N2  - The postembryonic development of three species of freshwater harpacticoid copepods from southern Georgia and southwestern Virginia has been studied. All of the larval stages (six nauplii and six copepodid stages) of Elaphoidella bidens coronata and Bryocamptus zschokkei alleganiensis, and all of the nauplii and two copepodid stages of Moraria virginiana were obtained, fully described, and figured. Where possible, the anatomical details were determined from the exuviae of a single individual.A key to the identification of the six naupliar stages of harpacticoids is given as well as a chart summarizing the major features of each copepodid stage.It is suggested that all life cycles of harpacticoid copepods in which fewer than six naupliar stages have been reported should be reexamined.

N2  - The family Ethmiidae is represented in the Americas by 133 species, or about half the world fauna. A classification is proposed, based on correlation of a traditional biosystematic approach with a numerical phenetic analysis of adult characters. The 133 species are assigned to 3 previously existing genera; 49 species are described as new, 11 from Nearctic North America, 4 from the West Indies, 25 from Neotropical Mexico and Central America, and 9 from South America. Keys to the species are provided, based on external features of the moths. Literature synonymy, descriptions of morphological aspects, type data, geographical ranges, and flight periods are given for each species. All knowledge of geographical distribution patterns, behavior and biology, and morphology of the larva, pupa, and adult of the world ethmiid fauna is analyzed in development of speculation concerning the systematic position and phylogenetic relationships of these moths (see summary at end of text).

UR  - http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Zoology/sc_RecordSingle.cfm?filename=SCTZ-0121
N2  - Twenty-seven photographs from seven deep-sea localities in the North Atlantic reveal cirrate octopods in their natural habitat. The photographs demonstrate that these octopods are benthopelagic, living just above the bottom at depths of 2,500 to greater than 5,000 m. Typical cephalopodan locomotion is exhibited as well as a drifting or hunting phase, and possibly a pulsating phase. Animals range in size from approximately 10 to 128 cm in total length, and up to 170 cm across the outstretched arms and webs. Scale size was determined mainly by a new technique termed shadow geometry, introduced here. Observations on shading ("coloration") indicate the possibility of "reverse coloration" on some specimens. Cirrates are more abundant in the Virgin Islands Basin than in other areas sampled. Additional photographs of plant debris, animals and lebensspuren (evidence of organisms in the sediment) suggest that the abundance level of benthic and benthopelagic organisms is related to the presence of plant material of shallow-water origin.

N2  - All the known North American species of Proctotrupoidea that are parasitic in the eggs of grasshoppers belong to the genera Scelio Latreille and Synoditella, new genus. This paper treats ninteen species of Scelio, of which ten are new, and two species of Synoditella. A new generic name, Sceliocerdo, is proposed for an Indian species, which is discussed because of its similarity to Synoditella. The females of Synoditella and Sceliocerdo attach themselves to female grasshoppers in order that they may be transported to the oviposition sites of their hosts.

N2  - The family Synopiidae (= Tironidae) comprises 69 species in 14 genera, of which 12 new species and 3 new genera are described herein. Keys and diagnoses to the taxa include all described species. The new genera, Ileraustroe, Latacunga, and Priscosyrrhoe, are elaborated from species formerly placed in Austrosyrrhoe or from new species and were suggested by similarity analysis of generic groups arranged in a dendrogram. Three main evolutionary branches occur in the family, comprising groups typified by Synopia-Tiron, Syrrhoe, and Syrrhoites-Bruzelia as based on gnathopodal structure. The shallow-water Synopia-Tiron group has the most advanced gnathopods but retains eyes in most members. The Syrrhoe group, containing shallow and deep-water species, retains eyes in the shallow-water members; but the majority of synopiid species occurs in the anoculate, deep-sea group typified by Syrrhoites and Bruzelia, having ordinary gnathopods.The type-genus, Synopia, is morphologically remote from other genera in the family, formerly known as Tironidae, but in comparison to related families, it remains close to other tironids and should not be segregated at familial level.Synopia and Tiron and possibly Syrrhoe, the only shallow-water tropical genera, are not directly antecedent to the cold-water Syrrhoites group but may be the oldest synopiid genera despite the highly evolved gnathopods in Tiron and pelagont coxae in Synopia and Syrrhoe. Tiron is a benthic genus but Synopia and Syrrhoe are nektodemersal. Most synopiids are adapted to epibenthic life though many feed on the benthos. These adaptations make them very successful in the deep sea but not in the hydrologic turmoil of the shallow sea, where amphipods are usually wholly nektonic or wholly fossorial except during male swarming.

N2  - This paper reports on a three-year study of the behavior and ecology of the Asiatic elephant (Elephas maximus maximus L.) in the Gal Oya and Ruhunu National Park areas of Ceylon. The study area in eastern Ceylon is in a zone which shows a gradation in climate from moist to arid. This gradient is correlated with gradients in the distribution of plant species and of vegetation types.Two populations were studied in detail. The first, in the area around the Gal Oya National Park, contained an estimated 260-300 elephants. A second population, in the area around Lahugala Tank, was estimated to contain about 150 individuals. An analysis of population structure is reported and the behavior patterns involved in locomotion, resting, feeding, drinking and bathing, rubbing, elimination, and thermoregulatory flapping of the ears are described. Movement rates while feeding were measured and mechanisms of visual communication are described, including two threat displays, nine vocalizations, and several nonvocal means of auditory communication.Composition and structure of herd organization, seasonal movements, and variation in home ranges are discussed. Movement patterns of solitary adult and subadult males in relation to food availability and dominance roles are also considered.Elephants make use of the full variety of vegetation types available to them. Food plants of 88 species were identified, the majority being trees and shrubs. Several important food plants were analyzed for caloric density, and chemical analyses of 8 species showed higher percentages of protein for shrubs as opposed to grasses.Recommendations for management of the elephant within the park and the establishment of a buffer zone between the park and areas of intensive cultivation are made.

N2  - Two new western Atlantic species of Lucinidae, Lucina (Pleurolucina) hendersoni, new species, and Parvilucina (Bellucina) rehderi, new species, are described and figured. A new subgenus, Radiolucina (type-species, Phacoides amiantus Dall, 1901), of the genus Parvilucina is proposed. Certain aspects of the shell morphology of several groups of Lucinidae with similar hinge structure are compared. The nature of radial ornamentation in the subgenus Pleurolucina appears to differ significantly from that of Parvilucina or Radiolucina, suggesting the former should be considered distinct from the latter groups. Certain aspects of the shell morphology of Bellucina is demonstrated to be sufficiently distinct from that of species such as Parvilucina amiantus (Dall, 1901) to justify the establishment of a new subgenus, Radiolucina, for the latter. Several additional aspects of lucinid phylogeny are considered.

Three new genera and two new species are described: Parenchelyurus Enchelyurus (type-species: Enchelyurus hepburni Snyder), Omox biporos (monotypic, from the Gulf of Thailand, New Guinea, and Palau Island), and Haptogenys quadripora (monotypic, from the Gulf of Thailand). Distribution maps and illustrations of all the species except those of Omobranchus are provided. A list of all the nominal species of the Omobranchini with their present status and the location of primary type material is included.

The habitats are described and the possible origins of the shrimps discussed. Procaris, which also represents a new superfamily, may be one of the most primitive living members of the Caridea yet discovered. A key to the caridean superfamilies is presented. The Typhlatya (family Atyidae) is the first species of that genus to be collected outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea and the first known from salt water. A key to the species of Typhlatya is included.

Observations are reported on histology, origin, and development of the following larval structures: body wall, coelom and coelomic elements, retractor muscles, digestive tract, buccal organ, lip gland, nervous system, nephridia, larval glands and terminal organ. Functional significance of certain structures, particularly organs associated with the mouth, is considered. Moreover, available information on developmental histology of other sipunculans is reviewed and intra- as well as inter-phyletic comparisons are discussed. An account is given of the general morphology of the larva and a few observations are noted on larval locomotion and feeding behavior in the laboratory.

N2  - Lepechinella, now a member of Dexaminidae, is perhaps the most diverse gammaridean genus confined to the deep sea. All 23 species, including 9 new spiecies, are reviewed. Atylus aberrantis J. L. Barnard is transferred to Lepechinella. Except for inner lobes on the lower lip of the latter genus, Atylus and Lepechinella scarcely differ from each other because of several species with intergrading characters. Lepechinella and Paralepechinella are the only dexaminid genera in the deep sea; Atylus, the sublittoral genus, contains the logical ancestors to Lepechinella. Most species of Lepechinella are probably ooze dwellers or are weakly epibenthic (demersal); many have bizarre ornaments and a few have the rare attribute of spinose bodies.The diversity of Lepechinella is undoubtedly much higher than now understood but collections are sparse and intact specimens difficult to obtain because of their fragility. They offer an excellent focus for studies of speciation in the deep sea because of a higher number of measurable taxonomic characteristics.

N2  - Two species of Polycelis occur in North America, belonging to two different subgenera, P. (Polycelis) coronata (Girard) and P. (Seidlia) sierrensis, new species. They cannot be distinguished by their external appearance but only by the anatomy of their reproductive systems. P. coronata is represented by three subspecies, P. c. coronata with large penis papilla and predominantly secretory bursal duct; P. c. borealis Kenk with moderately developed penis papilla and nonsecretory bursal duct; and P. c. brevipenis Kenk with reduced penis papilla and secretory bursal duct. The anatomical features of the various forms are described and all known distributional records collected. A comparison is made of the anatomy of P. sierrensis with that of a closely related Japanese species, P. auriculata Ijima and Kaburaki.

N2  - The genera and higher taxa of free-living marine nematodes are presented in the form of a taxonomic hierarchy with an alphabetical list of doubtful genera, an alphabetized index to all taxa in the hierarchy, and a list of the literature cited. The hierarchy includes only those orders of the Class Adenophorea whose representatives are predominately marineâ€”namely, Enoplida, Chromadorida, Desmodorida, Desmoscolecida, Monhysterida, and Araeolaimida. Presentation of the classification in the form of a hierarchy is intended to provide the user with a comprehensive overview of taxonomic relationships. The data included with the name of each taxon are: (1) author and date of publication, (2) page number at which the description originally appeared, (3) synonyms and homonyms. In addition, the type-species and synonyms, with author, date, and page number, are listed for each genus. The present authors have adopted largely the opinions of the most recent investigator of each taxon. In some of the more important instances, where the authors have found it necessary to exercise their own judgment or to apply the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the circumstances of these actions are discussed in the "Introduction."

N2  - The following taxa from shallow waters are considered: Amphilochidae: Austropheonoides J. L. Barnard and a new genus, Moolapheonoides; Dexaminidae: Atylus Leach and Syndexamine Chilton; Gammaridae: Elasmopus Costa, Nuuanu J. L. Barnard and a new genus, Cottesloe; Hyalidae: Allorchestes Dana and Hyale Rathke; Leucothoidae: Leucothoe Leach, Leucothoella Schellenberg and Leucothoides Shoemaker; Stenothoidae: Ausatelson J. L. Barnard, Raumahara J. L. Barnard, Stenothoe Dana and two new genera, Chucullba and Wallametopa.New species of Austropheonoides, Moolapheonoides, Ausatelson, and Raumahara confirm their validity as multispecific genera. Rarity of specimens in Australia of the ordinarily common Elasmopus is further explained not only by the diversity of species in the competitive genus Mallacoota J. L. Barnard but in the presence of two species in Cottesloe. The latter genus is closely related to if not antecedent to Nuuanu, a genus composed of incipient interstitial species.In warm-temperate Australia Stenothoe has several sibling species, thus adding to the examples of genera with sibling species described in Part I of this series. Wallametopa may be antecedent to Parametopa of the Mediterranean Sea. Allorchestes is reorganized on a world basis, reduced to 5 species and the others transferred to Hyale. Two new species of Leucothoides are described to boost this genus to 4 species and to separate all Pacific specimens specifically from Atlantic taxa.

N2  - All 34 species previously referred to Cypretta are reviewed, and four of these are removed from the genus because they lack the characteristic anterior septate margins. The morphology of septa along the anterior margins is discussed and illustrated. The life cycle of C. kawatai was observed in the laboratory, where the species proved to be parthenogenetic. Ontogenetic studies showed the following: in dorsal view the outline changes from pointed ends and greatest width at approximate midlength in early stages to a blunter posterior end and greatest width at a distance of approximately one-third from the posterior end in adults; the lateral outline changes from subtriangular in early stages to subovate in adults. The following characters are restricted to adults: septate anterior margins; ventroposterior nodes on the right valve and opposing scalloped structures on the left valve; columns on the anterior margin of both valves that are either superposed on or adjacent to the septa and are present on the ventroposterior margin of the right valve only. A lectotype is designated for Cypretta globulosa (Sharpe, 1910), considered here to be a valid species.

N2  - The branchiobdellid fauna of Mesoamerica consists of sixteen species, assigned to four genera. Of these, all are endemic to the area except the widespread species, Bdellodrilus illuminatus and Pterodrilus mexicanus. The latter is considered to be a doubtful occupant of the region. Of the fourteen remaining species, three are assigned to the genus Sathodrilus, one newly described, and eleven to Cambarincola, ten of which are newly described. The names of thirteen species of the genus Cambarincola are emended to conform to the masculine gender of the generic name. The report of the presence in Mexico of Cambarincola macrodontus and C. philadelphicus (Rioja, 1943) is not accepted. A brief review of the pertinent literature is followed by discussions of methods and sources of materials, some remarks on taxonomic characters relevant to the Mesoamerican branchiobdellids, cross-referenced lists of species of branchiobdellids, their hosts and entocytherid ostracod associates, a short account of the ecology of the worms and an attempt to relate the distribution of Mesoamerican branchiobdellids with that of their hosts and associates. The conclusion is reached that representatives of all the main stocks of branchiobdellids reached southern Mexico in pre-Pliocene times and that there is no completely satisfactory way of differentiating between any subsequent invasions. The treatment of the species include keys, synonomies, bibliographic references, diagnoses, distribution and hosts, with all new species illustrated and fully described.

T1  - The Behavior of Ocellated Antbirds

UR  - http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Zoology/sc_RecordSingle.cfm?filename=SCTZ-0144
N2  - A ten-year study of color-banded Ocellated Antbirds (Phaenostictus mcleannani) on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, showed that they persistently follow army ants for arthropods flushed by the ants. Dominant over the smaller antbirds that follow ants, they take the best zone low over the center of an ant swarm and drop to the ground for prey. They rest and preen for long periods of maintenance behavior each day, probably because as dominant birds they get food easily. Alarm behavior is similar to that of other antbirds. Agonistic behavior contrasts with other antbirds in having a silent challenging display and an unusually wide spectrum of submissive calls and postures. Courtship is mainly courtship feeding and singing; monogamous mates stay together for years.The nest is probably sunk in the ground between tree buttresses. Males incubate in the morning and late afternoon, females in the early afternoon and at night. Males and females feed nestlings and fledglings. Pairs renest repeatedly during the rainy season, April to December, but nest predation is high. Young are feeding themselves a month after appearing at swarms with their parents, but then irregularly stay with their parents up to several months (females) or years (males). Loose patrilineal clans form, in which gene transfer between clans is mainly by movement of young females. Daughters-in-law are tolerated. Clan members sometimes forage together, but use much submissive display. They close ranks or "bunch" in disputes with other pairs or clans. The social system is somewhat like that of chimpanzee groups and perhaps like that of early manâ€”two other dominant animals dependent on local and varying sources of food.The clan system permits complete overlap of home ranges of pairs. The parental pair in an area tends to dominate trespassing pairs and their own offspring. This social system permits great local concentration over good ant swarms. It is facilitated by tolerance for related birds, silent (and thus less disturbing) challenging, and by a wide variety of submissive displays. The Ocellated Antbirds on Barro Colorado concentrated at ant swarms on escarpment zones near the center of the island. Even with these concentrations, however, the species declined to near extirpation between 1960 and 1971.

N2  - The genus Atelopus is represented in Ecuador by 15 species, of which 6 are here described as new taxa. A key for identification, descriptions, and figures are presented for all species, and a detailed analysis of variation in proportions attempts to quantify certain subjective characteristics used by earlier frog systematists.The genus includes two nonphylogenetic groups of species, the first, with slender bodies and long limbs, usually found in the lowlands and lower mountain slopes, and the second, with stocky bodies and short limbs, usually found at higher altitudes in the Andes. The species appear to be highly responsive to environmental changes, and successful invasions of the mountains by the lowland species are accompanied by differentiation, evolution, and speciation. Invasions are likely to be along major river drainages. The invaders are effectively isolated from adjacent drainages by factors such as the highly dissected terrain, rain shadow, barren areas, and so on. High altitude species are restricted in lateral distribution, but often have considerable altitudinal range, while low altitude species have wide latitudinal range, but are restricted altitudinally.The mountains in Ecuador are "continental islands," showing diversity and adaptive radiation similar to that of the Hawaiian Islands, with the major difference that the Andes are not dependent upon "waifs" or "drifters" for invaders, but are constantly supplied by the abundant life of the surrounding tropical forests.

Diagnostic keys are given for the families and genera, and illustrations of significant characters are given for each genus. Several changes are made in the classification of the Hyperiidea. Tribes are changed to infraorders and subtribes to superfamilies, with the necessary nomenclatural changes being made. A new superfamily, Lycaeopsoidea, for the family Lycaeopsidae, and a new family, Anapronoidae, for Anapronoe, are proposed. A new genus, Spinoscina, is proposed for Acanthoscina spinosa; and Vibilioides and Parascelus are reduced to synonyms of Vibilia and Thyropus, respectively.

N2  - The type-material of North American clearwing moths of the family Sesiidae is reviewed by bringing together all the available data for the 255 species group names applied to this fauna area. Of these 255 names, 72 required lectotype designations, 152 were described from single specimens, and the remaining 31 are lacking in sufficient data to determine the number of specimens included in the original type series. The names are arranged alphabetically by specific name preceded by the genus in which it was originally described. The following information sequence is presented for each name: original combination; reference to original description; pertinent comments from the original description concerning the number of specimens, sex, locality, collection, and source of the types; exact label data on types, their present location, and number of syntypes examined; and subsequent pertinent comments and actions.

N2  - Investigations of the seasonal, reproductive, and population ecology of Nephila maculata are reported in detail. In an investigation of feeding ecology over a one-year period, the discarded remains of the prey caught by a sample population of ten adult female spiders were collected daily. These remains were identified (where possible) and the accumulated weekly discards from each spider were dried and weighed. Data from this study are analyzed, tabulated, and compared with the catches from insect traps located in the study area. The study included an investigation of web structure, frequency of web renewal, and the number of kleptoparasites associated with Nephila maculata.Studies of behavior included courtship, mating, predatory behavior, and responses to predators, sunlight, and rainfall. Courtship behavior included a complex pattern of silk deposition by the male on the female, here reported for the first time for the Araneida. The predatory behavior of N. maculata is analyzed in terms of behavior units and behavior sequences and is compared with that of other Nephila species, related species, and that of other araneids studied by the authors.The phenological aspects of the study are stressed and discussed.

N2  - All available literature dealing with the genus Cancellus is reviewed. Of the ten nominal species in the genus, eight are probably valid. Reports made by previous authors on the biology, ecology, and behavior of these specialized hermit crabs are included along with new observations.New material of six nominal species of Cancellus was examined: Cancellus ornatus and C. spongicola from the West Indies are redescribed and illustrated. C. calypso Forest and St. Laurent, 1967, was found to be within the range of variation of C. ornatus and is considered a synonym. Cancellus tanneri from the eastern Pacific is redescribed and illustrated. The morphology of the few specimens available was practically identical to that of C. ornatus, and it appears that the two are closely related. The eastern Atlantic species, C. parfaiti, is redescribed and figured; it seems to be closely related to C. spongicola. Cancellus typus, the Australian species, is redescribed and illustrated. Although distinct, it has several characters in common with C. parfaiti. The holotype of Cancellus canaliculatus (Herbst) from the "east Indies" is redescribed and illustrated. It is generally similar to C. parfaiti, but can be distinguished easily. A specimen of C. investigatoris from Japanese waters is redescribed and illustrated. This species, also known from Indian coasts, is similar to C. parfaiti as noted by Alcock (1905), and is distinct from C. canaliculatus. Cancellus macrothrix, the aberrant species from South Africa, is reviewed. It shows characters which may be more primitive and more typically diogenid than those of the other species. Cancellus viridis, a new species from the Caribbean, is described and figured. Its morphology is much like that of C. ornatus. This species brings the total number in the genus to nine if the aberrant C. macrothrix is included. A key to all described species is given.

N2  - A superfamily Corophioidea is revived to include Corophiidae, Ampithoidae, Ischyroceridae, Podoceridae, Biancolinidae, and Cheluridae. The Podoceridae are presumed ancestors of Caprogammaridae and the suborder Caprellidea. The Photidae, Aoridae, and Isaeidae are abolished and absorbed into the Corophiidae. Axial reversal of dominance in gnathopods 1-2 is now overruled as a fundamental evolutionary feature of familial impact; instead, axial reversal is seen to have occurred several times and possibly itself has been reversed at least once. Dorsoventral flattening of the urosome is also discarded as of no conservative evolutionary content within the old Photidae and Corophiidae. The loss of web spinning glands has occurred at least thrice in the superfamily within the Podoceridae, Cheluridae, and Isaeidae, but in the latter family the loss is unconnected to any other morphological revolution and therefore Isaeidae are synonymized with Corophiidae. Podoceridae, Ampithoidae, and Cheluridae are strictly definable clusters of genera descended from various corophiids, whereas Ischyroceridae are possibly polyphyletic but can be easily recognized and defined. Within the highly diverse Corophiidae at least 16 clusters within the 50 genera are loosely defined. Though few of the clusters can be interconnected by visualizing a few simple morphological changes in evolution, the nomenclatural recognition of these clusters as subfamilies is pointless because of the multifactorial diagnoses and long discussion of exceptional cases necessary for their definition.

N2  - Abundant remains of a medium-sized, flightless rail collected on Ascension Island are described as a new species, Atlantisia elpenor. The very large, extinct, flightless rail, previously described as Aphanocrex podarces, is also shown to be a member of the genus Atlantisia, the only other member of which is the diminutive, flightless, living species A. rogersi of Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha group. These three species are believed to be descended from a common mainland ancestor of a pro-Rallus stock that arrived as wind-blown vagrants to all three islands where each population independently evolved flightlessness and divergent body sizes in response to different environmental conditions. Bones of a flightless rail much smaller than A. podarces were also discovered on St. Helena and represent a new species, Porzana astrictocarpus, which, along with the flightless species "Porzanula" palmeri of Laysan Island in the Pacific, is thought to be descended from the widespread Old World species Porzana pusilla. The two nearly identical flightless gallinules of Tristan da Cunha (nesiotis) and Gough (comeri) Islands are considered as each having been independently derived from volant Gallinula chloropus and are, therefore, best treated as separate species or as subspecies of G. chloropus rather than one being a subspecies of the other. Two species of purple gallinules (Porphyrula) are regular vagrants to the South Atlantic islands yet have never established breeding populations on any of them. This genus is thought to be too specialized morphologically to adapt to insular environments. Flightlessness in rails is shown to be a neotenic condition that involves only the control of relative growth of body parts, is evolved at a rapid rate, and therefore has limited taxonomic significance. The evolutionary advantage of flightlessness is thought to be in the conservation of energy resulting from the decrease in mass of the flight muscles.

N2  - Five species of the genus Solenocera occur in the western Atlantic, one of which is described as new: S. acuminata, new species, S. atlantidis, S. geijskesi, S. necopina, and S. vioscai. A key for their separation, references, disposition of types, locality records, diagnosis, detailed description, and illustrations for each species are presented; variations of several morphological and morphometric characters are assessed; and affinities of each species are indicated. Their geographic distributions and depth-temperature relationships are discussed; the range of S. vioscai was discovered to be limited to North American waters; in contrast, that of S. acuminata, new species, its close relative, to be restricted to the Bahamas, the Caribbean, and the Atlantic coast of northeastern South America. Solenocera necopina is newly reported in the Caribbean and the South Atlantic, off Uruguay, about 11,000 km southward of its previously known limit; S. atlantidis is recorded in the coastal waters of SaÃµ Paulo, which represents an extension of about 7500 km of the range of the species southward, and the range of S. geijskesi was found to extend into the Caribbean as far north as Isla Mujeres, and along the north coast of Brazil to CearÃ¡.

T1  - The Familial Phylogeny of the Tetraodontiformes (Acanthopterygii: Pisces) as Evidenced by Their Comparative Myology

N2  - The myology of 46 species of the order Tetraodontiformes is described, the species representing the 11 families initially recognized for the purposes of this study. The data gathered from the descriptions has been interpreted phylogenetically, using only those characters of a shared specialized (synapomorph) nature. This analysis suggests that the Triacanthodidae and Triacanthidae are sister groups, and separated off first from the ancestral stock. The remaining families are divided into two lines. On the one hand, the Balistidae form the sister group of the Monacanthidae, and together form the sister group of the Aracanidae and Ostraciidae. In the other lineage, the Triodontidae separated off first, followed by the Molidae. The Diodontidae form the sister group of the Tetraodontidae plus Canthigasteridae.In the final analysis, such fossils as are considered pertinent to the understanding of tetraodontiform phylogeny are considered. The information provided by these fossils, combined with the results of the myological interpretations, suggest the following systematic changes in the hierarchical classification of tetraodontiforms in order to bring it into line with the proposed phylogeny: (1) that two suborders be provisionally recognized, the first containing the Triacanthodidae and Triacanthidae, the second consisting of two superfamilies; (2) that a superfamily Balistoidea be recognized to contain the families Balistidae, â€ Spinacanthidae, and Ostraciidae; (3) that the families Monacanthidae and Aracanidae be treated as subfamilies of the Balistidae and Ostraciidae respectively, and that the â€ Spinacanthinae of Tyler (1968) be removed from the Triacanthodidae and placed as the sister group of the Balistidae, with equal rank (as â€ Spinacanthidae); (4) that a superfamily Tetraodontoidea be formed to contain the families â€ Eoplectidae, Triodontidae, Tetraodontidae, Diodontidae, and Molidae, and, should â€ Zignoichthys prove to be further along the gymnodont line than â€ Eoplectus, as hinted by Tyler (1972) and tentatively preferred here, the â€ Zignoichthyidae; (5) that the family Canthigasteridae be reduced to subfamilial rank within the family Tetraodontidae, and that the â€ Eoplectinae of Tyler (1972) be transferred from the Triacanthodidae to the superfamily Tetraodontoidea and raised to familial rank, in keeping with its phylogenetic position.

N2  - Seven papers by various authors on the pelagic distribution of several seabirds in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean based largely on the researches of the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program; 1963-1968. "Introduction," by Patrick J. Gould, introduces these and future papers in this series. He discusses the methods and procedures used by the POBSP in gathering and recording data on observations of seabirds, outlines the areas under surveillance, and provides a general account of the oceanography and marine biology of the areas under discussion as a background to understanding the movements of seabirds in relation to their environment. "Sooty Tern (Sterna fuscata)," by Patrick J. Gould, presents the POBSP's records of this most abundant tropical and subtropical Pacific species. Its distribution at sea depends on erratic food availability, location of breeding islands, breeding schedule, and postbreeding dispersal patterns. "Wedge-tailed Shearwater (Puffinus pacificus)," by Warren B. King, gives data on the distribution of the northern, predominantly white-breasted and the southern, dark-breasted morphs of this species. Subtropical populations migrate extensively, for example between the Hawaiian Islands and the Pacific coast of Middle America; tropical populations are apparently nonmigratory. "Black-footed Albatross (Diomedea nigripes)," by Gerald A. Sanger, discusses the distribution and frequency of sightings on a seasonal basis of this ship-following seabird, both in general terms throughout its range and in detail in certain areas, for example, the CalCOFI study covering an eight year period off California and Baja California. Its winter range overlaps largely with, but lies slightly to the south of, its summer range. "Laysan Albatross (Diomedea immutabilis)," by Gerald A. Sanger, analyzes observations of this species and relates its seasonal distribution and abundance to its oceanographic environment. This species is more abundant in the western and central Pacific, whereas the Black-footed Albatross is more abundant in the central and eastern Pacific. "The Storm Petrels (Hydrobatidae)," by Richard S. Crossin, summarizes the POBSP's data on eighteen species or subspecies of storm petrels based on sightings and collected specimens. Pelagic distribution is related to breeding cycles, location of breeding sites, and marine environment. "Red-tailed Tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda)," by Patrick J. Gould, Warren B. King, and Gerald A. Sanger, discusses seasonal distribution and abundance of this species relative to its breeding cycle. This species disperses widely from its breeding islands, for example, from the Hawaiian Islands to the Pacific coast of Middle America. "Recoveries of Banded Laysan Albatrosses (Diomedea immutabilis) and Black-footed Albatrosses (D. nigripes) in the Pacific Ocean," by Chandler S. Robbins and Dale W. Rice, summarizes the seasonal distribution of pelagic recoveries of 324 banded Laysan Albatrosses and 399 banded Black-footed Albatrosses. Different age groups of each species concentrate in somewhat different areas, and, although range overlap between species is almost complete, each has its own distinctive seasonal distribution pattern.

N2  - Five genera and 10 species of clinid fishes are found in Chile and/or Peru. Of these, three genera and eight species are endemic. The other two genera and species are wide-ranging forms in the eastern Pacific with centers of distribution in the tropics. Of the 30 nominal species-group names available for the clinids of Chile and Peru, 15, including several of the oldest, have no extant type-material. The lack of type-material for some names has resulted in involved nomenclatural problems, three of which we have solved by designating neotypes based on the holotypes of other nominal species (thus creating objective synonyms). Neotypes are designated for Blennius tetranemus Cope, Clinus peruvianus Valenciennes, and Clinus guttulatus Valenciennes. Only one nominal species is unaccounted forâ€”Clinus fernandezianus Guichenot. The description of this species pertains to no known clinid and no clinids are known from the type-locality, Juan Fernandez Islands.A key is presented to the species treated and all species of the endemic genera (Myxodes, Auchenionchus, Calliclinus) are illustrated and described in a common format.We have synonymized the clinid subtribe Calliclinidi Hubbs with the subtribe Cryptotremidi Hubbs. These clinids are distinguished from all others in having some caudal-fin rays branched.

N2  - The subterranean amphipod genus Stygobromus is restricted to North America with the exception of one poorly known species from Siberia. Stygobromus is a member of the Crangonyx group of the family Gammaridae and is closely related to two other North American subterranean generaâ€”Apocrangonyx and Stygonectes. It also has a close affinity with the Holarctic genus Synurella. Species of Stygobromus are widely distributed in cave waters and related ground water habitats throughout the greater part of the cavernous regions of the eastern, middle western, and far western United States.A revised diagnosis of the genus is given, accompanied by a redescription of S. hubbsi Shoemaker from Oregon and the descriptions of 17 new species from the western United States. Of the 18 species recorded from the West, 15 belong to the newly erected hubbsi group. Stygobromus putealis (Holmes) from wells in Wisconsin is also assigned to this evolutionary group. Members of the hubbsi group are closely allied morphologically and are assumed to have been derived from a common ancestor. The western species inhabit a variety of subterranean biotopes, including limestone and lava caves, wells, springs, and one deep lake.

N2  - The subdivisions of the infraorder Astacidea, comprising the lobsters (superfamily Nephropoidea) and crayfishes (superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea) are briefly discussed and their affinities indicated. This is followed by a key to the superfamilies and of the families and genera of the Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. Two families, the Astacidae and Cambaridae, are recognized as constituting the holarctic Astacoidea, and the Parastacidae as the only family of the Parastacoidea, which is confined to the Southern Hemisphere. Synonymies and diagnoses of these taxa and the genera composing them are presented; in addition, the range, number of species, references to summary treatments, and illustrations of a representative of each genus are included.

N2  - The systematics and distribution of eight species of burrowing sponges found on the Bermuda platform are discussed. These sponges excavate limestone substrata to form burrows in which they live, thus participating in processes of erosion and sedimentation. Seven species belong to Cliona (Clionidae): C. caribbaea Carter, C. flavifodina, new species, C. paucispina, new species, C. vermifera Hancock, C. dioryssa (Laubenfels), new combination, C. lampa Laubenfels, and C. amplicavata, new species; one species belongs to Spheciospongia (Spirastrellidae): S. othella Laubenfels. In addition to the three new species, two sponges are new records for Bermuda: C. caribbaea (not sensu Verrill, 1907, and Laubenfels, 1950) and C. vermifera. Among the C. lampa population three phenotypic forms are distinguished: formae lampa, occulta, and flavida. Appearance of live and preserved specimens, internal structure, spicules, and excavations are described in detail to permit field identification by nonspecialists. Scanning electron photomicrographs are used to clarify the fine structure of microscleres.

T1  - The Systematics, Postmarsupial Development, and Ecology of the Deep-Sea Family Neotanaidae (Crustacea: Tanaidacea)

VL  - 170
SP  - 1
EP  - 265
UR  - http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Zoology/sc_RecordSingle.cfm?filename=SCTZ-0170
N2  - The deep-sea family Neotanaidae (Crustacea: Tanaidacea) is revised, its complex life history described for the first time, and its ecology discussed. Ten new species of Neotanais and a single species of each of two new genera, Carololangia and Venusticrus, are described. Nine of the 16 previously described neotanaid species recognized in this study are completely redescribed and illustrated; comments are presented on the other seven species, and new diagnoses are provided for the two previously known genera, Neotanais and Herpotanais. One pair of sibling species, Neotanais americanus and N. sandersi, is recognized. Copulatory (adult) males and females are strongly dimorphic, and the males of one species of Neotanais frequently resemble those of other species much more closely than the females of their own species. Intraspecific geographic variation usually is low among widely separated populations, and these vary in different characters and in various degree. Morphological variation with depth is minimal and usually undetectable. The literature dealing with tanaidacean postmarsupial development is reviewed. The sequence of developmental instars within the genus Neotanais was determined by detailed external morphological and internal gonadal analyses, made possible for the first time by the large numbers of individuals collected by the Hessler-Sanders epibenthic sled. Neotanaid development resembles that of other peracaridan crustacean taxa with the additional complication of protogyny. Two successive manca stages are followed by a juvenile stage which then usually becomes a preparatory male or female. A single preparatory male stage leads to a sexually mature, gonochoristic, primary copulatory male. Two successive preparatory female stages are followed by a potentially brooding copulatory female which can, following a molt, become a fully functional, dimorphic, protogynous, secondary copulatory male. Neotanaids are epifaunal in habit, do not build tubes, and apparently feed on organic detritus on the deep-sea floor. Although the number of neotanaid species is relatively low, several species are known to be very widely distributed; and species diversity at a single location may be considerable, with up to five species of Neotanais having been collected at a single station. The density of neotanaids on the Gay Head-Bermuda Transect, off Massachusetts, varies from 0.75 to 46.7 animals/m2; the presence or absence of variation in density with depth could not be determined. Depth distributions of neotanaids are wide, commonly being greater than 2500 m on the Gay Head-Bermuda Transect. Species collected in Antarctic waters do not support the hypothesis of Antarctic "gigantism" or "overgrowth." Very young stages and females with marsupia have been found throughout the year in some species, indicating that reproduction may be aseasonal and continuously occurring.

N2  - The known species of Central American cheirodontin fishes, characids with a single row of premaxillary teeth, are reviewed. A key to their identification is provided. The review includes members of the genera Cheirodon, Carlana, Phenagoniates, and Saccoderma. All species are described and illustrated except for the Central American form of Saccoderma, which is known to us only from juveniles and may belong to an undescribed species. Two new species of Cheirodon are described: C. dialepturus from the Pacific drainages of west-central and western Panama, from eastern Cocle Province west to the Rio Coto, Costa Rica; and C. mitopterus from the Rio Cocle del Norte Basin, an Atlantic drainage of Central Panama.Rhoadsia eigenmanni is placed in Carlana, the generic name available for the preoccupied Carlia. The genera Odontostilbe, Pseudocheirodon, and Compsura are synonomized with Cheirodon, based on reevaluation of the characters formerly used to define these genera as well as a renewed evaluation of the concept of the genus in characid fishes. Finally, some reasons are presented for considering the Cheirodontinae polyphyletic.

Only 8 percent of about 500 samples collected with a 0.1 m2 Smith-McIntyre grab contained myodocopids. The new species is described herein, and a supplementary description is given of the related Synasterope psitticina (Darby, 1965), which lives off Sapelo Island, Georgia. The distribution and abundance of the Myodocopina of Cape Cod Bay are compared with that in Discovery Bay and English Strait, Antarctica.

N2  - The type-species of Caobangia Giard, C. billeti Giard, is redescribed, primarily in terms of its setal morphology. The description of six new species of Caobangia extends the distribution of the genus from North Vietnam to Thailand, Burma, Ceylon, India, Bangladesh, Java, Sabah, Sarawak, and certain of the Philippine Islands. The genus is associated with gastropod molluscs of the families Thiaridae, Pleuroceridae, and Viviparidae, and with the bivalve family Unionidae. Detailed observations on the external morphology and the anatomy of species of Caobangia, as well as their setal structure and distribution, have contributed to the decision to erect a separate family, the Caobangiidae, for the genus. Familial characters are: the presence of neurosetal palmate hooks on the first setiger; the absence of hooks of any sort on the following thoracic setigers; the presence of two types of avicular hooks in the posterior region; and the recurving of the gut, within the body, such that the anus opens anteriorly, in the region of the second to forth thoracic setiger. Anatomical observations on the branchial crown and its supporting skeleton, the nervous system, the nephridial ducts, and the reproductive system of these hermaphroditic, larviparous, freshwater polychaetes are reported. Further comments are made on larval morphology, settling, and metamorphosis, as well as on the molluscan associates and their habitats, and some basic questions of biological import posed by the morphology, anatomy, and development of Caobangia are propounded.

A new species of lizard (Phyllodactylus), a new starfish (Tamaria), two new species of shrimp (Alpheus and Synalpheus), and a new species of fish (Chriolepis) are described. The terrestrial ecology of Malpelo and the behavior and natural history of the lizards Anolis agassizi and Diploglossus millepunctatus are described and discussed. Genic variability in A. agassizi has been investigated and karyotypes of A. agassizi and D. millepunctatus are reported. The ecology of the island's benthic marine communities is detailed and papers listing and discussing zoogeographically interesting features of the island's crustacean, starfish, and fish species are included. The geology of Malpelo is briefly described and an improved map of the island is presented. The importance of Malpelo Island in the understanding of biogeographic problems in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean is reviewed.

N2  - Omobranchus comprises 19 species, one of which includes two subspecies. Three species are described as new: O. meniscus, from Thailand, O. steinitzi, from the southern Red Sea, and O. verticalis, from Queensland. A key is given to all taxa of Omobranchus, and sexual dimorphism, geographic distribution and variation, habitat, and nomenclature are discussed. All taxa are illustrated and their distributions plotted on maps. Neotypes are designated for the following species: Blennechis fasciolatus Valenciennes (1836), Petroscirtes lineolatus Kner (1868a,b), Petroscirtes ferox Herre (1927).Omobranchus is native to the Indo-west Pacific, and all taxa, except one subspecies, occur only in areas west of the Andesite Line. One species, O. punctatus, has been introduced into the Caribbean. Circumstantial evidence indicates that O. punctatus was probably introduced by ships transporting East Indian coolies from Madras and Calcutta around southern Africa to the Caribbean between 1845 and the opening of the Panama Canal (1914).New information (range extensions, taxonomy, errata), since Springer's 1972 Synopsis of the Tribe Omobranchini, is given for the genera Enchelyurus, Haptogenys, Omox, and Parenchelyurus. Haptogenys quadripora Springer is synonymized with H. bipunctata (Day).

Specimens from seven stations worked by the Te Vega in the Andaman Sea, Indonesia, and western Pacific, and shore collections made at Madagascar and the islands to the north and at Cocos (Keeling) Island in the eastern Indian Ocean are also dealt with.A total of 56 species belonging to 30 genera are reported on. Fifty-two of the species were collected by the Anton Bruun and the 32 species collected at 28 stations in the western Indian Ocean represent just over one-third of the total number of majid spider crabs from that area. The collections were taken mainly on the upper part of the continental shelf, but six species were collected at depths exceeding 200 meters. Basic references, descriptive notes, and a summary of the geographic distribution are given for each species.Achaeus curvirostris (A. Milne Edwards), new combination, and Hyastenus ovatus (Dana) are shown to be senior synonyms of A. fissifrons (Haswell) and Hyastenus tenuicornis Pocock, respectively, and Naxia mamillata Ortmann, a junior synonym of Naxioides robillardi Miers. In addition, Doclea tetraptera Walker is confirmed as a junior synonym of D. calcitrapa White, Eurynome longimana Stimpson of E. aspera (Pennant) and Pseudocollodes complectens Rathbun of Inachus dorsettensis (Pennant). Barnard's "Macropodia formosa var" is identified as M. intermedia Bouvier. These last three species, previously known from the east Atlantic and South Africa, are recorded from east Africa for the first time. Chlorinoides tosaensis Sakai and Majella brevipes Ortmann, previously known from Japan, and Oncinopus neptunus Adams & White (=O. aranea auct. in part) and Simocarcinus obtusirostris Miers from the western Pacific are recorded from the Indian Ocean for the first time. The majority of the species collected are widely distributed Indo-West Pacific ones.

The valid names and synonyms of the species are listed, as well as their distributional areas and their principal morphological, taxonomic, and ecological literature. The genera Planaria and Polycelis, which now are valid genera of freshwater triclads, encompassed originally many species which in the modern taxonomy are placed into other orders and suborders of the Turbellaria and into the Nemertina. These species are listed in the index and referred to their proper taxa.

Four species, philipi, new species, chimbu, new species, yorkensis, new species, and grossus, new species, are newly described and illustrated. The remaining nine species are redescribed and illustrated. Notes are presented on probable phylogenetic relationships with the African genera Thryptocerus, Orthocerodus, and Hoplolenus, and a preliminary zoogeographic scenario is presented, based on these suspected relationships. The Indian genus Holcocoleus is thought to be a possible key to the hypothesized relationships and is in need of further study.

N2  - The Dolichopodidae of the Island of Dominica are surveyed and keys and descriptions are presented for the 30 genera and 113 species. Three genera, Cryptopygiella, Dominicomyia, and Micromedetera, and 69 species from the island are described as new. New species described from other localities include Asyndetus deficiens from Mona Island, A. pogonops from Puerto Rico, Enlinia jamaicensis, E. crassipes, E. farri, Harmstonia acuta, H. jamaicensis, and Micromedetera wirthi from Jamaica, and Cymatopus wirthi, Enlinia crassitibia, E. wirthi, E. panamensis, Harmstonia wirthi, H. panamensis, and Micromedetera shannoni from Panama. Two groups of genera, Enlinia-Harmstonia and Micromedetera, are noted for their particularly small size and elusive habit. It is suggested that these microdolichopods have a different basic biology, perhaps partially abandoning the predaceous habit that is characteristic of most of the family. Special note is taken of members of the predaceous genus Medetera found in proximity to various termite nests on Dominica.

N2  - Based on newly collected material, this study is a supplemental treatment to an earlier review of the South American genus Nannostomus by the senior author. Eleven species are here recognized, N. espei, N. digrammus, N. harrisoni, N. beckfordi, N. bifasciatus, N. minimus, N. marginatus, N. trifasciatus, N. marilynae (new), N. unifasciatus, and N. eques. An artificial key to all these species is included. Additional collections of two species, N. bifasciatus and N. minimus, have allowed a more complete description of the former and recognition of the latter, which had been listed as a synonym of N. beckfordi by Weitzman (1966). One new species, N. marilynae, is described from the Amazon basin. The interrelationships of all the species are reconsidered and because the new material has revealed intermediate conditions in the characters formerly used to separate the nominal genera Nannostomus and Poecilobrycon, the latter is here regarded as a synonym of the former. Relationships among the species are not clear from the population samples currently available for study, but it seems probable that N. espei, in the aggregate of its characters, is the most primitive species in Nannostomus and not closely related to any other species. N. marginatus and N. trifasciatus, undoubtedly closely related to each other, are not particularly close to any other species or species group. The same may be said for the related N. eques and N. unifasciatus in their relation to other species. The remaining species all seem distinct from one another and their possible relationships to other species in the genus remain obscure.Evolutionary trends toward specialization within the genus appear to be development of longitudinal stripes, development of oblique bands, loss of ossification of the sensory canal in the second infraorbital bone, an elongation and thickening of the anal-fin rays of males as an aid to fertilizing eggs, possibly the development of an ocellus in the dorsal lobe of the caudal fin, and development of nuptial tubercles on the ventral surface of the head. Thickening of anal-fin rays occurs to a certain extent in other lebiasinids, but it is carried to an extreme in some species of Nannostomus. Nuptial tubercles occur in another lebiasinid genus, Pyrrhulina, but their high concentration on the ventral surface of the head in N. unifasciatus is a specialization not found in Pyrrhulina.

T1  - Communication in Red Fox Dyads: A Computer Simulation Study

N2  - This paper reports on a computer simulation study of communication that occurs in red fox [Vulpes vulpes (= V. fulva)] dyads with various means of signalling when the animals move about and signal with various emission intensities and at various time intervals.For any two animals, three major factors limit communication: (1) whether appropriate signal mechanisms are available, (2) whether they are motivated to communicate, and (3) whether their movements and locations are such that signals can pass between them. In this study, signal mechanisms and motivation were not considered as variables, but the role of animal movement in limiting communication was.No tactile communication occurred between members of any of the simulated dyads, and close-range visual or vocal communication (from 16 m or less) occurred only rarely. Visual communication occurred frequently with reasonably short visual ranges (20 percent of the time from 306 m), and is probably usually limited by darkness and terrain. Vocal signals that could be heard from 644 meters gave communication 20 percent of the time when the signaller vocalized 4.7 times per hour. Wild red fox seldom emit loud vocalizations, however, and vocal communication is probably not of prime importance in maintaining dyadic social bonds. Communication occurred 20 percent of the time with scent point signalling (scent marking), when scent remained effective for 8 hours or longer, when scent could be smelled 96 m from the scent mark, and when the signaller marked twice per hour. Thus, high levels of dyadic communication may be achieved through scent marking, and this form of signalling may be of great importance in maintaining dyadic spacing and social bonding.The particular movement patterns of the animals that formed each dyad had a differential effect on the level of communication, regardless of the means of signalling. Those means of signalling that involved the fewest communication variables were most severely limited by movements of the animals. Where more variables associated with emission of signal were available to the animal, emission could be optimized to minimize effects of movement on communication.This study suggests that the animals can adjust the distance between them, the time between them, or both, if prior communication has given mutual awareness of the locations and movement patterns. In these adjustments, they can increase or decrease the efficiency of signalling in one or more ways, and thus control the level of dyadic communication.

Comparisons are made between the molluscan faunas of St. Helena and Ascension, overall findings showing that species of both islands are derived in similar proportions from the various other world faunal areas. Species endemicity is many times greater on St. Helena than on Ascension, probably due in part to the considerably greater geological age of the former island.

N2  - Thirty-seven characters of external morphology, myology, osteology, life history, and chromosome morphology are studied. For each character, the evolutionary directions of changes of states are inferred. This information is used to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis of the intergeneric relationships of the New World frog family Leptodactylidae. Five major groupings of leptodactylids are proposed: the telmatobines, ceratophrines, leptodactylines, grypiscines, and eleutherodactylines. Formal recognition of these groupings is delayed until more information becomes available which will likely modify the intra- and intergroup relationships. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the five groups are robust units, however.Recognition of the five groups allows a reinterpretation of the historical zoogeography of the family. The family Leptodactylidae had its origins in the temperate beech forests of South America. The telmatobines represent a remnant of the original leptodactylid stock, which has remained in the beech forests. Two groups became adapted to drying conditions, the ceratophrines and leptodactylines. The grypiscines represent a forest-stream adaptational complex that centered in southeastern Brazil. The eleutherodactylines were probably derived from a grypiscine ancestor. Early attainment of direct development in the eleutherodactylines was a preadaptation which resulted in an explosive radiation of the Eleutherodactylus-complex, which is now represented by about 350 species which occupy diverse environmental situations.A leptodactylid-liopelmatid relationship is suggested, which has the advantages of an in situ evolution of the leptodactylids rather than a migration from North Temperate regions as previously proposed. An alternate leptodactylid-discoglossid relationship argument which was based in large part on tadpole evidence is countered by a consideration of the major functional adaptations of tadpoles.

Data on meristic characters and their variation are reported for many populations of M. triangulatus. The species is highly variable but shifts in means for various meristic characters tend to follow a geographic pattern; however, several of the means for the Trinidad and Venezuela populations stand out from those of nearby populations. A key is given to the Atlantic species of Malacoctenus, following Springer (1958), but employing additional characters.

N2  - The tropical bug Antiteuchus tripterus and two parasites of its eggs, Trissolcus bodkini and Phanuropsis semiflaviventris, were studied in urban Cali, Colombia. Female bugs guard both their eggs and first instar nymphs. Behavioral observations, combined with analyses of the patterns of parasitism within egg masses of a given form, showed that the details of the bug's defensive behavior and the wasps' attacks strongly influence the survival rates of eggs in different positions in an egg mass.By removing guarding female bugs from their eggs, it was shown that the net effect of their defense against generalized egg predators is to greatly improve egg survival but that, paradoxically, the net effect against the parasitic wasps is to decrease survival. Although the bugs repel wasps that have found egg masses, the bug's presence over the mass betrays the location of the eggs to hunting wasps. A hypothetical evolutionary history suggests that as the bugs improved their protection of eggs, they produced thinner egg shells, and that they are now trapped into continuing their defense in spite of subsequent advances by the wasps in their hunting behavior. Experimental removal of bugs guarding first instar nymphs and calculations of the cost of guarding in terms of egg production showed that the net effect of this guarding behavior is positive.Female P. semiflaviventris tend to stay and hunt in the tree where they emerge, while T. bodkini females tend to disperse. Parasitism rates by P. semiflaviventris are strongly influenced by the species of tree where the bug eggs are laid, and both species are influenced by the site of the egg mass (leaf, branch, sucker), but in different ways. Both species also wait near bugs about to oviposit and attack eggs as they are laid, apparently recognizing gravid bugs visually. Parasitism rates of eggs on naturally and experimentally isolated leaves showed that search behavior is accomplished in flight.Natural selection with respect to oviposition site varies greatly with tree species and the site on a given tree. The balance of selection was evidently different where the bugs evolved than in present-day Cali. where they commonly act against their own best interests.Both wasp species agree in general with the behavior pattern for Scelionidae, but differ in several characteristics associated with oviposition. P. semiflaviventris is consistently farther from the family norm than is T. bodkini. The two species of wasp compete at two stages in their life cycle, with neither species consistently dominating. The males fight and exclude each other from egg masses where females will emerge, and multiple ovipositions into single bug eggs produce only single wasps. Both types of competition occur commonly in urban Cali.Many other aspects of the natural history and ecology of the bugs and wasps are presented.

N2  - Twenty species were found living off Carrie Bow Cay. Echinometra lucunter (Linnaeus), E. viridis Agassiz, and Diadema antillarum Philippi are the most common species on the reef. In the lagoon, the most common in the Thalassia beds are Lytechinus variegatus (Lamarck), Eucidaris tribuloides (Lamarck), and Clypeaster rosaceus (Linnaeus). The deeper mud fields have large numbers of the spatangoids Paraster doederleini Chesher, fewer Moira atropos (Lamarck), and Brissopsis elongata Mortensen. Meoma ventricosa (Lamarck) occurs in sand fields both in the lagoon and on the reef. Cassidulus cariboearum Lamarck lives in the lagoon's coarse sand in water one meter deep. This species has never been seen alive in situ before. Immature specimens were found of Plagiobrissus grandis (Gmelin) and Meoma ventricosa (Lamarck). These are the smallest specimens ever described of these species. Their growth changes are described. Rod-like structures are reported in P. grandis, which probably serve to strengthen its very thin test.

N2  - This study is concerned with the comparative anatomy of the external nasal passages and associated structures in delphinid odontocetes. It has been possible to assemble detailed antomical information for nearly all of the delphinid genera. Comparative data for the other small toothed whales is considered in such detail as is available.The function of the structures associated with the external nasal passages has been poorly understood, partly due to a lack of understanding of their anatomy. I have drawn functional conclusions from the basis of this comparative study, but these are largely unsupported by experimental data.The nasal musculature is concerned both with opening and closing the nasal passage during respiration, and with movement of air between the nasal diverticula during sound production. The nasal diverticula are part of the acoustic system of these animals, and function both as air reservoirs and as reflective elements to focus the emitted sound field. The potential area of sound production is limited to the deep structures around the external body nares. The melon probably serves as an acoustic channel. Cranial asymmetry in odontocetes is related to specialized sound-producing mechanisms involving predominantly the right nasal passage.The nasal structures have formed a very important functional complex in the evolution of odontocetes, and are important from a phyletic viewpoint. This study has shown that the genera Tursiops, Stenella, and Delphinus form a relatively generalized group within the Delphinidae. The bulbous-headed genera Grampus, Globicephala, and Pseudorca clearly represent independent specializations. The other families of odontocetes differ considerably from the delphinids in their facial anatomy.The anatomical diversity in this region suggests an acoustic diversity which remains to be demonstrated experimentally.

N2  - The vertical distributions of pelagic cephalopods are analyzed, based primarily on studies undertaken in the waters off California, Bermuda, and Hawaii. Much of the information is derived from midwater trawl nets equipped with closing apparatus. Each family that contains pelagic or quasipelagic species is discussed; selected records from the literature are included where necessary.A wide variety of patterns of vertical distribution exists among pelagic cephalopods; patterns may be associated with stage of maturity, diel rhythms, or seasonal behavior. The study revealed that several basic types of vertical distributional patterns occur: near-surface dwellers, first order diel vertical migrators, second order diel vertical migrators, diel vertical shifters, diel vertical spreaders, nonmigrators, vertical wanderers, species associated with the ocean bottom, species exhibiting ontogenetic descent.

N2  - A simple species list of birds contains within itself environmental information which is analogous to that obtained from a weather station. In both instances the numerical data do not become meaningful until used comparatively.The Class Aves is divisible into passerines, comprising two-thirds of the world's land birds, and nonpasserines, comprising the remaining third. The passerines in turn are divisible into oscines and suboscines. The suboscines are numerous only in the Neotropical region, where they outnumber the oscines. Utilization of these major taxonomic components as though they were ecological assemblages is substantiated on objective grounds for the mainland but is not justifiable for islands.In the neotropics, the relative proportions of the major taxonomic components correlate with the major climatovegetational parameters of rainfall and temperature to provide a comparative measure of faunal and environmental similarity or dissimilarity and of biotic complexity. The suboscine proportion is highest in the rain-forested Amazonian lowlands, thence decreases radially and altitudinally. The oscine proportion fluctuates to varying degree in the opposite direction from that of the suboscine proportion. The nonpasserine proportion decreases with increasing elevation to tree line and with increasing rainfall altitudinally and latitudinally.Crossplotted, the passerine-nonpasserine and suboscine-oscine relationships produce a two-dimensional "map" on which to visualize the comparative distribution of neotropical avifaunas. Avifaunas having similar proportions of passerines (or nonpasserines) and of suboscines (or oscines) form into discrete climatic clusters. Any faunal level can be accommodated from the zoogeographic region down to the habitats at a study site, provided the comparisons are restricted to units of similar size.The smaller the size of the unit, the more precise is the avifaunal or environmental information it furnishes. Whether for purposes of comparison or prediction, equivalent samples from equivalent points at equivalent times of year are not only necessary but also feasible to obtain, and a simple methodology by which to accomplish this is presented. The proposition that site-oriented comparisons in which the loci each approach a bioclimatic standard are fundamental to the choice, study, and preservation of representative natural areas is supported on theoretical grounds and by examples.

N2  - The study describes the mechanisms of communication employed by the individuals of a captive colony of Ateles fusciceps robustus studied by the author for some ten years. The signal system is compared and contrasted with that of a free-ranging group of A. geoffroyi panamensis. The signal systems are discussed within the functional contexts in which they occur. Sexual, grooming, and grappling behaviors are given special quantitative treatment. Auditory signals are considered from the standpoint of syntactic description. A rigorous analysis of the vocalizations is presented together with a contextual description leading to a functional classification. The motivational basis for vocalizations is then explored. The development of vocalizations in the young Ateles is described together with the effects of auditory isolation on vocal development. The vocal repertoire of Ateles is compared with that of Lagothrix, the woolly monkey, and Alouatta, the howler monkey. Preliminary ethograms for Alouatta and Lagothrix are presented in the appendices. It is concluded that the vocal repertoire of Ateles can develop without imitative learning and that the signal system of Ateles shares homologous elements with that of Alouatta and Lagothrix. The degree of similarity is highest between Ateles and the woolly monkey.

N2  - Aspects of the osteology, cranial nerves 5, 7, 9 and 10, lateral-line canals, free lateralis organs and miscellaneous anatomical features of Pholidichthys leucotaenia (the only species in the Pholidichthyidae) are described and illustrated.Pholidichthys is known only from the western Pacific Ocean, from the Philippines east to the Solomon Islands. It has an eellike body form and undergoes striking ontogenetic changes in color pattern. Anatomically the species is most notable for having an autogenous, unpaired ossification of the interorbital septum (which is not a modified orbitosphenoid); no ascending process on the parasphenoid; a large complex metapterygoid; fused 5th ceratobranchials (at sizes at least as small as 16.9 mm); a sagittal sulcus with the ostium completely separated from the cauda by a raised area; an incomplete, disjunct ring of infraorbital bones and interrupted infraorbital sensory canal; no scales; no spines in the vertical fins; apparent displacement dorsally and freeing of the lateralis organs (innervated by the ramus buccalis facialis) of the infraorbital canal in the gap area and partial invasion of the gap by free lateralis organs innervated by the ramus buccalis accessorius facialis of the truncus hyomandibularis; presence of free lateralis organs along the horizontal septum anteriorly ventral to the dorsal collector lateral-line nerve; Serranus pattern (pattern 9) of the recurrent facial nerve; return of the dorsal collector lateral-line nerve to the horizontal septum at a point above, or near, the anus; only two dorsal collector rami joining the dorsal longitudinal lateral-line nerve; an extremely heavy innervation of the conjunctiva of the eye; a single nostril on each side.Based on its pattern 9 recurrent facial nerve, Pholidichthys is a perciform fish and within that grade is highly specialized. With the possible exception of two specializations concerning the dorsal longitudinal lateral-line nerve (point of return to the horizontal septum; number of collector rami), which Pholidichthys shares only with the tropical blennioids, there is no unequivocal conclusion that can be drawn about its subordinal relationships. The osteological evidence does not indicate a close relationship with the tropical blennioids.

N2  - Further studies of the subject of Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, number 149, have filled in gaps in that study and are reported herein. Analysis of data on the web-site constancy of Nephila maculata shows that this spider may, as an adult, spend considerable periods at one site. It almost invariably moves after egg-laying, possibly as an antipredator device. The spider may also move its web site when catching above-average quantities of prey. Such apparently purposeless moves reduce the numbers of theridiid kleptoparasites associated with the Nephila web and this may be their functional significance. It is here reported that N. maculata builds stabilimenta into its molting webs (that lack a viscid element). The egg cocoons of the species are described, numbers and weights of eggs are given, and it is suggested that the structure of araneid egg cocoons may be a useful character for eucidating relationships within the family. Instances of mammalian predation of araneid eggs are described and a full account is given of size and color changes in the developmental history of N. maculata. Males of this spider need only 7 molts to reach maturity whereas females need 13. Mature males and females from the same batch of eggs probably do not overlap in time. Details of the association between a moth and Nephila webs are reported and the relationship is discussed; the moth probably gains protection from association with an aversive structure. Observations show that birds may learn to avoid contact with large araneid webs.New observations on courtship and thermoregulatory behavior are detailed. Courtship includes a preliminary approach stage in which males may react aggressively and displace one another. Copulation times may be much longer than previously reported. The thermoregulatory repertoire of N. maculata is at least as large as that of the other Nephila species studied so far.Adult female N. maculata are used as food in several parts of New Guinea. Methods of cooking and the general flavor are described.

N2  - A study of the ontogeny of the Thaumatocyprididae revealed that most species in the family have six juvenile growth stages. Each growth stage is described and illustrated. A table is presented for the identification of growth stages by using the number of claws on the caudal furca. Keys are presented for the identification of growth stages of Thaumatoconcha radiata and, also, for the identification of genera and species of the Thaumatocyprididae.A phylogeny is derived for the higher taxa of Ostracoda using the Hennigian system. In this phylogeny the suborders Cladocopina and Halocypridina are referred to a new order Halocyprida.The following new taxa are described and illustrated: Thaumatomma piscifrons, new genus, new species, from the Permian of Idhra, Greece, Danielopolina carolynae, new genus, new species, from the South Atlantic Ocean, and Thaumatoconcha radiata, new genus, new species, T. caraionae, new species, T. elongata, new species, T. hessleri, new species, T. polythrix, new species, T. punctata, new species, T. sandersi, new species, T. tuberculata, new species, and Thaumatoconcha species A, from the North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and South Pacific Oceans, and from within the Antarctic Convergence. All species are referred to the ostracode family Thaumatocyprididae (superorder Myodocopa). Supplementary descriptions and illustrations are presented of all previously described living and fossil genera and species of Thaumatocyprididae and some genera and species of the Paleozoic superfamily Entomoconchacea.It is hypothesized that during the Jurassic period, representatives of the Thaumatocyprididae lived on the continental shelves of what is now Europe; then, after the Jurassic, the group migrated down the continental slope in response to competitive pressures. Their descendants survive today in bathyal and abyssal depths of the world's oceans and, in one instance, in a marine cave in Cuba.

N2  - A total of 180 species are listed from both coasts of Panama. The material includes specimens collected by the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and specimens previously reported by Monro and Hartman in a series of papers. Newly described species are Aphrodita diplops, Eupanthalis perlae, Eunereis paitillae, Neanthes galetae, Neanthes pseudonoodti, Nereis panamensis, Marphysa amadae, Isolda bipinnata, and Euthelepus pascua. The eastern Pacific Ocean appears to be more species-rich than the western Atlantic, and relatively fewer species appear widespread in the Pacific than in the Atlantic Ocean. This fact may be because most of the sampling has been done on hard substrates in the Atlantic, while more diverse areas have been sampled in the Pacific. Generally, hard-substrate polychaetes are more widely dispersed than soft-bottom forms.

N2  - Planktonic Ostracoda from depths of surface to 1170 m collected aboard the Research Vessels Trident, Albatross IV, and USNS Sands during 1967 to 1970 on Ocean Acre Cruises 1, 7, 9, and 10 are studied with main emphasis on Cypridinacea and on Cruise 10. The data suggest that the cypridinid species Macrocypridina castanea and the Halocyprididae migrate upward nightly. The collections indicate that M. castanea is primarily an inhabitant of the bathypelagic zone, and that G. muelleri is primarily an inhabitant of the bathypelagic and upper abyssalpelagic zones. Halocyprids were collected at all depths but occurred in the greatest frequency in the epipelagic zone. The reported upper temperatures range of G. muelleri is increased by 10Â°, to 14.9Â°C by the distribution of the species in samples from Cruise 10. The stomach contents of M. castanea indicate that the species is a predator. Ovigerous females of M. castanea have previously been reported from collections made during May and July; the present cruises show that ovigerous females also are present during June, early September, late October, and early November. Reproduction may be less during winter months.The phenomenon of the swallowing of the bristles of the Ist antenna by specimens of M. castanea is studied, and it is suggested that this may take place during the throes of being captured or killed. Swallowing of bristles of the 2nd antenna by this species is reported for the first time. SEM studies of M. castanea and G. muelleri reveal that both species bear lateral glandular fields on the upper lips in addition to previously reported anteroventral fields, and that the comb teeth of the 7th limbs bear terminal pores. The shells of both species have pores and are laminated. The copulatory organ of the adult male M. castanea has pores in the clawlike spine of the anterior proximal lobe and at the tip of the 2nd joint of the posterior, distal lobe.

N2  - The form and gross relations of the dugong's skeletal muscles are described, illustrated, and compared with published descriptions of manatee muscles. Maps of muscle attachments to the bones and data on skin thickness are included.Though closely paralleling cetaceans in swimming adaptations, sirenians are much less specialized in this regard, since they are not active predators. Manatees show less anatomical specialization and presumably less efficiency and endurance in swimming than dugongs because manatees are less active and inhabit more protected waters. The structure of the shoulder region is quite different in the two sirenian families and may reflect the requirements of maneuvering in more or less open habitat. Other muscle systems, however, are not notably different in the two families.

N2  - New World Genus Perilypus is redefined, and its natural history summarized. Species occur in at least three macrohabitats defined as oak, liana, and herbaceous assemblages. Beetles with rectangular bodies inhabit oak and liana assemblages whereas oval-bodied beetles are found among herbaceous plants; mimetic interactions are thought to be the basis for these habitat-body form correlations. Perilypus mimics are regarded as generalists having evolved in appearance and/or behavior characteristics that simulate more than one distasteful model. Altitudinally the genus ranges from sea level to 3400 meters; however, most specimens were collected between 1000 and 2000 meters. Laboratory observations indicate that Perilypus beetles are highly predatory, with size and rigidity of victims being important limiting factors in prey acceptability. The criteria used for recognition of species and of infra- and suprageneric groupings are discussed and techniques for dissections, illustrations, and measurements are described, a morphological analysis of the major external and internal organs is presented, and a key to the species groups and species based on adult characteristics is provided. Larval and pupal stages of Perilypus are described for the first time. The species groups are characterized, and given for each species are, as appropriate, synonymic list, diagnostic combination, description, discussion of structural and chromatic variation, discussion of natural history, geographic distribution, etymological derivation, locality records, general notes, and illustrations. Distribution maps with symbols visually convey the geographic range of species and species groups.There are 49 species presently recognized in Perilypus and 30 of these are described for the first time. Twelve new synonymies are established. A phylogeny of Perilypus is postulated using the Hennigian method of phylogenetic analysis. The zoogeography of the genus is discussed in terms of faunal limits and vicariance. Concepts of historical zoogeography ("faunal tracks", "center of origin and dispersal", and "forest refugia") are briefly discussed and two of them are used to explain distributions of extant Perilypus taxa. Relationship discussions within the species groups vary in completeness according to availability of data. A fairly complete treatise is presented for the larger limbatus, quadrilineatus, and ornaticollis groups, but the treatment of the reventazon group, the largest group in the genus, is very fragmentary. Ancestral Perilypus probably evolved in northern Central America, during mid-Tertiary, and ultimately evolved into eight species groups. Progenitors of the frontalis, criocerides, chaletoides, and quadrilineatus groups remained in northern Central America as did all of their descendants. Ancestors of the limbatus and viridipennis groups dispersed to southern Central America; some members of both groups ultimately penetrated South America. The ornaticollis group, the most derived species group in the genus, and the reventazon group are especially widespread geographically.

N2  - Three new species of freshwater Palaemonetes from Texas and Mexico are described. A key to the known North American species is given along with major taxonomic references on each species since the 1952 revision by Holthuis. The subgenus Alaocaris Holthuis, 1949, is synonymized with the subgenus Palaemonetes Holthuis, 1949. As a result of larval studies, it is concluded that the freshwater species of Palaemonetes in at least North America are of monophyletic origin separate from the marine species. These larval studies also support a close relationship to at least one European and one Asian species. Laboratory studies on the freshwater Palaemonetes kadiakensis Rathbun indicate an inability of this species to disperse across wide oceanic stretches. Origin and dispersal of the freshwater Palaemonetes is considered. Zoogeographical distribution of the genus Macrobrachium Bate and its ecological relationship to Palaemonetes as correlated with geological data support a much earlier origin of the genus Palaemonetes than previously recorded in the literature. Several hypotheses are reviewed in an effort to explain the worldwide distribution of freshwater Palaemonetes. The distributional patterns of Palaemonetes and Macrobrachium appear consistent with the theory of continental drift.

These species are reviewed and revised herein, based in large part on a reexamination of the original material. A single species is referred to Euarche Ehlers, as a new combination in the Polyodontidae (= Acoetidae). The other species are retained in the Polynoidae and placed in seven subfamilies, five of which are new (Macellicephaloidinae, Macelloidinae, Bathyedithinae, Polaruschakovinae, Bathymacellinae) and the other two emended (Macellicephalinae, Harmothoinae). Of the 17 genera involved, three are emended (Macellicephala, Macellicephaloides, Macelloides), ten are new (Bathykermadeca, Bathyeliasona, Bathyvitiazia, Bathyfauvelia, Bathycatalina, Bathykurila, Bathyedithia, Polaruschakov, Bathylevensteina, Gesiella), one is given a new name (Bathymacella, for Macella Averincev); two are considered to be doubtful (Herdmanella Darboux, Sinantenna Hartmann-SchrÃ¶der), and a synonym is referred to Austrolaenilla BergstrÃ¶m. Of the 36 polynoid species, 17 are revised, 13 as new combinations, three as synonyms and one as a new species (Polaruschkov reyssi); seven species are considered to be doubtful.

N2  - Forty-two characters of external morphology, myology, osteology, and life history are studied. For each character, the evolutionary directions of changes of states are inferred. This information is used to construct a phylogenetic hypothesis of the intergeneric relationships of the primarily Australian frog family Myobatrachidae. Three major groupings of myobatrachids are proposed; these are accorded subfamilial status. One of the subfamilies is defined as new. In addition, three genera are proposed as new.It is proposed that the ancestral myobatrachid stock was associated with the Antarcto-Tertiary Geoflora. Several genera still demonstrate a distribution associated with this beech-podocarp vegetation. Major evolutionary events in the family have been associated with stream adaptations, trends toward and including direct development and fossorial adaptations. Convergence in these events with the leptodactylid frog fauna of southern South America is commented upon.

N2  - The genus Alabes, monotypic representative of the Cheilobranchidae, shares a large number of specializations with the members of the Gobiesocidae, including one not known to occur in any other fishes: the supracleithrum bears a shallow, concave process at its distal end that articulates with a convex condyle on the anterior surface of the cleithrum. A vestigial, papillae-bearing "sucking disc" occurs in some specimens of Alabes dorsalis. On the basis of shared specializations, we consider the Cheilobranchidae to be highly specialized gobiesocids. The osteologies of Alabes dorsalis and the gobiesocid Trachelochismus pinnulatus are illustrated. Four species are recognized in Alabes: dorsalis (widespread in southern Australia and Tasmania), parvulus (widespread in southern Australia, Tasmania, and Norfolk Island), brevis (new species from Western Australia), and hoesei (new species from New South Wales, South Australia, and Tasmania).

N2  - A very large amount of new information on cowbird parasitism, based on about 4750 instances reviewed since the senior author's 1971 addendum to his 1963 host catalog, is here brought together. The data are presented in terms of the individual host species for each of the three species of parasitic cowbirds. In some cases, especially of seldom used, or at least seldom reported, hosts, the additional records supplement, but do not alter, our understanding of the host-parasite relation; in some other cases the new data are of sufficient magnitude to support convincingly a change of status. Also, in the case of some of the North American host species, experimental studies of their reactions (as accepters or rejecters) to the eggs of the parasites cause alteration from earlier estimates based solely on empirical field observational data and help to define the nature of the host-parasite relationship more adequately and in a more meaningful way. Parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) is recorded for 26 species and subspecies of birds not hitherto known to be victimized. In the case of the Neotropical shiny cowbird (M. bonariensis) 32 new hosts are documented; for the bronzed cowbird (M. aeneus) 7 new hosts are documented. In all, documentation, with such clarification as the new data permit, is given for 235 species of hosts: 140 hosts of M. ater, 74 of M. bonariensis, and 21 of M. aeneus. In each of these the new information is correlated with that presented in earlier papers, so as to make the total current knowledge available to investigators studying any one of these many species of birds in whose life histories the parasites may play a major or even a very minor role.

N2  - Collections of porcellanid crabs were made in over 130 areas in the Republic of Panama in order to sample as completely as possible all the major marine, estuarine, and freshwater biotopes on both coasts of the isthmus. Additional collections were carried out on Uva Island in the Gulf of Chiriqui, the Perlas Islands in the Bay of Panama on the Pacific coast, and at Galeta Island on the Atlantic coast. Red mangrove Rhizophora mangle, rocky intertidal, pocilloporid coral Pocillopora damicornis, and the coralline back reef biotopes were extensively sampled, as well as selected areas in Miraflores, Pedro Miguel, and Gatun locks in the Panama Canal itself. As a result of the present study, 65 species of porcelain crabs are now known to occur in the tropical waters on either side of the Panamanian isthmus, 43 in the eastern Pacific and 22 in the Caribbean Sea. Included in these are seven species newly recorded for Panama and three recently described species. The porcellanid faunal component in Panama comprises 66% of the total tropical porcellanid component in the Panamic, and 67% of the Caribbean and Antillean faunal subprovinces. A key is provided to aid in identification of the porcellanid crabs that are known, or that are expected to occur in the waters on either side of the isthmus.

N2  - The genus Cynoglossus Hamilton-Buchanan is characterized, and its relationship with other cynoglossid genera is discussed. Forty-nine species including a new species, C. lachneri, are recognized.The origin, distribution, and evolution of the genus are discussed. The genus is of tropical Indo-Pacific and eastern tropical Atlantic in distribution, and the members are mostly marine sandy or muddy shallow-water inhabitants. From the present-day distributional pattern, the genus is considered to have evolved in the Indo-Malayan Archipelago during the Pliocene, and the geological evidences providing explanation for its dispersal to the eastern tropical Atlantic, presumably, during the upper Pliocene have been reviewed.The genus is composed of an extremely homogeneous assemblage of highly specialized species. Based on a comparative study of the epicranial bony system in different families of flatfishes, it is concluded that in the genus Cynoglossus, it is modified to suit a burrowing habit.The apparently primitive and specialized characters in the genus are also outlined. The possession of a lateral line on the blind side is considered a primitive character, for it serves no purpose to a fish adapted for a burrowing mode of life. Thus, the absence of a lateral line on the blind side, reduction in the number of caudal fin rays, reduced size of scales, contiguous or closely set eyes with narrow interorbital space, or reduced or minute eyes with wide interorbital space, and loss of posterior slitlike nasal opening are considered specialized characters necessary for a burrowing habit. Based on the morphological features and on zoogeography, the 49 species have been divided into six groups and 17 complexes, and their hypothetical evolutionary relationships are traced.A key for the separation of species is provided; separate keys for the groups and complexes are not provided, however, since they were mainly based on the pattern of distribution and hence arbitrary in nature. Under each species, the complete synonymy, description, coloration in preservation, size diagnosis and affinities, note on synonymy, information on the type and other material examined, and geographical distribution are given. Lectotypes (wherever necessary) have been selected. Lectotype selection has also been made (wherever necessary), even to a nominal species now considered as a junior synonym to avoid any confusion in the future as to its true identity. The species are illustrated in 40 outline drawings and 21 plates. Eight distributional maps are also provided.

N2  - The study describes and analyzes the behavior of the large-spotted genet (Genetta tigrina) in captivity, and treats selected aspects of behavior in eight viverrid genera occupying five different subfamilies. The natural history of the genus Genetta is reviewed, and the relationships of the living members of various subfamilies are discussed. The behavior of solitary animals is treated by considering locomotion, stances, and object- and self-oriented contact patterns. Scent-marking with glandular products, urine, and feces is considered with reference to the communicative properties of the marking behavior and the substance. Sonographic and contextual analyses are used to classify vocalizations and serve to establish homologies between the calls of several species. Further analyses of social behavior in Genetta and Civettictis are based on encounters within all possible pairs of animals. A small number of behavior patterns predominates during most interactions between animals of both species. The primary differences in the communication systems of these two species are probably related to semi-arboreal as opposed to terrestrial habits.

N2  - Habitat partitioning by larval amphibians was studied in two environments. A two-year study was undertaken at the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies and a comparative dry and wet season study was completed at Barro Colorado Island, Panama.At the Chesapeake site, partial year to year differences in temporal larval habitat partitioning combined with different year to year population sizes indicate: (1) different habitat utilization from one year to the next by the larvae, and (2) different biological interactions involving predator-prey and species associations from year to year.The stream bed pond habitat on Barro Colorado Island is effectively partitioned by the tadpole community on the basis of space and time. Predation is an organizing factor in the composition of the tadpole community, interspecific competition apparently is not.This study concludes that competition among tadpoles does not normally occur in nature. Bursts of primary productivity provide superabundant food resources. The habitat partitioning found in tadpole communities reflects the temporal and microhabitat differences associated with the evolutionary life history of each of the species occurring in any pond. Tadpole communities are additive collections of different species, not integrated, interactive superorganizations.

N2  - Eight families comprising 18 genera and 55 species and subspecies of troglobitic and anchialine decapod crustaceans are recorded from the Americas. The family Atyidae is represented by two genera: Palaemonias, with two species occurring in the United States, and Typhlatya, encompassing seven species found in the West Indies, YucatÃ¡n, and the Galapagos Islands. Among the six genera of the family Palaemonidae are the Mexican monotypic Bithynops in Chiapas, Creaseria in YucatÃ¡n, and Neopalaemon in Oaxaca; in addition, one species of the genus Macrobrachium occurs in Oaxaca, two species of the genus Palaemonetes frequent subterranean habitats in the United States, and six members of the genus Troglocubanus occur in Cuba, Jamaica, and San Luis PotosÃ­, Mexico. Only one troglobitic species of the genus Alpheopsis, a member of the largely marine family Alpheidae, occurs in the area, that in Oaxaca, Mexico. Two genera of the also primarily marine family Hippolytidae, Barbouria and Calliasmata, are each represented by a single species occurring in anchialine habitats in the West Indies, the latter only in the Dominican Republic. Of the three endemic American groups, the Cambarinae comprises the largest number of troglobites: there are eight species of Cambarus, six species and subspecies of Orconectes, and 13 species and subspecies of Procambarus; the former two are confined to the United States and the latter is present also in Cuba and Mexico; the monotypic Troglocambarus is restricted to peninsular Florida. The other two endemic groups, the families Aeglidae and Pseudothelphusidae, are represented, respectively, by a single species of the genus Aegla occurring in Brazil and one of Potamocarcinus in Chiapas, Mexico. The remaining widespread family Grapsidae encompasses a member of the genus Sesarma in Jamaica. Following a presentation of the composition of the fauna and a historical account of investigations leading to our present knowledge of it is a discussion of the evolution of the several groups and a key to aid in the identification of members of the fauna. The systematic section includes synonymies for the genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies. Each of the supraspecific taxa is diagnosed, its range defined, and the numbers of species and troglobitic or anchialine representatives noted. For each species and subspecies, as complete a synonymy as we have been able to obtain is provided. Also a diagnosis, the maximum size, disposition of the types, type-locality, and range (including locality records) are followed by a summary of available ecological and life-history data; illustrations are provided for each. Appended to this study is a list of the non-troglobitic decapods that are known to occur in subterranean habitats, a glossary of terms employed in the text, and a list of the symbionts of American troglobitic decapods.

N2  - Phoxocephalidae are found to be the most diverse family of benthic marine amphipods in southern Australia. This study reports on 88 species in 26 genera. Most of the taxa are described as new. The Phoxocephalidae of the world are reorganized by the description of 8 new subfamilies and the removal of all but 2 species from Paraphoxus either to new genera or by indication that new genera must be described. Some taxa of Australian phoxocephalids are shown to be the most primitive known to exist, especially Pontharpinia and a new subfamily Tipimeginae. Lines of evolutionary deployment radiate outward from Australia to South America and then northward into the northern hemisphere. The expected close relationship to urothoids and pontoporeids is briefly discussed; in addition, an affinity to Ponto-Caspian gammaroids is also explored. Extraordinarily dense populations of phoxocephalids are found in embayments of Australia, especially Western Port and Port Phillip Bay.

N2  - The entocytherid ostracods are obligate external symbionts of crayfishes, and in North Carolina comprise 31 species distributed among 13 genera. Except for five species that seem to be restricted to burrowing crayfishes, all infest more than one host species. Following a brief historical account of the studies of the species reported to occur in North Carolina are discussions of the topography and drainage systems of the State, entocytherid infestations and associates, hosts and the ostracods infesting them, zoogeographic and ecological distributions, life history, and taxonomic characteristics employed in recognizing the North Carolina entocytherid fauna. Keys to the genera and species introduce the annotated list containing synonymies, diagnoses of the genera and species, type-localities, ranges, hosts, and entocytherid associates. Illustrations and distribution maps are also provided for each species. A new genus, Aphelocythere, is proposed to receive a previously undescribed species, A. acuta. Five additional new species are included from the State: Dactylocythere isabelae, D. peedeensis, Donnaldsoncythere leptodrilus, Entocythere costata, and Harpagocythere baileyi. Nine of the 31 species occur in the Coastal Plain Province of the State, 19 in the Piedmont, and 17 in the Mountain Province. Fourteen species are restricted to the Atlantic slope, four to streams draining into the Gulf of Mexico, and 13 occur on both sides of the Appalachian Divide.

N2  - This study was conducted between December 1972 and November 1974 and included some 2100 hours of observation. Blue monkeys usually lived in "one-adult male" social groups that included 13 to 27 animals (= 20.8). The large disparity in the adult sex ratio of these groups was partly accounted for by the emigration of young males that lived as solitary individuals at least for a short period after leaving their parental groups.Blue monkeys frequently formed large mixed-species groupings with one or more of the other primates living in the study area and these associations probably functioned in the avoidance of predation. Associations with the folivorous red colobus (Colobus badius) probably enhanced the acquisition of invertebrate food, while other types of associations, particularly with redtails (Cercopithecus ascanius), may have resulted in efficient location of food resources. Polyspecific associations seemed to be avoided during the times blue monkeys fed on plant foods.Blue monkeys exploited a large number of food plants but tended to be selective feeders. Fruits were usually the most frequently used plant component, but foliar foods and invertebrates were periodically used at high frequencies. Spearman rank correlation tests indicated (1) a significant negative correlation between the frequency of use of fruits and indices of diet diversity computed on the basis of the Shannon-Wiener equation, and (2) a significant positive correlation between the frequency of use of foliar foods and indices of diet diversity. The use of food resources showed considerable intermonthly variations and depended on availability, relative abundance, and the dietary preferences of the blue monkeys. The frequency of food intake and the composition of the diet of four age/sex classes were found to differ. The adult male seemed to adopt a "time minimizing" feeding strategy and exploited a larger proportion of fruits and a smaller proportion of invertebrates than adult females, subadults, and juveniles.Blue monkeys of the Kibale Forest occupied relatively large home ranges. On a daily basis, however, they used only a small portion of their home range and the size of daily ranges varied appreciably during different sample periods. Overlaps in areas used on different days of a sample period were usually small. Thus on the average less than 5% of the area used during a sample period was used on all five days of the sample period, while about 66% was visited on only one day of the sample period.Phenological data collected during the study suggested that differential use of the home range was affected by variations in food abundance. Spearman rank correlation tests showed that ranging patterns were related to the location and exploitation of abundant food resources. In addition the ranging patterns appeared to be partially affected by climatic factors and the location of areas used for night resting.

A new family, Acanthopteroctetidae, is proposed for the endemic North American genus, Acanthopteroctetes. The Australian-Fijian family Agathiphagidae is removed from the Eriocranioidea and placed in the new superfamily Agathiphagoidea. Distribution maps and keys are provided for all species. The larval stages for nearly half of the known Nearctic eriocraniid species are described for the first time. All stages are fully illustrated by line drawings and photographs.

N2  - Anisochromis straussi is described from the isolated St. Brandon's Sholas in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The species exhibits two types of color patterns, which are correlated to some degree with size and sex. Histological sections of the gonads indicate that all testes have a nonfunctional cavity that represents the remnant of the ovarian lumen, and all have remnants of oocytes among the acini. The smaller specimens are female, the larger, males. Evidence is presented that the Anisochromidae, Pseudoplesiopidae, and Pseudochromidae form a monophyletic group. Evidence is also presented that within this group the Pseudoplesiopidae and Anisochromidae form a monophyletic group and each of these two taxa is definable based on autapomorphies. The Pseudochromidae appear to be a possibly polyphyletic primitive residue group that is not definable on the basis of autapomorphies. The lowest phylogenetic level for which there is evidence of monophyly among the fishes currently assigned to the Anisochromidae, Pseudoplesiopidae, and Pseudochromidae was chosen as the level for family recognition. Pseudochromidae is the oldest family-group name available for this level.

N2  - We report here on the results of a two year investigation into the interactions of sex change, coloration, and mating behavior in nine Caribbean wrasses (Bodianus rufus, Halichoeres bivittatus, H. garnoti, H. maculipinna, H. pictus, H. poeyi, H. radiatus, Clepticus parrae, and Thalassoma bifasciatum). For each species, we outline (1) the distribution of sexual types according to size and coloration, (2) the testis weights of different types of males, (3) characteristic habitat and relative abundance, (4) the social and mating system, and (5) breeding seasonality. In all dichromatic labrid species, sex change from female to male appears to precede a change of coloration into the bright terminal phase. Two wrasses (B. rufus and C. parrae) that lack non-sex-changed (primary) males have mating systems in which terminal phase males can effectively control the spawning of the females. Other labrid species have lek-type mating systems, within which small primary males interfere in the spawnings of large terminal males. This activity is reflected in the high testis weight of these small males, who face sperm competition in mating. There is a general correlation between population density (measured by relative abundance) and frequency of primary males.

N2  - The interactions of protogynous sex change, coloration, and mating behavior in ten species of Caribbean parrotfishes are outlined. The species considered are Cryptotomus roseus, Sparisoma rubripinne, S. chrysopterum, S. viride, S. aurofrenatum, S. radians, S. atomarium, Scarus vetula, S. croicensis, and S. taeniopterus. For each, we outline (1) the distribution of sexual types according to size and coloration, (2) the testis weight of different types of males, (3) characteristic habitat and relative abundance, (4) the social and mating system, and (5) breeding seasonality. Non-sex-changing (primary) males are absent in the sparisomatines but present in the scarinines and prematurational sex change is much more common among the sparisomatine species. There are also very large overlaps in size and coloration among the various sexual types of the sparisomatines. Large testes are present in small males of some species, and this is related to their interference spawning strategy. In species that do not occur at high density but do have haremic mating systems, small males are rare or absent. This is probably due to an increased ability of large males to control spawning in females. Haremic species are much more common in the parrotfishes than in the wrasses, perhaps because of basic differences in the distribution of food resources in time and space.

N2  - This global study of the systematics and distribution of the edwardsii species group is based upon examination of several hundred micronekton samples collected at stations scattered throughout the world ocean. Eight species, including three new ones, are recognized and described. Although the group is represented in all tropical and in certain subtropical oceanic regions, individual species have geographically restricted ranges. Conventional and numerical phyletic analyses reveal at least two, and perhaps three, closely related yet distinct lineages within the group. Species distributions tend to be allopatric or parapatric, overlap being most extensive between species of different lineages. Evidence of character divergence in reproductive structures of co-occurring species is discussed.

N2  - The genus Gobiopsis Steindachner comprises ten species, four of which are described as new. Five monotypic genera are placed in the synonymy of Gobiopsis, namely Pogonogobius H. M. Smith, Pipidonia H. M. Smith, Herreogobius Koumans, Barbatogobius Koumans, and Abranches J.L.B. Smith. Salient characters of the genus include the following: a broad, depressed head with pug-nosed snout; head with barbels in particular positions; cutaneous papillae and cephalic sensory pore and canal systems interrelated; sensory pores large, some on tubes, slit-like and hooded; a fleshy midcheek fold; and a dark sickle-shaped mark at base of pectoral fin. The species we recognize in Gobiopsis are Gobiopsis macrostoma Steindachner, Hetereleotris arenarius Snyder, Pipidonia quinquecincta H. M. Smith, Ctenogobius malekulae Herre, Macgregorella bravoi Herre, and Abranches pinto J.L.B. Smith. The four new species are G. angustifrons, G. aporia, G. canalis, and G. woodsi, which are variously distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. Two species groups are defined. A key is given differentiating the species. Distributions of the species are plotted on maps. Drawings and photographs of the heads or bodies of all species are provided.The genus is distributed along the tropical continental slopes of Africa, Asia, Australia, and major islands of the East Indies and Philippines; it has not been found in the Red Sea, the insular Indian Ocean areas, nor Oceania.The various and elaborate development of cephalic sensory structures, the general body physiognomy including the depressed head and upturned snout, and the obliterative color pattern are, apparently, adaptations of subsurface dwelling species for preferred habitats of sandy, muddy, or coral-rubble areas.

N2  - The genus Nannostomus was recently reviewed by Weitzman and Cobb (Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, number 186, 1975). The three new species described here are based on specimens found in a survey of the collections of the Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The new species are N. nitidus from IgarapÃ© Candiru-Mirim near BadajÃ³s, Rio Capim, ParÃ¡; N. britskii from an igarapÃ© of Lago JosÃ©-AÃ§u, Parintins, Amazonas; and N. limatus from an igarapÃ© tributary to Lago MaparÃ¡ near SantarÃ©m, the Rio MaicÃ¡ near SantarÃ©m, and the Lago JacupÃ¡ near OriximinÃ¡, all in the State of ParÃ¡.As with the other species in the genus, the phylogenetic relationships of the new ones remain unclear. Nannostomus britskii shares a complex apomorphic color pattern with N. eques suggesting a possible relationship between the two, but N. britskii lacks the apomorphic caudal structure and probably the swimming position shared by N. eques and N. unifasciatus. Possible relationships among these three species need further investigation. No close relationships with other species of Nannostomus are suggested for N. limatus or N. nitidus. A key is provided for the identification of all species in the genus.SÃ£o descritas trÃªs espÃ©cies novas do gÃªnero Nannostomus da parte inferior da Bacia Amazonica, Brasil: N. nitidus, da Ã¡rea do Rio Capim no Estado do ParÃ¡, N. britskii do Lago JosÃ© AÃ§u, Parintins, Estado do Amazonas e N. limatus dos lagos MaparÃ¡ e JacupÃ¡ e Rio MaicÃ¡, Estado do ParÃ¡. As novas espÃªcies elevam para 14 o nÃºmero total de espÃ©cies reconhecidas, das quais 6 foram descritas nos Ãºltimas 25 anos em um gÃªnero conhecido a mais de 100 anos. Isto mostra que, possivelmente, mais espÃ©cies possam ser descobertas nas complexas faunas de peixes das bacias Amazonica e do Orenoco, bem como nos rios costeiros do este situados entre elas.As relaÃ§Ãµes entre N. limatus e N. nitidus com as outras espÃ©cies do gÃªnero nÃ£o sÃ£o claras. N. britskii, entretanto, possui em comum com N. eques um padrÃ£o de colorido aparentemente especializado e nÃ£o encontrado nos outros membros do gÃªnero. Este fato parece indicar que existe uma relaÃ§Ã£o muito maior entre estas dues espÃ©cies do que com as demais espÃ©cies do gÃªnero. Esta hipÃ³tese, entretanto, precisa ser investigada, tendo em vista que Weitzman (1966) e Weitzman e Cobb (1975) sugeriram, com base na morfologia da nadadeira caudal e na postura de natazÃ§Ã£o, que N. eques e N. unifasciatus sÃ£o mais relacionados entre si. NÃ£o hÃ¡ evidÃªncia de que N. britskii e N. unifasciatus sejam intimamente relacionados, uma vez que N. britskii nÃ£o possui a morfologia especializada da nadadeira caudal de N. eques e de N. unifasciatus e provavelmente tambÃ©m nÃ£o possui a posiÃ§Ã£o caracterÃ­stica "focinho para cima" durante a nataÃ§Ã£o, peculiar a estas duas espÃ©cies. As relaÃ§Ãµes filogenÃ©ticas da maior parte das espÃ©cies do gÃªnero permanecem obscuras.

Spatial dynamics of the population are reviewed and correlated with adult social behavior. Social behavior in the litter prior to dispersal is described and mating dynamics of the species is discussed in detail. Data on foraging behavior are provided, with especial emphasis on the energetics of food-hoarding behavior. Finally, a theoretical framework is proposed that relates spatial and temporal patterning of food resources to the social and spatial systems of the eastern chipmunk.

N2  - The amphipod genus Stygobromus is widespread in the subterranean waters of the United States and is recorded from a variety of groundwater habitats. A revised diagnosis of the genus is given and a tentative division into three subgeneric groups is proposed. The recently proposed synonymy of Stygonectes and Apocrangonyx with Stygobromus is reaffirmed. Forty-eight described species are herein recognized from the Appalachian and Coastal Plain regions of the eastern United States, of which 30 are newly described, three are completely redescribed, and new systematic data are given for the remainder. In addition, six populations are provisionally recognized as distinct species but are not described because of lack of adequate material. On the basis of morphology and geographic distribution, 12 species groups are recognized in the eastern United States, eight of these being newly established herein.Ancestral stygobromids are now believed to have occurred earlier in the freshwater environment than originally suggested. Species of Stygobromus occupy a diversity of groundwater and groundwater-related habitats in the eastern United States, including primarily cave pools and streams, phreatic reservoirs and the hypotelminorheic media of seeps and small springs. Habitat selection is based on niche breadth and movement through shallow groundwater, both of which are believed to be significant factors in dispersal and geographic distribution. A number of species occur syntopically and/or sympatrically but most closely allied species have allopatric ranges. The possibility that several species are glacial relicts of the Pleistocene is raised.

The family Oncaeidae is defined in this report, and a key is given for its five genera. Of these, the genus Lubbockia is defined in detail, and a key (Figure 2) is given for its 11 species. Relationships within the genus, as well as to other oncaeids, are discussed. The bulk of the report is based on seven Lubbockia species collected from the plankton of the northeast Pacific Ocean; most of these species are also widely distributed elsewhere. Descriptions, illustrations, and notes on distributions are provided for these seven species, four of which are new. Descriptive notes and illustrations are also given for two other Lubbockia species known from tropical and subtropical areas of the Pacific.

N2  - Five Australian species (four of them new) in four genera of the new family Platyischnopidae and seven Australian new species of Urothoides, a genus of Urothoidae, are described. Two non-Australian species formerly assigned to Platyischnopus (Platyischnopidae) are placed in a new genus, Indischnopus. Three of the four Australian genera of Platyischnopidae are new: Tomituka, Yurrokus, and Tittakunara. The Australian species of Urothoides appear to be more primitive than the type-species from Kerguelen Island.

N2  - The holotype of Oxuderces dentatus Eydoux and Souleyet, 1842, type-genus and species (and only reported specimen) of the Family Oxudercidae, is an aberrant specimen lacking pelvic fins of a gobiid species normally having pelvic fins. Oxudercidae GÃ¼nther, 1861, is a junior synonym of Gobiidae Cuvier, 1816. Oxudercidae, Amblyopina, and Trypauchenina (all GÃ¼nther, 1861) are the next oldest family-group names available in the Gobiidae.Normal specimens of Oxuderces dentatus have been described as Apocryptichthys sericus Herre, Apocryptes pellegrini Wu, and Apocryptichthys livingstoni Fowler, all of which are junior synonyms of O. dentatus. In current literature, normal specimens of O. dentatus are generally assigned to the genus Apocryptichthys Day, 1876 (type-species: Apocryptes cantoris Day, 1871) and often reported as Apocryptichthys cantoris. Subsequent to the original description of A. cantoris, Day changed his concept of the species and caused later workers much confusion. The number of species or specimens comprising Day's type material of Apocryptes cantoris is unknown, but only one specimen is extant. The specimen, which conforms to current concepts of the genus Boleophthalmus Valenciennes, 1837, is designated lectotype of Apocryptes cantoris.

N2  - Less than 40 percent of the Galapagan littoral Gammaridea are endemic and almost all affinity lies with the eastern Pacific continental fauna. The strictly littoral Gammaridea of the Galapagos Islands and the Gulf of California are impoverished of specific diversity in comparison with the richer shores of California and Australia. Evolutionary events at high level are few in the entire eastern Pacific Ocean. Only one family, Bateidae, is endemic to American waters and the majority of species belong to "invasive" cosmopolitan genera. Newly described genera are Anchialella, Posophotis, Varohios, and Zoedeutopus, and new species are described in the following genera: Ampithoe, Anchialella, Dulzura, Elasmopus, Gitanopsis, Heterophlias, Hyale, Lembos, Maera, Microjassa, Najna, Pontogeneia, Posophotis, Varohios, Zoedeutopus.

Oratosquilla tweediei Manning, 1971 is synonymized with O. woodmasoni and O. jakartensis Moosa, 1975 also is shown to be identifiable with that species. Syntypes of Squilla affinis var. intermedia Nobili, 1903, are identified with four different species. Nine species are described as new: O. asiatica, O. gravieri, O. hindustanica, O. pentadactyla, O. solicitans, O. stephensoni, O. striata, O. subtilis, and O. turbata. Species groups in Oratosquilla are reexamined; two are redefined and five are recognized. Two new genera are proposed for species previously assigned to Oratosquilla, which now includes 31 nominal species.

N2  - Many arctic marine mollusks exhibit much greater intraspecific variation in shell shape and sculpturing and greater interspecific morphological overlap than temperate or tropical species of the same families. Tropical marine mollusks ordinarily exhibit more pronounced interspecific morphological distinctness in mixed-species communities and more remarkable intraspecific polychromatism in single-species dominated communities than their temperate or arctic relatives. A number of groups do not exhibit any variability shifts with latitude but shifts opposite to those here described have not been observed. Changes in the nature and intensity of natural selection, which are deemed to occur with increased biome maturation, appear to account for these morphological trends.

N2  - Frogs evolved as jumping machines. The earliest recognized anuran fossil possessed a foreshortened body and elongated hindlimbs, primary adaptations for jumping. The majority of extant frogs retain jumping as their primary mode of locomotion. Eighty species of frogs were tested to determine their absolute and relative (jumping distance divided by snout-vent length) jumping abilities. The species include representatives from the Ascaphidae, Bufonidae, Dendrobatidae, Pelodryadidae, Discoglossidae, Hylidae, Leptodactylidae, Microhylidae, Myobatrachidae, Pelobatidae, and Ranidae. Jumping performance is examined relative to taxonomic and habitat group, fatigue, body size, and sex. The ranking of jumping ability (distance jumped divided by body length) among the sampled species from weakest to strongest is Bufonidae, Pelobatidae, Discoglossidae, Microhylidae, Ranidae, Leptodactylidae, Dendrobatidae, Ascaphidae, Myobatrachidae, Hylidae, and Pelodryadidae for the families of frogs and semifossorial terrestrial, treetop arboreal, semiaquatic-terrestrial, terrestrial, scrub arboreal, and grass arboreal for the habitat groupings. Weak jumping species show little evidence of fatigue, whereas strong jumpers show a progressive decline in performance. Males tend to jump farther than equivalent-sized females, although the opposite or neutral situation occurs in a few species. Both inter- and intraspecifically, large frogs jump farther than small ones; however, a comparison of relative ability shows small frogs to be the strongest jumpers.

N2  - Collections and observations made by the author during a field survey in October-December 1975 provide the basis for an account of distribution, habitats, food habits, reproduction, migratory behavior, and systematics of the Fly ichthyofauna, which comprises 103 species in 33 families. Two anchovies, four catfishes, an atherinid, an apogonid, and three gobies are described as new. Of particular interest among these new forms are an anchovy with unusually numerous gill rakers, a large piscivorous ariid catfish, a specialized montane plotosid catfish, and a distinctive Pseudomugil. Arius digulensis Hardenberg, 1936, and Hemipimelodus aaldareni Hardenberg, 1936, are placed as synonyms of Arius acrocephalus Weber, 1913, and Hemipimelodus macrorhynchus Weber, 1913. Arius danielsi Regan, 1908, is referred to the hitherto monotypic genus Cochlefelis, and Paraphya semivestita Munro, 1949, is referred to Gobiopterus. Keys are provided to the species of freshwater Ariidae of southern New Guinea and to the Glossamia of New Guinea.The freshwater ichthyofauna of the Australian Region, typified by that of the Fly, evolved in the absence of the primary freshwater groups of Ostariophysi and non-Ostariophysi that dominate freshwater ichthyofaunas in other continental regions. Among the peculiar features of the Fly ichthyofauna are: the presence of several groups that are absent or poorly represented in riverine ichthyofaunas of other regions, unusually large size of many species, paucity of very small species, endemic montane species in Plotosidae and Clupeidae, stenophagous molluscivorous and carcinophagous ariid catfishes, and a diverse assemblage of forms suspected or known to have catadromous life histories.The Lorentz and Digul rivers of West Irian, and probably other large rivers in central-southern New Guinea, are inhabitated by much the same ichthyofauna as the Fly. Although at least 12 families evolved endemic species in these rivers, there have been no extensive radiations comparable to those undergone by numerous families of primary freshwater fishes in other continental regions.

The genus Opogona is reported for the first time from the United States, and two new species are described as O. arizonensis and O. floridensis. Opogona purpuriella Swezey is also reported as a port interception in California, but it is not believed to be established yet within the continental United States. The adults of five species are fully illustrated, as are the larvae and pupae of Opogona omoscopa (Meyrick) and Oinophila v-flava (Haworth). The family relationships of the genera are reviewed, and it is concluded that they represent valid members of the family Tineidae.

N2  - Bufo marinus is one of the most common and widespread anurans of Central and South America, yet little is known of its natural history in native habitats. Through a survey of the literature and brief ecological studies in Panama, we attempted to summarize the natural history of the toads. Emphasis is placed on distribution, sexual maturity, reproductive cycles, body size and growth, population structure and size, food and feeding behavior, activity and movements, thermal physiology, and water balance.In general, marine toads have one or two breeding seasons each year, apparently timed so metamorphosis occurs during periods of high humidity and prey abundance. Toadlets grow rapidly and reach the size of sexual maturity (approximately 90 mm snout-vent length) at about one year from metamorphosis, although they may not breed their first year. Populations in semi-natural habitats are of moderately high density, 50 to 150 late term juvenile to adult toads per hectare. One-year-old toads comprise at least 50 percent of total population with a progressive and rapid decline of the older year classes. Apparently two-thirds of the population turns over each year. The toads are opportunistic feeders with ants and beetles predominating in their diet. Most toads are quite mobile, changing feeding sites regularly within a forage area of roughly 160 sq m. A toad is generally active one evening out of every three or four; however, weather conditions do alter activity patterns. The toads have a broad temperature tolerance but have no or little control of water loss. The dry season and the resulting desiccation may be a major mortality factor.

N2  - The New World genus Parascatella and the triseta group of the genus Scatella are revised. Parascatella is redefined to include species now known only from the temperate regions of South America. Of the 11 species included in Parascatella, 10 are newly described. These 11 are arrayed into two species-groups, the pilifera and brunnea groups. Most specimens of the pilifera group were collected at between 3000 and 4500 m elevation in northwestern Argentina and adjacent areas of Chile and Peru. The brunnea group is represented by a single species from southern Chile (between 46Â° and 53Â° south latitude) at elevations of approximately 400 m. The three species presently comprising the triseta group of the genus Scatella are also treated. These three species were formerly included in Parascatella when the latter was recognized either as a genus or as a subgenus of Scatella. All three species of the triseta group occur primarily in western North America. Our revised classification is founded on a phylogeny that is proposed using cladistic methods of analysis. The criteria used for recognition of species and of infra- and suprageneric groupings are discussed. Keys to the genera, species-groups, and species based on adult characteristics are provided. Pertinent character states are illustrated using line drawings or scanning electron micrographs. All included taxa are described or redescribed, and appropriate synonymies are listed. Distribution maps are provided for most species. Evolutionary considerations, natural history, and zoogeography are discussed.

Eviota viridis (Waite) and E. verna Smith are placed in the synonymy of E. prasina, and E. stigmapteron Smith is synonymized with E. distigma.Characters describing the genus are presented. A key is given and meristic data are tabulated that differentiate the species. All of the species are illustrated by photographs or a drawing. A diagnosis of each species is included.Eviota pardalota is apparently endemic to the Red Sea; E. guttata is only known from the Red Sea and the Gulf of Oman. Eviota distigma, E. prasina, E. sebreei, and E. zebrina are Red Sea inhabitants that are wide-ranging, with some-what similar distributions in the Indo-Pacific region. The six species occurred together only in the Gulf of Aqaba. The distribution of certain species in the Red Sea as shown by our data may be related to collectng effort and practices and perhaps to certain natural conditions.

N2  - The North American species of the shore fly genus Notiphila FallÃ©n were revised. Over 13,000 specimens were examined from throughout the Nearctic Region, and information relating to the natural history of many species occurring in the West was gathered from both field and laboratory studies. Previously used characters were reevaluated; new characters from comparative morphological studies of the male terminalia, from development stages, and from biological and ecological observations were collected. A phylogeny is proposed based on cladistic analysis; and the phenetic relationships were assessed using standard numerical taxonomic procedures. Collectively, all these data were assessed and a classification derived.Species of Dichaeta Meigen are relegated to species-group status, but the name becomes the senior synonym of Agrolimna Cresson as one of the subgeneric names. In the subgenus Notiphila, three species-groups are recognized, comprising 25 species, of which 14 are new or required new names. In the subgenus Dichaeta, 23 species are recognized, 7 are new. Species of the subgenus Dichaeta are arrayed into four species-groups. The basis for the classification is discussed and illustrations of the important character states are included. The natural history and zoogeography of the nearctic species are briefly discussed.

N2  - The vertical distribution, seasonal occurrence, relative abundance, spawning cycles, growth trends, and relationship to water types of 36 species of oceanic cephalopods are delineated from the Deepwater Dumpsite 106 (DWD 106) based on four seasonal cruises. The most commonly captured species were Pterygioteuthis gemmata, Abraliopsis pfefferi, Illex illecebrosus, Histioteuthis reversa, and Mastigoteuthis magna. Information on probable spawning seasons was gained for the first time for I. illecebrosus, A. pfefferi, P. gemmata, H. reversa, Megalocranchia megalops, and Alloposus mollis. Closing-net captures provided data on several species for which vertical distributions formerly were unknown: M. magna, Abralia redfieldi, A. veranyi, Ancistroteuthis lichtensteini, Histioteuthis elongata, Egea inermis. Mastigoteuthis magna is recorded for the first time since its original description in 1913. Several species occurred primarily in a particular water type. For example, H. reversa, A. pfefferi, and M. megalops occurred primarily in slope water, Chiroteuthis veranyi occurred only in (warm core) eddy water, while P. gemmata occurred about equally in both water types. Tests of co-occurrence of species between water types and cruises indicated that the species compositions were largely dissimilar. Only five species occurred on all four cruises: A. pfefferi, H. reversa, M. magna, T. pavo, and A. mollis, while five additional species occurred on any three of the four cruises.

N2  - As the result of the study of over 7000 specimens, about half of them personally collected during two weeks on Easter Island and the remainder borrowed from or examined in museums and other institutions, the presence of 133 species of marine and halophilic mollusks is recorded from Easter Island. Only three species (all common on Easter Island) are recorded from Sala y GÃ³mez. Of these 133 species, 18 are identified only to genus or family because they are represented by material too insufficient or too imperfect on which to base a description, or because their taxonomy is still under study. There are 48 endemic species, a 42 percent endemicity, which would seem to justify Schilder's proposal of a distinct Rapanuian biogeographical province for Easter Island and Sala y GÃ³mez. The faunal relationships are primarily closest to Hawaii and secondarily to Pitcairn-Rapa-Kermadecs-northern New Zealand, a pattern that may point to these three areasâ€”Hawaii, Easter Island, and Pitcairn-Kermadecsâ€”as relicts of a former, more widely distributed fauna. Following the introductory, descriptive, and analytical sections, the 133 species, assigned to 65 families, are recorded or described. The majority of species are figured. Forty species and two subspecies are described as new, and three new genera are proposed.An addendum presents revisions occasioned by the appearance of a paper that includes significant new knowledge of the mollusks of Hawaii.

N2  - The nomenclatural history of the Abyssochrysidae and the uncertainty of their taxonomic placement and phylogenetic relationships are discussed. One genus and two species are recognized, Abyssochrysos melanoides Tomlin and A. melvilli (Schepman), both from the bathyal zone. Shells, radulae, and gross anatomy indicate that the Abyssochrysidae are simple mesogastropods. The animals are blind, have deep mantle cavities, long monopectinate ctenidia, closed pallial gonoducts, and a large, right-dorsal mantle process that is interpreted as a copulatory organ. The rachidian tooth of the taenioglossate radula is unique among prosobranchs. Anatomical features do not fit the limits of any recent prosobranch superfamily. The shells are superficially like those of fresh-water melanians, but do not closely resemble those of any other living or Cenozoic group.Descriptions of the two living species and their synonymies, bathymetric and geographic distributions are presented. The shell physiognomy of Abyssochrysos species is closest to that of members of the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic families Zygopleuridae Wenz and Pseudozygopleuridae Knight of the superfamily Loxonematacea Koken. The Abyssochrysidae are provisionally assigned to the Loxonematacea and are considered to have close affinities to the superfamilies Viviparacea, Valvatacea, Rissoacea, and Cerithiacea.

N2  - Three hundred and sixty-six species of birds have been recorded on or near Barro Colorado Island, a 14.8 km2 forested area in Gatun Lake in the Panama Canal Zone. Of these 366 species, 217 breed or formerly bred on the island; 11 of the 217 are birds of the edge of Gatun Lake rather than land birds. Migrants breeding in North or South America number 83 species, including 25 from the lake.Nine of the 217 resident species immigrated to the island from nearby lowland areas since the early 1950s, but four of the nine have already disappeared. In addition to the four lost immigrants, 51 formerly resident species have disappeared from the island, leaving 162 species resident in 1977. Most of the extirpated former residents have been lost because of growth of forest and consequent loss of second-growth habitats. Some 16 of the 51 extirpated species seem to be birds of forest; their loss may be due to the small size of the island and to tendencies for small remnants of forest to retain few species.

N2  - Hacienda Palo Verde is located geographically in northwestern Costa Rica, climatically and vegetationally in the Tropical Dry Forest life zone. Avifaunally it is the southern terminus of the Central American Arid Avifauna ranging southward in the Pacific lowlands from western Mexico. Palo Verde is also the site of a field station of the Organization for Tropical Studies, and it possesses one of the few remaining areas of tropical dry forest. Until recently a cattle ranch, it has been decreed a protected area and will soon become a national park. To my knowledge this is the first comprehensive report on the avifauna of any locality in the Central American Arid Pacific lowlands. It is intended to provide a point of reference for the making of avifaunal or environmental comparisons among comparably known localities anywhere in tropical America.

Twenty-eight species are discussed from Pacific localities and 35 species from the Caribbean. Sixteen species are now known to be found on both shores of Middle America. Previous literature on Middle American pycnogonids is reviewed and a resumÃ© of faunal affinities is given for both oceans. It is proposed that there is no endemic pycnogonid fauna on either the Caribbean or Pacific coasts of Middle America. Diagnostic keys, references, and distribution records are provided for all shallow-water pycnogonids of this region.

N2  - The nearctic species of Lamproscatella are revised. Keys to subgenera and species, illustrations, and distribution maps are provided. Lamproscatella is divided into three subgenera, each of which is hypothesized to be monophyletic, being based on apotypic character states. The relationships among species within each subgenus are also outlined, again being based on apotypic character states. Assuming, among other assumptions, that the cladograms are reasonably correct, the zoogeography for each subgenus is discussed. I suggest that Lamproscatella had its origins in western North America and that through dispersal and subsequent vicariance events, the species of each subgenus differentiated and became more widespread in the Northern Hemisphere. The subgenus Lamproscatella eventually dispersed to most of the Old World (including Africa and Asia), where further vicariance events resulted in the species occurring there now. As barriers to partition the range of ancestral species, I propose the existent topography of the Pliocene-Pleistocene coupled with the rather dramatic climatic events of these periods.

Descriptions of the new species are provided and a redescription of G. atrata is presented. Gobiopsis exigua is known from two widely disjunct regions, the Gilbert and Fiji Islands, Pacific Ocean, and the Comores and Amirantes Islands, western Indian Ocean. Gobiopsis springeri is known only by the holotype taken at Ceram, Indonesia, and G. atrata is endemic to the New Zealand fauna. The scope of the generic concept is broadened and a revised generic diagnosis is presented. An expanded key includes 13 species allocated to the genus. The monotypic genus, Feia Smith, and type-species, F. nympha Smith, are redescribed and the superficial relationship of the genus Feia to Gobiopsis is compared and discussed. The two new species and G. atrata, all other species of Gobiopsis collectively, and Feia nympha are compared in Tables 2 and 3 using 21 meristic, sensory, various morphological, and color characters, and their interrelationships are discussed in the text.The inclusion of the three species within Gobiopsis expands the known range of the genus to include certain tropical insular areas of the Indian and Pacific oceans and the temperate waters of New Zealand.

N2  - These three small-to-moderate-sized snakes have small egg clutches, modal of 3 in C. fissidens, 2 in D. catesbyi, and 2 in I. cenchoa. Coniophanes fissidens may have a seasonal reproductive cycle with egg laying concentrated in the months of May to September; D. catesbyi and I. cenchoa are probably aseasonal in Peru, but the latter may have a seasonal cycle in northern Central America. Estimates of growth rates and the monthly distribution of size classes suggest that the females of all three species require a minimum of two years to reach sexual maturity. The size (snout-vent length) at sexual maturity for females is 250 mm for C. fissidens, 335 mm for D. catesbyi, and 620 mm for I. cenchoa. Coniphanes fissidens and I. cenchoa have a 30 and 10 percent incidence of broken tails; analysis of these data shows no indication of differential predation of the sexes. The sex ratio of adults closely approximates 1:1 in the three species. Sample sizes were inadequate to demonstrate either presence or absence of geographic variation in reproductive parameters.

N2  - Sixteen mensural and pattern characters are analyzed for the adult members of the Leptodactylus pentadactylus species group. Available data on tadpoles, mating calls, and karyotypes are incorporated in the analyses. Results of the analyses lead to the recognition of 11 species comprising the group. For each species, the following are provided: synonymy, description of adult characteristics, a distribution map and list of localities, and specimens examined. The following are included if known: distinctive adult colors in life, larval characteristics, mating call description, and karyotype. A key is provided for the adult members of the complex.Larval adaptations appear to be most important in interpreting the evolutionary history within this species group. Adult morphology appears to be evolutionarily rather conservative, contrasting with the patterns found in other species groups so far studied within this genus.

N2  - The West African marine brachyuran crab fauna, comprising 218 named species in 120 genera and 26 familes, is surveyed. Sixteen new genera and 24 new species are recognized. Synonymies are updated for the tropical species, and all 300+ Eastern Atlantic species are listed. Original references and synonymies are provided for all 146 Eastern Atlantic genera. Synonymies have been compiled for all 36 currently recognized families of marine crabs. Twenty-nine families are represented in the Eastern Atlantic fauna. One family, Hexapodidae Miers, 1886, and one subfamily, Camptandriinae Stimpson, 1858 (Ocypodidae) are revised at the generic level. The genera Liocarcinus Stimpson, 1871 (Portunidae), Machaerus Leach, 1818 (Goneplacidae), and Lambdophallus Alcock, 1900, Paeduma Rathbun, 1897, Parahexapus Balss, 1922, Pseudohexapus Monod, 1956, and Thaumastoplax Miers, 1881 (all Hexapodidae), are defined and recognized. It is suggested that the family Geryonidae Colosi, 1923, shows closest affinities with the family Portunidae Rafinesque, 1815.

The subfamily Labrisominae, which was previously included in the Clinidae, is raised to family rank.The Ophiclinini comprises four genera: Ophiclinops, with three species (one new, O. hutchinsi); Ophiclinus, with six species (three new, O. brevipinnis, O. ningulus, and O. pectoralis); Peronedys, monotypic; and Sticharium (= Breona), with two species (one new, S. clarkae). The Ophiclinini are restricted to the southern, cooler waters of Australia. Keys to the genera and species, and illustrations of all species are provided. The following species are synonymized for the first time: Ophioclinus devisi Ogilby = Peronedys anguillaris Steindachner; Breona greeni E.O.G. Scott = Sticharium dorsale GÃ¼nther; Ophiclinus aethiops McCulloch and Waite = Ophiclinus antarcticus Castelnau; Ophiclinus greeni E.O.G. Scott = Ophiclinus gracilis Waite.Stenophus Castelnau and its two included species, S. marmoratus and S. obscurus, both Castelnau, formerly included in the Ophiclinidae, are synonymized under Congrogadus GÃ¼nther and C. subducens (Richardson), family Congrogadidae.

N2  - Subterranean amphipod crustaceans of the suborder Gammaridea have been sampled on a regular basis from the artesian well in San Marcos, Texas, since late 1973. Water in the artesian well comes from the extensive, subterranean Edwards Aquifer, which is associated with the Balcones Escarpment and Fault Zone of south-central Texas. The taxonomically diverse amphipod fauna of the well is believed to be one of the richest of its kind in the world and is composed of five families, six genera, and 10 species. One family, four genera, and six species are newly described herein. Four distinct phylogenetic lineages are represented in the amphipod fauna: crangonyctids, hadzioids, bogidielloids, and sebids.The zoogeographic and ecological implications of the artesian well amphipod fauna are profound. Approximately 80 percent of the species have obvious affinities with marine or brackish water species and are presumably derivatives of marine ancestors that colonized newly opened freshwater habitats during recession of epeiric seas in the Late Cretaceous. The high taxonomic diversity of the amphipod fauna is probably explained by: (1) exposure of south-central Texas to an extensive marine embayment during the Cretaceous period, (2) complex geological structure of the Balcones Fault Zone and large size of the Edwards Aquifer, and (3) ecological complexity of aquatic communities in the Edwards Aquifer.

N2  - This investigation focuses primarily on those ecological and evolutionary aspects involved in the natural history of the bees that utilize the pollen, nectar, or both, of sunflowers (Helianthus) in North America either for their survival as species or for their maintenance in viable populations. This bee-flower association is examined principally by analyses of the intrafloral, geographic, diurnal, and seasonal interrelationships that exist between this fauna of bees and the various species of Helianthus present in North America. On the basis of this study it is established that more than 400 species of native bees visit the flowers of Helianthus in America north of Mexico. Of these it is those species that have evolved a specialized intrafloral relationship with these flowers that serve as the principal pollinators of these plants.

N2  - Twelve species of cyclopoid copepods of the family Oithonidae are described from eastern coastal waters of Central and South America from BelÃ©m, Brazil, to Belize City, Belize. Three are new species: Oithona bjornbergae, O. fonsecae, and Paroithona flemingeri. Sexes of O. plumifera are very similar in the copepoid V stage; the male characters (lack of rostrum, flap on cephalosome and pore signature, and extra outer setae on swimming leg exopods) are acquired during the final molt. Several morphological characters besides the traditional ones are used to separate species: the pattern of male integumental organs (pore signature), the armature of the female genital segment, and the modified endopod setae of the female fourth swimming leg. Spermatophores were found ventrally on urosome segments of O. oculata and O. plumifera. It is suggested that during mating the male grasps the female fourth legs with his geniculate first antennae as in Cyclops, and tactile recognition of the male pore signature is accomplished by the modified endopod setae of the female fourth leg.

N2  - Field investigations of living bivalves of the order Arcoida led to the rediscovery of a contradiction to the longstanding three-fold, three-function concept of bivalve mantle edges. In contrast to the simple secretory role usually ascribed to the outer fold, it was found that this fold is also photoreceptive, having both simple and compound eyes beneath the newly generated periostracum, and that it also may serve as a mantle curtain, controlling the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity. Preserved specimens of Arca zebra, Arca imbricata, Barbatia cancellaria, and Glycymeris glycymeris were subsequently examined by scanning electron microscopy, with particular emphasis on mantle-shell relationships in specimens prepared by critical-point drying.These methods suggest two different modes of calcification: one inside the pallial line and characterized by high calcium mobility, the other outside the pallial line and closely controlled by a fibrous organic film that overlies the growth surface of the marginal shell band and is distinct from the periostracum. The pallial line in the Arcoida is primarily the result of morphological changes in the mantle epithelium and does not represent a continuous line of pallial-retractor insertions. Shell tubules, abundantly present in all arcoids examined, are formed by greatly elongated processes extending into the shell from the apical surfaces of epithelial cells inside the pallial line. These may chemically deter borers. The presence of two marginal mantle folds lateral to the periostracal groove as well as the presence of photoreceptors on one of these suggest that growth of the mantle is not by means of simple conveyorbelt-like proliferation of cells from a single zone. Rather, cell generation in the epithelia outside the pallial line is probably widely distributed, with many cells tending to maintain both their position and function during ontogeny.The peculiar arrangement of marginal mantle folds and the structure of compound eyes both probably result from very early divergence from a primitive bivalve and represent independently derived characters unique to the order Arcoida.

N2  - The classification, morphology, and phylogeny are reviewed for the three families of the superfamily Sesioidea: Brachodidae, Sesiidae, and Choreutidae, of which Brachodidae is newly added to Sesioidea. World genera and species are listed for each family, including new combinations and new synonymies. New replacement names are provided for 7 junior homonyms in Sesiidae (Synanthedon). One new subfamily (Brenthiinae) is described in Choreutidae and one new subfamily (Phycodinae) is described in Brachodidae. Keys are provided for families and subfamilies. Representative species and character features are illustrated for each family for adults, larvae, and pupae. Sesiidae (except Tinthiinae) are shown to possess chaetosemata. Biological information and zoogeography are reviewed for each family to the extent known. Thirteen genera and seven species are newly excluded from Sesioidea families and transferred to other families. Brachodidae are shown to be the most closely related family to Sesiidae. Prochoreutis Heppner, new name, is proposed for use in the Choreutidae section, replacing Choreutis of authors (not Choreutis HÃ¼bner, which replaces Eutromula FrÃ¶lich).

N2  - Previous evidence supposedly showing a relationship between flamingos and either storks (Ciconiiformes) or ducks (Anseriformes) is re-examined in light of the recent hypothesis deriving flamingos from shorebirds of the order Charadriiformes. Anatomical characters used to indicate relationship between flamingos and storks are shown to consist entirely of primitive "non-anseriform" traits found in several other orders, including Charadriiformes. Most of the presumed anseriform characters of flamingos also occur in the Charadriiformes, as do all of the characters of flamingos that do not occur in either Ciconiiformes or Anseriformes. The distinctive life history and behavior of flamingos is demonstrated as being very similar to that of the Recurvirostridae (Charadriiformes), particularly the Australian Banded Stilt (Cladorhynchus leucocephalus), but is unlike that of storks or ducks. The appendicular myology of Cladorhynchus is described and is found to be quite similar to that of flamingos, whereas neither is close to storks. The thigh muscle M. iliotibialis medialis, heretofore considered unique to flamingos, was discovered in Cladorhynchus but not in other Recurvirostridae. Evidence from osteology, natal down, oology, and internal parasites strongly supports a charadriiform derivation of flamingos; pterylosis does not contradict such a relationship; and knowledge of the early evolution of flamingos and Anseriformes offers a logical explanation for their sharing similar mallophagan parasites. The earliest certain flamingo, from the early Middle Eocene of Wyoming, is described herein as a new monotypic genus and species that was intermediate in size and morphology between the Recurvirostridae and modern flamingos. Other aspects of paleontology of flamingos are discussed. Evolutionary steps in the development of filter feeding in birds are outlined. The structure of the feeding apparatus of flamingos is shown to be entirely different from that of the Anseriformes, but is strikingly convergent towards that of baleen whales. Morphological and behavioral precursors for filter feeding are shown to occur in the Charadriiformes but not in the Ciconiiformes. Flamingos (Phoenicopteridae) clearly belong in the order Charadriiformes, suborder Charadrii, immediately following the Recurvirostridae.

N2  - Sixty-six species and subspecies, 18 of which are endemic, comprise the crayfish fauna of Georgia: the genera Cambarus represented by 33, Fallicambarus and Faxonella by 1 each, Orconectes by 3, and Procambarus by 28. Of these, 19 are described as new: Cambarus (Depressicambarus) harti, C. (D.) reflexus, C. (D.) strigosus, C. (D.) truncatus, C. (Hiaticambarus) coosawattae, C. (H.) fasciatus, C. (H.) manningi, C. (H.) speciosus, C. (Lacunicambarus) acanthura, C. (Puncticambarus) coosae, C. (P.) georgiae, C. (P.) hiwasseensis C. (P.) parrishi, C. (P.) scotti, Procambarus (Distocambarus) devexus, P. (Hagenides) caritus, P. (H.) talpoides, P. (Leconticambarus) pubischelae deficiens, and P. (Pennides) petersi. The subgenus Distocambarus is the only new supraspecific taxon proposed. Brief accounts of previous work on the Georgia crayfish fauna, physiographic regions, and drainage systems precede a more detailed discussion of habitats and the crayfishes frequenting them. This is followed by postulates of the affinities and distribution of the extant crayfishes and their ancestors in space and geologic time. Keys are provided for identification of the genera, subgenera, and species. The systematic section consists of synonyms for the genera, subgenera, species, and subspecies. The supraspecific categories are diagnosed, their ranges defined, and the numbers of species and a summary statement of the habitats occupied by them are included. A complete synonomy is presented for each species and subspecies, and for most there is also a complete bibliography; this is followed by a summary of previous reports of the species in Georgia, a diagnosis (and descriptions of new and several previously described species), statements concerning location of types, type-locality, range, specimens examined, variations, ecological and life history data, a list of crayfish associates, and, for new taxa, etymological notes. One of the two appendices consists of a summary of the distribution of the crayfishes in the 159 counties in the state, and the other consists of a list of the crayfishes and the symbionts parasitizing or infesting them. Members of the genera Cambarus and Orconectes are concentrated in upland sections of the state, whereas those of Procambarus are more abundant in the coastal plain and lower piedmont. With few exceptions, representatives of the other genera are largely restricted to the latter. The numbers of species and subspecies occurring in the major drainage basins are as follows: Altamaha 22, Aucilla 1, Chattahoochee 14, Chattooga 9, Coosa 15, Flint 14, Hiwassee 7, Little Tennessee 2, Newport 6, Ochlockonee 3, Ogeechee 16, Saint Marys 7, Satilla 10, Savannah 20, Suwannee 8, Tallapoosa 6, and Tennessee 12. Illustrations include generalized morphological features, habitats, dendrograms postulating affinities, sketches depicting color patterns, morphological characters of each species, and maps noting the localities from which each has been collected.

N2  - The subfamily Cyclasteropinae is revised using the Hennigian system for deriving the cladistics of suprageneric catagories. The Cylindroleberididae is subdivided into 3 subfamilies: Cylindroleberidinae MÃ¼ller, 1906; Cyclasteropinae Poulsen, 1965, and Asteropteroninae, new subfamily, of which the last 2 are treated herein. The Cyclasteropinae is divided into 3 tribes: Cycloleberidini Hartmann 1974, Cyclasteropini Poulsen, 1965, and Tetraleberidini, new tribe. The Cyclasteropini contains only 1 genus, Cyclasterope Brady, 1897. The Cycloleberidini contains 3 genera: Cycloleberis Skogsberg, 1920; Leuroleberis, new genus, and Alphaleberis, new genus. The Tetraleberidini contains 2 genera: Tetraleberis, new genus, and Amboleberis, new genus. The Asteropteroninae contains 7 genera: Actinoseta Kornicker, 1958; Asteropella Poulsen, 1965; Asteropteron Skogsberg, 1920; Microasteropteron Poulsen, 1965; Asteropterygion, new genus; Pteromeniscus, new genus, and Omegasterope, new genus. The following new species are described and illustrated: Leuroleberis sharpei, L. mackenziei, Alphaleberis alphathrix, Tetraleberis maddocksae, T. tanzania, Tetraleberis species 1, Amboleberis antyx, Actinoseta hummelincki, A. jonesi, A. nodosa, Asteropella trithrix, A. slatteryi, A. kaufmani, A. maclaughlinae, Asteropella species 1, Asteropterygion thomassini, A. romei, A. dayi, A. peterseni, Pteromeniscus intesi, and Microasteropteron bacescui. In addition, many old species are redescribed and illustrated. At least 1 species in each genus is illustrated. Keys are presented for the identification of early growth stages as well as for the identification of subfamilies, tribes, genera, and species.With few exceptions members of the Cyclasteropinae and Asteropteroninae are restricted to the continental shelf (0-200 m), and live mostly in the upper 100 m. All species are benthic, but occasionally specimens are collected above the bottom. Members of both subfamilies appear restricted to tropical and temperate waters. The genus Asteropella with 10 species, in addition to 2 left in open catagory, is endemic to American waters. The monotypic genera Pteromeniscus and Omegasterope have been collected only off west Africa. Species of Microasteropteron have been collected only in the Indo-Pacific Region. Faunal resemblances between regions are discussed.The relationship between clutch size and carapace size in the Cylindroleberididae is similar to that in the Cypridinidae and Philomedidae. Ontogenetic development, sexual dimorphism, dimorphism between the adult and juvenile stage are investigated, and the comparative morphology of the various taxa under study is discussed in detail.

N2  - An historical review of the genus Argyropeza is presented. The assignment of the genus within the Cerithiidae is clarified. A close relationship between Argyropeza and Bittium is suggested. Argyropeza species live on soft sediments of continental slopes and island groups in the Indo-Pacific and occur most frequently at bathyal depths. They have pelagic larvae and are sediment feeders. Five nominal species are recognized: Argyropeza divina, A. izekiana, A. schepmaniana, A. verecunda, and A. leucocephala. An appendix with species frequently assigned to or easily confused with Argyropeza is included.

N2  - This catalog lists a total of 584 species in 290 genera: from continental Ecuador, 496 species in 264 genera; from the Galapagos Islands, 101 species in 57 genera with just 3 genera restricted to those islands. Only 13 species are reported for both areas. For continental Ecuador the numbers appear to represent a small fraction of probable forms; for the Galapagos Islands the number of species represents a doubling during the dozen years since Linsley and Usinger's 1966 report of 43 species of Heteroptera from those islands. Inclusion of most species is based on literature records only, sometimes with additional data, and not a few species are included solely on specimen records. Zoogeographical conclusions are mostly deferred until further planned collecting reveals more fully the Ecuadorian fauna. Three nomenclatorial innovations are included: (1) Signoret's Pangaeus vicinus, described from Ecuador, is transferred from synonymy under the North American Pangaeus bilineatus (Say) to synonymy under the common South American Pangaeus aethiops (Fabricius); (2) Ectrichodia geniculosa Walker, described from Ecuador, is transferred for convenience to the new combination Rhiginia geniculosa; and (3) the spelling of the Tingidae tribal name Phatnomini is emended to Phatnomatini.

N2  - Evidence purportedly allying the Anseriformes with the Galliformes is discredited. The discovery of vestigial lamellae in the Anhimidae, in addition to the characters these birds share with the anomalous Australian Magpie Goose (Anseranas), proves their anseriform relationship; within the order Anseriformes, the Anhimidae are highly derived and not representative of the ancestral condition in the order. The abundant Eocene fossil Presbyornis combines the body of a shorebird with a duck-like head and shows the Anseriformes to have evolved from the Charadriiformes. The unique filter-feeding apparatus of Presbyornis and the Anatidae was the key adaptation that led to the radiation of the order Anseriformes. The skull of Presbyornis has its greatest similarity to that of the living Australian duck Stictonetta, which on other grounds has been considered primitive. This suggests that a rearrangement of the subgroups of Anatidae may be needed. The fossil record shows that no certain Anseriformes are known before the early Oligocene, indicating a probable mid-Tertiary date for the major radiation of Anatidae. The ancestors of ducks were Charadriiformes that adapted originally for life in shallow saline lakes, where selection pressure for filter-feeding would have been strong. The Anseriformes should be maintained as a separate order following the Charadriiformes. Presbyornis is considered still to have had a charadriiform grade of morphology and for the present is retained in the Charadriiformes.

N2  - Aneides flavipunctatus, a terrestrial plethodontid salamander, is virtually restricted to humid, thermally equable areas of northwestern California. The limits of distribution mainly reflect the extent of climatically favorable habitat and the presence of longstanding barriers to dispersal, but competition with other species of salamanders may play a role in excluding A. flavipunctatus from mesic, equable areas in the vicinity of the California-Oregon border.Aneides flavipunctatus exhibits marked ontogenetic and geographic variation in color pattern and external proportions. Within the contiguous portion of the range, variation in individual characters tends to be clinal and correlated with latitude, distance inland, elevation, or other geographic parameters. However, isolated populations at the southern and northeastern limits of distribution exhibit discordant variation relative to their nearest neighbors within the contiguous range.Northern populations of A. flavipunctatus retain a suite of juvenile-like characteristics throughout adulthood, and paedomorphism appears to be an important mechanism by which evolutionary changes have occurred in this species. A Prim Network analysis indicates that phenetic and geographic proximity are highly correlated within the contiguous range of A. flavipunctatus, but that peripheral isolates most clearly resemble central "core" populations in morphology.

N2  - The Neotropical polistine wasp Mischocyttarus labiatus (Fabricius) was studied in montane rain forest at AnchicayÃ¡, Colombia. The social behavior of the species and some environmental factors that affect it were investigated. Nests of M. labiatus were founded by one or more females (foundresses). Each colony with more than two females contained one queen (primary egg-layer), one or more cofoundresses that rarely foraged and had well-developed ovaries, and one or more cofoundresses that were active foragers and showed little ovarian development. Most daughters emerging in their nests became active foragers. Males began to emerge early in the colony cycle. They remained with their natal nest throughout their lives, but mating occurred away from nests. Males flew regular patrol routes in sites away from nests.By removing specific types of females from colonies and by observing natural situations of queen and cofoundress disappearance, the flexibility of the behavioral roles of remaining females could be determined. Multifoundress group queens were capable of nesting alone, cofoundresses and daughters could become queens, nonforaging cofoundresses could become foragers, and foragers could become nonforaging cofoundresses.Nest productivity varied with foundress group size. Adult survivorship was low during the period between nest initiation and emergence of adult daughters (pre-daughter phase). Forty-four percent of queens and 40% of nonforaging cofoundresses survived, but only 27% of foragers and 20% of lone-nesting females. During the seven-week predaughter phase, nest survivorship was low (20%); over shorter periods of time it varied with foundress group size. Nest parasites (Diptera: Phoridae: Magaselia (M.) sp. near scalaria) were responsible for the greatest proportion (32%) of the failures. Many parasite attacks, particularly on multifoundress nests, were followed by brood eating, nest cutting (removing comb from petiole) and renesting by wasps.Some cofoundresses and daughters initiated their own nests following failure of the original nests. In general the success and growth rates of these nests were similar to those of other nests in the general population.

N2  - Veliger larvae of the European oyster taken seven days and 15 days after release from parent were anesthetized, fixed, critical-point dried, and examined with scanning electron microscopes. Study of body and shell in a growth series revealed many structures and patterns of development previously poorly known or unknown: (1) the presence of four ciliary bands on the velum, not three; (2) the heel-first development of the foot, with medial ciliation of the toe preceding complete ciliation; (3) the order of appearance and structure of major duct openings on the foot and body wall; (4) the beginning of larval eyes as hemispherical tufts of elongate microvilli; (5) the early development of gill primordia; and (6) the early appearance of a prominent gill bridge, which originates by cross-contact of cilia on the mantle margins followed by migration of epithelial cells and tissue fusion.A striking posterodorsal notch and growth track on the left valve of prodissoconch II of many Ostreidae and Gryphaeidae is formed by postanal cilia, which deform the fragile calcifying edge of the left valve but are unable to deform the more massive margin of the right valve.The transition from shell gland to mantle occurs very early in the prodissoconch-I stage, and increasing specialization of the mantle edge produces a three-layered shell well before the prodissoconch-I/II boundary, which merely marks the moment when the valves first completely enclose the body and close against one another. Shell microstructure does not change until metamorphosis, at which time the aragonitic microstructures disappear and are succeeded by far coarser calcitic structures. The postmetamorphic myostracum is an exception. It remains aragonitic and is possibly a continuation of the inner layer of the larval shell. The prodissoconch ligament is formed by periostracum, the fibrous resilium appearing later near the time of metamorphosis. The larval shells of oviparous and larviparous oysters differ, those of the former having a prodissoconch I that is smaller compared to prodissoconch II.

N2  - The tribe Ephydrini is represented by four genera in North America: Cirrula Cresson, Dimecoenia Cresson, Ephydra FallÃ©n, and Setacera Cresson. The adults are primarily surface skaters and have specially modified tarsi for this purpose. Most larvae have well-developed ventral prolegs and inhabit floating mats of filamentous algae. Diagnoses and generic keys are provided for the adults and third-instar larvae of North American Ephydrini.Taxonomic and biological information is presented for the Nearctic species of Cirrula (C. austrina and C. gigantea) and Dimecoenia (D. spinosa and D. fuscifemur). For each species the adults, male and female, egg, three larval instars, and puparium (except for D. fuscifemur) are described and illustrated. Keys are provided for species identification of mature larvae and adults.All four species occur only in coastal salt marsh habitats. The adults feed on microorganisms obtained from moist or wet substrates. Larvae of Cirrula inhabit mats of filamentous algae and closely resemble larvae of other Ephydrini (e. g. Ephydra) both structurally and biologically. Larvae of Dimecoenia inhabit mud substrates, and the mature larvae of one species, D. spinosa, tap the roots of aquatic macrophytic plants to obtain oxygen. The larval structure resembles that of more primitive Ephydridae, such as Scatella (Scatellini) and Parydra (Parydrinae).

The fauna at the lower elevations appears to be one generally distributed around the Caribbean Sea or even more widely throughout the lowlands of the Neotropics. However, the fauna at the higher elevations is probably rather narrowly endemic, or more rarely distributed southwardly throughout the Andes. Fifty-six species belonging to 25 genera and 9 families are reported from the basin. Of these, 31 species, 1 subspecies, and the genus Byrsopteryx are described as new. New synonymies are made in the genera Chimarra, Polycentropus, Oxyethira, and Nectopsyche. All species are keyed, discussed, and illustrated.

N2  - The state of Illinois is inhabited by 7 species of subterranean asellid isopods of the genus Caecidotea Packard. Three of these are previously known species, C. kendeighi, C. packardi, and C. stygia; 4 are described as new, C. beattyi, C. lesliei, C. meisterae, and C. whitei. Detailed accounts are given of these species and also of C. antricola, which occurs in Missouri counties adjacent to Illinois; C. tridentata, erroneously reported from Illinois; and the epigean C. spatulata, omitted from Williams' 1970 review of North American epigean species. Each account includes a full synonymy, a review of the species' published history, an illustrated description, and discussions of the habitat and geographic range. Three of the species are characterized as phreatobites, inhabitants of the upper layer of groundwater, and are recorded from drain tiles, ditches, springs, and wells. Four species are troglobites, inhabitants of the more open waters of limestone caves or springs in the Ozark Plateaus and Interior Low Plateaus provinces of western and southern Illinois.

Daily and seasonal movements of animals are emphasized and discussed in relation to foraging, reproductive activity, and territoriality. Estimates of the extent to which tigers of various sex and age classes socialize, and the circumstances under which they do so, are presented and considered with respect to factors promoting and maintaining a solitary and dispersed social system. Various aspects of the feeding ecology of tigers are detailed and incorporated into an assessment of the impact of predation on prey populations. Results from this study are then viewed in an evolutionary perspective in comparison with the lion (Panthera leo).

N2  - Since 1893, the Australian Plains-wanderer, Pedionomus torquatus, has been placed in a monotypic family and has been thought to be related to the button quails, Turnicidae, presently included in the order Gruiformes. Our examination of the osteology of Pedionomus shows that this bird is a typical member of the Charadriiformes and has no significant characters in common with the Turnicidae. The evidence used previously by Gadow (1891) to classify Pedionomus is better explained by a charadriiform origin for the genus. The diastataxic condition of the secondaries, the thigh muscle formula, the condition of the carotid arteries, the presence of the hallux, and the pyriform shape of the eggs are among the known nonosteological characters of Pedionomus that differ from the Turnicidae and that corroborate its placement in the Charadriiformes. Within the Charadriiformes, Pedionomus shares the most similarities with the South American seedsnipes of the family Thinocoridae, the next most similar group being the coursers of the family Glareolidae. Pedionomus tends to bridge the gap between the aberrant seedsnipes and the more typical Charadriiformes, although it is sufficiently distinct to merit its own family. In any sequential listing, the Pedionomidae should be placed in the order Charadriiformes, immediately preceding the Thinocoridae.

N2  - The gross anatomy of all the appendicular muscles is compared in 14 species, representing the 6 living genera of Sphenisciformes. Particular emphasis is placed on the interrelationships indicated by variations in the taxa. Eudyptes pachyrhynchus is used as a type for which all the appendicular muscles are described and most are illustrated. The salient features of other taxa, as they differ from the condition found in E. pachyrhynchus, are given. Similarities and differences are compared quantitatively in respect to 47 items in the wing and 41 in the leg, using the method of Hudson et al. (1966:9-11). The results are given in the form of cumulative scores of differences and correlation coefficients.The results of the comparison of the wing musculature support those for the leg. The cumulative scores and correlation coefficients given closely parallel results.The Sphenisciformes constitute a rather uniform group of birds. The results of this study support the present classification of the order, in which 14 species are grouped into 6 genera. A tentative phylogeny of penguins is projected on the basis of variations in the wing and leg muscles.

Two characters not previously used for adult lizardfish identification are the form of the dermal flap of the anterior nares and the peritoneal spots (previously described as pigment spots or abdominal spots from postlarvae). Description and numbers of these spots from all adult species provide an important character for identifications of larval and postlarval lizardfishes. Geographic variation in vertebral counts is discussed for S. variegatus, S. binotatus, and S. englemani. Synodus similis, previously considered a synonym of S. hoshinonis by Matsubara (1938), is shown to be a valid species. Synodus japonicus (Houttuyn) is considered a nomen dubium.

N2  - Seventeen species-level taxa are recorded from Sri Lanka, one belonging to Philanthus Fabricius (Philanthinae) and 16 to Cerceris Latreille (Cercerinae). Three taxa are known only from Sri Lanka, 12 occur also in India, and two are more widely distributed in the Oriental region. Four new species are described, C. intrusa, C. eumolpicida, C. conifera, and C. curculionicida; the first two occur also in India, and the latter two are endemic. Fourteen species are assigned to species groups already established for Palaearctic species, the triangulum group of Philanthus and the rybyensis, bupresticida, rubida, alboatra, and albofasciata groups of Cerceris. Three species are assigned to three new monotypic groups of Cerceris, conifera, curculionicida, and interstincta.Nine taxa occur in both the Dry Zone and the Wet Zone, five occur predominantly in the Dry Zone and sparingly in the Wet Zone, and three are restricted to the Wet Zone. Seven taxa are found only at low altitudes, sea level to several hundred feet, seven occur from sea level to 2200 ft, two are restricted to intermediate altitudes, 500-2100 ft, and one is found only in higher Wet Zone altitudes, 2100-6500 ft.Accounts of nesting behavior, descriptions of nests, and/or prey records are detailed for 11 taxa. The development of a buprestid clamp to assist in transporting prey is postulated for members of the bupresticida group of Cerceris.

N2  - The literature reports of Mesoplodon carlhubbsi strandings are confusing, owing to the erroneous identification of Mesoplodon species. Mesoplodon carlhubbsi is distinct from M. stejnegeri and closely related to M. bowdoini. Adult M. carlhubbsi are recognized by white (males) or light-colored (females) beaks. We report 31 strandings of this species from both the east and west coasts of the North Pacific. Scarring is very marked in older males and probably results from intraspecific aggression. Calving season is in the summer. Length at birth is about 250 cm. Both females and males reach 488-532 cm at physical maturity. Food items are fish and squid. Distribution extends from the confluence of the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents in the west to the mixed region of the California current in the east.

N2  - Dagini, new tribe, comprising the genera Diedrops Mathis and Wirth, Physemops Cresson, Dagus Cresson, and Psilephydra Hendel, is reviewed. The systematics and classification of these genera have been confused, with their placement varying from the subfamily Parydrinae to Ephydrinae. Here they are placed in Ephydrinae and are recognized as a separate tribe. The basis for this arrangement and the monophyly of the tribe are discussed. A cladogram of the tribe is proposed that elaborates relationships between genera. The phylogeny, as now conceived, is an unresolved trichotomy, with the following lineages: Diedrops, Psilephydra, and the stem lineage that gave rise to Dagus and Physemops. The latter two taxa are suggested to be sister genera. Species of the included genera are systematically reviewed, and for the genus Physemops a hypothetical phylogeny is suggested that has the genus divided into two species groups: the nemorosus group and the panops group. Character evidence for these conclusions are given. Keys to genera, species groups, and species and appropriate illustrations are provided.

The poorly known Malacanthura truncata (Hansen) and Leptanthura affinis (Bonnier) are redescribed. A brief review of the genus Malacanthura sensu stricto is provided, with a revised diagnosis. The genus Bullowanthura is recorded for the first time from the Atlantic Ocean. Aspects of the biology, including growth classes, sexual maturity, and protogyny of the only known deep sea species of Cyathura are presented. The distribution and evolution of anthurids in the deep sea and their apparent derivation from shallow-water forms, as illustrated in the genus Malacanthura, is discussed. A list of Atlantic anthurideans occurring in depths of more than 300 m is provided.

The subfamilies Canacinae and Nocticanacinae and, for Canacinae, the tribes Canacini and Dynomiellini are characterized. For the tribe Dynomiellini, the genera (Canacea Cresson; Chaetocanace Hendel; Dynomiella Soika; Isocanace, new genus; Trichocanace Wirth; Xanthocanace Hendel) are diagnosed, with catalogs and keys to included species of each. Isocanace, new genus, is revised to include four species in two species groupsâ€”the briani group: I. australis, new species (South Africa); I. briani, new name; I. flava (Canzoneri and Meneghini); and the albiceps group: I. albiceps (Malloch). Hypothetical phylogenies for the species of Isocanace and for the genera of Dynomiellini are proposed, as character evidence was discovered. Electron micrographs and line illustrations are provided for all genera, mostly of type-species.

Like most ephydrines, the immature stages of Setacera inhabit floating algal mats, primarily in fresh-water environments. A hypothetical phylogeny for the genus is proposed in which the species are arranged in five species groups. The cladistic relationships between these groups are indicated by morphological character evidence. Three new species are described: S. freidbergi (Israel and Iran), S. jamesi (coast of California, Oregon, and Washington), and S. trichoscelis (Ecuador). Four synonyms are newly proposed, all of Ephydra breviventris Loew: S. fluxa Miyagi, E. glabra Meijere, E. laeta Hendel, and S. pedalis Cresson. Keys to species groups and species, illustrations, and distribution maps are provided.

N2  - Themisto gaudichaudii, a bipolar hyperiid amphipod, was collected in discrete-depth samples taken between the surface and 1800 m in a warm core eddy as it passed through Deepwater Dumpsite 106, a site off the mouth of Delaware Bay where industrial wastes are dumped in the Atlantic Ocean. The species was most abundant in the upper strata (1-125 m) but was found in all depth intervals sampled during the day (1-25 to 1425-1800 m) and at night in depth intervals from 1-25 to 700-800 m. Night catches exceeded day catches, probably because of greater net avoidance during the day. The data do not show whether or not vertical migration occurred, probably because sampling did not partition finely enough the upper layers, where previous studies have shown that diel vertical migrations of Themisto occur. Abundance was greater in the warmest, shallow, central part of the eddy than in the deeper and peripheral parts of the eddy.

N2  - Distributional patterns, ecological data, and the systematic status of Peromyscus maniculatus, P. boylii, P. simulus, P. madrensis, P. pectoralis, P. spicilegus, and P. melanophrys are presented for the state of Nayarit, Mexico. The Peromyscus boylii species group is accorded special emphasis because of the uncertainty regarding the relationships and taxonomic level of forms included within it. On the basis of morphometric analyses of external and cranial measurements, examination of chromosomal preparations, and documentation of sympatry, madrensis, simulus, and spicilegus are considered species distinct from boylii, instead of subspecies thereof. In Nayarit, Peromyscus simulus is confined to the coastal-plain region (sea level to 100 m); Peromyscus madrensis occupies the Tres Marias Islands; Peromyscus spicilegus inhabits intermediate montane zones (100 to 1600 m) but has been found as high as 2100 m; and Peromyscus boylii occurs at high elevations (1900 to 2100 m) in the eastern mountains.

The cheilostome armature of Deontostoma coptochilus Hope, 1977; D. timmerchiorum Hope, 1974; and D. antarcticum (Linstow, 1892) Filipjev, 1916, are described and figured with scanning electron micrographs, and the homologous parts are compared among those species and with D. californicum. The stomatal armature of other taxa within Enoplida and a theory concerning their homologies and evolutionary relationships are discussed. It is postulated that members of the genus Deontostoma, and possibly other leptosomatids, are mucus trap feeders. Thoracostoma zeae Inglis, 1964, is transferred to the genus Deontostoma.

Currently, little is known of the relationship between social and physical maturation in this species.From February 1974 to January 1976, quantitative data were collected on the maturation of seven litters of lion tamarins (Leontopithecus rosalia rosalia) born at the National Zoological Park, Washington, D.C. Although a total of 22 tamarins were involved in the observations, the study focused on the ontogeny of eight males and six females in the first year of life.Five maturational phases were distinguished: (1) Dependent Infant, (2) Advanced Infant, (3) Young Juvenile, (4) Advanced Juvenile, and (5) Young Subadult. Data were taken for six behavior categories: (1) infant carrying, (2) food sharing and stealing, (3) allogrooming, (4) scent marking and social sniffing, (5) sexual behavior, and (6) agonistic behavior. The data were examined for the first appearance of these behaviors and for the influence of three variables on maturing young: (1) parental reproduction, (2) the presence of older and younger siblings in the family group, and (3) the existence of same and opposite sex biases in social interactions within the family unit.Infants were carried to 14 weeks after birth. Mothers were the principal carriers in the first three weeks, after which fathers dominated carrying; older siblings were involved to a limited extent.Both food sharing and stealing were observed between individuals of both sexes and of various ages. Mothers in late pregnancy and immediately postpartum received food from older young as did both parents when carrying newborn infants. Older young and parents provided food for new infants, especially during weaning.Same sex preferences occurred regularly in social interactions between young and other family members. Some opposite sex biases became evident in weeks 41-52, the Young Subadult Phase, when physical size and scent marking rates began to approach adult levels. Several 41 to 52-week-old males attempted to mount their mothers and one subadult female was repeatedly mounted by her father. However, intromission was never observed except between parental pairs.Noninjurious agonistic encounters between (1) young subadults and same sex parents and (2) between subadults and siblings were seen to increase towards the end of the first year, yet older offspring are known to remain in relative harmony within the family unit up to 20 months of age. The extended residence of older young in the family group is believed to maximize the chances of survival and reproductive success of parents and infants, and also provides older offspring with the training necessary to maximize their own reproductive success once they have left the natal family unit. Supporting this conclusion was the finding that primiparous parents having the most experience interacting with younger siblings had the most success in rearing their own infants.

Three new species, R. hudsoni, R. menziesi, and R. homocuspidatus, are described, based on material formerly identified as R. epistomus and R. variatus. Only two of the species have been isolated in the western Atlantic Ocean, whereas the remaining 13 species are confined to the eastern Pacific Ocean. Analysis of evolutionary deployment indicates that the Atlantic species are derived from Pacific species.

N2  - A supplementary description of Philomedes brenda (Baird, 1850), the type-species of Philomedes, is given based on specimens from Norway, Greenland, and the northwest Atlantic. The findings are compatible with the conclusions of others that the species is amphiatlantic in distribution. Its southernmost distribution in the western Atlantic is about 44Â°N, and in the eastern Atlantic in the vicinity of England about 54Â°N, possibly 50Â°N. The species appears to be the only circumpolar member of the superfamily Cypridinacea, but may not be present in the deeper waters of the Arctic Ocean. Philomedes albatross, a new species previously referred to P. brenda, from the northwest Atlantic is described and illustrated.

N2  - About 1300 samples of Hyperiidae from almost all parts of the Indian Ocean, collected by vertical tows from a depth of 200 m to the surface, were examined. Fifteen species, including 8 not previously known from the Indian Ocean, were identified and enumerated, and their distributions mapped. Most species were more or less randomly scattered over the entire Indian Ocean. Themisto gaudichaudii was confined to cool water, mostly south of 30Â°S, but penetrated farther north to the west of Australia. The most abundant and widespread species were Hyperioides sibaginis and Lestrigonus schizogeneios, each of which occurred at more than one-half of all the stations; together they made up 41 percent of the total number of specimens of Hyperiidae. There were no apparent differences in numbers of specimens between day and night samples. Nine species occurred more frequently in the Arabian Sea during the NE monsoon than during the SW monsoon. It is suggested that the swifter anticyclonic gyre of the SW monsoon causes greater spatial separation. Species confined to definite biotic provinces in the Pacific Ocean show no provincialism in the Indian Ocean, and physiological races may have evolved in the 2 oceans.

The Haustorioidea are reorganized by rejection of the Pontoporeiidae and the description of new families Urohaustoriidae, Zobrachoidae, and Condukiidae; the Haustoriidae, Phoxocephalidae, and Platyischnopidae are rediagnosed to fit this haustorioid pattern. The described species of Urohaustorius are clarified (9 new species) and the new genera Gheegerus (1 new species), Narunius (1), Tuldarus (2), Tottungus (1) and Dirimus (1), with affinities to Urohausiorius, are established. The Zobrachoidae are established to contain Zobracho and the new genera Bumeralius (1) and Prantinus (1). The new genus Condukius (1) is assigned to a new family of its own. The Urothoidae are defined to include Urothoe, Urothoides, Carangolia, and Cunicus.

Pseudopalaemon amazonensis, previously known only from a brief summary description, is fully described and figured. A key to the five species of Pseudopalaemon is given. Some basic ecological and biological data of the species are included, which are related especially to the black and clear waters of the Rio Negro basin. The role of the shrimps in the submerged leaf litter habitat of the inundated forests is briefly discussed. Examination of stomach contents indicates the predatory scavenging habits of several of the shrimp species.

N2  - Collections made by members of the Smithsonian Institution scientific staff and collaborating investigators from other institutions produced 2029 specimens of porcellanid crabs over a nine-year period from November 1966 to January 1976. Specimens were obtained along the Pacific coastline from Sonora, Mexico to the Republic of Panama, including offshore islands in the Bay of Panama. Other specimens were collected at onshore and island sites along the Caribbean coastline of Panama, as well as in the locks at both ends of the Panama Canal. Specimens belonging to 50 species of seven genera were obtained, and several interesting range extensions or records were noted for the Republic of Panama and the Pacific coast of Mexico. The present collections, added to data obtained earlier, show that the waters in and adjacent to the Republic of Panama support 64 species in 12 genera; 24 species (including five or six trans-Panamanian conspecifics) occur in Caribbean waters, and 45 are found on the Pacific side of the isthmus. The Panamanian procellanids thus comprise nearly 70% of all the species in this family recorded from both the eastern Pacific and Caribbean faunal provinces.

N2  - The genus Atya, as characterized in this study, comprises an assemblage of 11 tropical freshwater species ranging through the Antilles and along the Atlantic and Pacific versants of Middle and South America and in western Africa. The literature related to these shrimps is reviewed, and the taxonomic characters are discussed. Correlations of carapace length and total length are presented, and ecological and life history data reviewed. A discussion of relationships and dispersal is followed by a definition of the genus, its range, and a key to the species. For each of the latter, a complete synonomy, a review of the literature, a summary of available illustrations, a diagnosis, an illustrated description, the range, a list of localities and the specimens examined, observed variations, its ecological distribution, and life history notes are provided. Atya brachyrhinus, known to occur in only a single cave on Barbados, West Indies, is the only new taxon introduced. Four species are largely restricted to the Pacific slope of the Americas: Atya crassa, A. dressleri, A. margaritacea, and A. ortmannioides; two are confined to the Antilles: A. brachyrhinus and A. lanipes; two to Africa: A. africana and A. intermedia. Two species occur in the Atlantic versant of both continents: A. gabonensis and A. scabra; and only one, A. innocous, is widespread on both slopes of Middle America, although A. crassa and A. scabra are known to occur in a few localities on the Atlantic and Pacific slopes, respectively.

N2  - In the past decade, fossil deposits from five of the main Hawaiian Islands have yielded thousands of bones of extinct and living species of birds. Through these specimens, the number of endemic species of land birds in the avifauna of the main islands has been more than doubled. There are 40 extinct species known only from bones, including 1 petrel (Procellariidae), 2 ibises (Plataleidae), 7 geese (Anatidae), 1 small hawk and 1 eagle (Accipitridae), 7 rails (Rallidae), 3 species of a new genus of owl (Strigidae), 2 large crows (Corvidae), 1 honeyeater (Meliphagidae), and at least 15 species of Hawaiian finches (Fringillidae, Drepanidini). The present report discusses the fossil deposits and the physical and biological features of the islands in order to provide background information for our future systematic publications on the fossil and modern avifauna of the Hawaiian Islands. An informal listing of the species found as fossils permits preliminary analyses of extinction and biogeography. The major fossil localities are on the islands of Kauai, Oahu, and Molokai, from each of which there are diverse collections of small passerines, as well as many specimens of nonpasserine land birds, shorebirds, and seabirds. Fossils of a few additional extinct species have been found incidentally on Maui and Hawaii. Bones of extinct birds have been found in situations as diverse as sand dunes, sinkholes, and a flooded cavern in a raised coral reef, lava tubes, loess deposits, an ash deposit under a lava flow, and in archeological sites. Although some of the fossil deposits may be from the late Pleistocene epoch, most of the more important ones are probably Holocene, ranging from about 6700 years B.P. to much younger. Evidence is presented to show that the extinct species of birds survived into the period of Polynesian colonization. We believe that the extinction of half or more of the land birds of the Hawaiian Islands prior to European discovery resulted mainly from the destruction of lowland forest by Polynesians, augmented by predation by man and introduced mammals. This has altered the distribution of species within the archipelago as well as the species composition of individual islands in such a drastic manner as to suggest that the data used in traditional and modern ecological studies of island biogeography may be too incomplete to permit generalizations about any islands that were settled by prehistoric man.

N2  - The order Passeriformes is divided into two major groups: the oscines (Suborder Passeres), characterized by a derived condition of the syrinx, and the suboscines (Suborder Tyranni), characterized by a derived condition of the stapes. The only passerines yet identified that lack both the derived stapes and a fully oscine syrinx are the Australian lyrebirds (Menuridae) and scrub-birds (Atrichornithidae) of the suborder "Menurae," and the New Zealand "wrens" (Acanthisittidae). We document the first reported occurrence of a primitive stapes in an otherwise suboscine groupâ€”the genus Melanopareia of the South American family Rhinocryptidae. Our comparisons show that the osteology of the Menurae is utterly unlike that of the oscine families Ptilonorhynchidae or Paradisaeidae, to which the Menurae have recently been postulated to be related, whereas we show that many of their osteological peculiarities are shared only with the Rhinocryptidae. Although the Menurae may be the most primitive members of the suborder Passeres and the Rhinocryptidae are almost certainly the most primitive members of the superfamily Furnarioidea, they are nevertheless more similar to each other osteologically than either is to some other passerine group. We suggest that the Menurae and the Rhinocryptidae are among the most primitive of the Passeriformes and are representative of the ancestral stock that gave rise to the remainder of the passerines. The evidence suggests that the order Passeriformes is at least as old as most other modern orders of birds and probably arose in the Southern Hemisphere. In an appendix we show that the grallarine section of the Formicariidae exhibits some of the osteological traits of the Rhinocryptidae and it is suggested that the sequence of families in the superfamily Furnarioidea should be: Rhinocryptidaeâ€”Formicariidaeâ€”Furnariidae (including Dendrocolaptidae).

N2  - It is the thesis of this study that the Pacific lithospheric plate (Pacific Plate) forms a major subunit of the Indo-Pacific biogeographic region. This thesis is defended on two primary grounds: the sharp decrease in numbers of taxa as one proceeds eastward across the western margin of the Pacific Plate, and the presence of a high degree of endemism on the Plate. The complex geotectonic history of the Plate and adjacent plate margins is discussed and the vicariance scenarios that produced the three main types of endemism (widely distributed Plate endemism, endemism restricted to a limited region on the Plate, and endemism restricted to single islands or island groups) are hypothesized.Anecdotal discussions of the distributions of 179 shorefish family groups are presented, as well as discussions of the distributions of selected terrestrial and marine taxa of other organisms. Particular attention is given to presumed erroneous or exceptional distributions of fishes on the Pacific Plate, including, but not limited to, north-south disjunct distributions, Hawaiian Islands' exceptional distributions, and distributions involving the Caroline Islands, which serve as stepping stones for dispersal onto the Pacific Plate.

N2  - This study is a comparative treatment of the behavior and environmental adaptations of two species of carpenter bees, Xylocopa sulcatipes Maa and X. pubescens Spinola, in Israel. Xylocopa sulcatipes is a cane and thin-branch nester and constructs a simple linear nest. Xylocopa pubescens makes ramified nests within various wooden substrates. Both species have 3-4 generations per year, from March to September. The females guard their nests against intruders, especially conspecifics. Both species may develop along a solitary pathway, with one female per nest. Additionally, X. pubescens may have a foraging mother cohabiting with her nonovipositing daughters, in contrast to X. sulcatipes, which may have more than one foraging and ovipositing female in the same nest. In both species, the incoming mother feeds her progeny by trophallaxis. Males of both species are territorial; territories of X. sulcatipes are conducted in locations where females may occur, whereas those of X. pubescens are in prominent places like flowering shrubs, tree tops, etc. The flower-visiting repertoire of X. sulcatipes and X. pubescens is extensive and overlapping; however, due to its ability to fly at earlier hours, X. pubescens gets to most of the flowers before X. sulcatipes. Both species are endothermic; the lower activity threshold for X. sulcatipes is 21Â°C and that of X. pubescens is 18Â°C. Consequently, the flight hours of the former start later than those of the latter. The duration of the their outdoor activity also differs, with the former being active most of the day and the latter confining its flight hours to the early morning when the total heat load of the environment is low. The ontogenesis of the bees is described, and their few natural enemies are discussed.

N2  - Three species formerly in Paraphoxus (major, similis, and cognatus) are transferred into Foxiphalus for the first time and redescribed in expanded format. From materials of previously described species (Paraphoxus obtusidens, type-species of Foxiphalus; P. major; P. similis; P. cognatus; and Eobrolgus spinosus), the following new species are described: Foxiphalus xiximeus, F. aleuti, F. secasius, F. apache, and F. golfensis. This completes the revision of old collections, and a new key to certain American genera of Phoxocephalidae is presented as well as a key to the species of Foxiphalus and Eobrolgus.

N2  - The curimatid characoid genus Curimatopsis is redefined to form a monophyletic assemblage. Four species are recognized in the genus: Curimatopsis macrolepis (Steindachner, 1876), C. microlepis Eigenmann and Eigenmann, 1889, C. evelynae GÃ©ry, 1964, and C. crypticus, new species. These species share a number of derived osteological characters and form the sister group to all other members of the family. Synapomorphies unique to Curimatopsis among curimatids are (a) pronounced sexual dimorphism in caudal peduncle depth with associated modifications in caudal osteology, (b) morphology of the suspensorium, in particular the metapterygoid-quadrate fenestra, and (c) certain modifications of the dermal bones, particularly the absence of any discrete antorbital ossification.Curimatichthys, created by Fernandez-Yepez (1948) for C. microlepsis, is placed into the synonymy of Curimatopsis. Curimatopsis macrocephalus Ahl, 1931, is considered a junior synomym of C. macrolepis (Steindachner). Curimatopsis maculatus Ahl, 1934, and C. saladensis Meinken, 1933, are more closely related to curimatids outside of Curimatopsis and are excluded from the genus. The two species of Hemicurimata considered by Fernandez-Yepez to form the group most closely related to Curimatopsis were found to be based on juveniles of Psectrogaster amazonica Eigenmann and Eigenmann and Curimata spilura Gunther. Each of the latter species in turn is more closely related to curimatid species outside of Curimatopsis.

N2  - Forty-six species are recorded from Sri Lanka in the following subfamilies: Anthoboscinae with one species of Anthobosca GuÃ©rin; Tiphiinae with 30 species of Tiphia Fabricius; Myzininae with five species of Mesa Saussure and two of Hylomesa Krombein; Methochinae with three species of Methocha subgenus Methocha Latreille, four species of Methocha subgenus Dryinopsis Brues, and one species of Karlissa Krombein. Thirty-seven species are known from both sexes, and nine from only one sex. Thirty-one species occur only in Sri Lanka, and 15 are found also in India or are more widely distributed in the Oriental Region. Specific hosts are unknown, but it is presumed that all taxa are parasitic on coleopterous larvae in the soil, in rotting wood, or in cavities in twigs or sound dead timber.The 33 new taxa are Anthobosca ceylonica, Tiphia leclercqi, T. kaszabi, T. sakagamii, T. knutsoni, T. hillyardi, T. bouceki, T. moczari, T. tsunekii, T. gurneyi, T. kurczewskii, T. bakeriana, T. weismani, T. pulawskii, T. wittmeri, T. wirthi, T. carvalhoi, T. vanlithi, T. hirashimai, T. dayi, T. fennahi, T. wahisi, T. sabroskyi, Mesa karunaratnei, M. flavipennis, Hylomesa anomala, Methocha (Methocha) litoralis, M.

N2  - The known American taxa of this family are divided into genera to complement the oriental taxa. Several unsolved problems remain. The taxa are Eudevenopus (new), with type-species Platyischnopus metagracilis J.L. Barnard, and including newly reanalyzed Platyischnopus gracilipes Schellenberg, Phoxocephalus capuciatus Oliveira (obscure), and a new species, E. honduranus (these three may be synonymous); Tiburonella (new), with type-species Platyischnopus viscana J.L. Barnard; and Skaptopus (new), with type-species S. brychius (new).These species are widespread through the Americas. Skaptopus is a deepwater taxon in depths of 100+ m whereas the other taxa occur in shallow water. They all have a plough-shaped head and are assumed to be fossorial.

N2  - One hundred ten new species and one new genus of caddisflies from southern South America are described and figured. The region covered includes all of Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, as well as Brazil from the state of Santa Catarina south. The faunal divisions of Argentina, based on the evidence of the Trichoptera, are defined. A key to all the known families of South American Trichoptera is presented. The new genus Ascotrichia is proposed with type-species A. frontalis, new species, and is placed in the family Hydroptilidae, tribe Leucotrichiini; to this genus is transferred Betrichia surinamensis Flint (new combination). The genus Banyallarga NavÃ¡s, type-species B. testacea NavÃ¡s, is recognized in the Calamoceratidae, and Loxinum NavÃ¡s, type-species L. aequatorium NavÃ¡s, is synonymized with it (new synonymy). Hydropsyche vicaria Walker, Ganonema molliculum McLachlan, Phylloicus loxanus NavÃ¡s, Anisocentropus columbianus NavÃ¡s, A. villosus NavÃ¡s, and Loxinum aequatorium NavÃ¡s are all transferred to Banyallarga (all new combinations). Banyallarga crenata NavÃ¡s is transferred to Phylloicus MÃ¼ller (new combination).

N2  - A series of osteological and soft anatomical systems in the families Curimatidae, Prochilodontidae, Anostomidae, and Chilodontidae were examined to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of these taxa and determine whether they are a monophyletic assemblage. Numerous adaptations associated with the food gathering and manipulation systems along with those in other portions of the body provided data useful in the reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships of these taxa. The evidence of this study is congruent with the hypothesis that the four families constitute a monophyletic assemblage definable by shared derived characters. Results of the analysis indicate that the Curimatidae and Prochilodontidae are most parsimoniously interpreted to be sister groups. The assemblage formed by those two families is considered to be the sister group of the monophyletic lineage that consists of the Anostomidae and Chilodontidae. Synapomorphies define the members of each family as monophyletic units.The well-developed epibranchial organs in the Chilodontidae, Citharinidae, and the Curimatidae plus Prochilodontidae, were found to represent three distinct, nonhomologous kinds of pharyngeal outpocketings. The most parsimonious interpretation of those data and other available information on ostariophysan phylogeny is that such diverticuli have been acquired several times independently among characiforms and their near relatives. This conclusion agrees with the hypothesis proposed by Nelson (1967) but indicates that Bertmar, Kapoor, and Miller's concept (1969) of epibranchial organs as the ancestral condition for teleosts is not parsimonious, at least when applied to ostariophysan fishes.

N2  - Nine subgenera of Eustomias are recognized tentatively and diagnostic characters are given for each. Nominostomias is redefined and restricted to species having 3 pectoral rays, a slender barbel stem without branches and with little or no external pigment or row of dark spots, 1 or 2 terminal bulbs, no wide ventral body groove posterior to the pectoral-fin bases, high numbers of serial photophores and vertebrae (69-80 IC, 63-73 vertebrae), and no paired photophores in the lateral series.Thirty-eight species of Nominostomias are recognized, primarily on the basis of barbel structure. A key and tables of diagnostic characters for all species supplement descriptions, synonymies, graphs of barbel and postorbital-organ dimensions, and illustrations of barbels. Eight currently accepted species are recognized: E. longibarba, bibulbosus, melanostigma, patulus, bulbornatus, gibbsi, vitiazi, and multifilis. Five species are resurrected from synonymy: E. micraster, arborifer, bituberatus, bimargaritatus, and melanonema. Twenty-five species are described as new: E. austratlanticus, bibulboides, orientalis, australensis, bituberoides, inconstans, appositus, deofamiliaris, grandibulbus, crossotus, bimargaritoides, melanostigmoides, medusa, bertelseni, suluensis, posti, kreffti, teuthidopsis, cirritus, cancriensis, pacificus, spherulifer, curtatus, perplexus, and mesostenus.Thirteen species of Nominostomias occur only in the Atlantic, 3 only in the Indian Ocean, 1 only in the Sulu Sea, and 17 only in the Pacific. One species is found in the Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific and 3 in both the Indian and Pacific oceans. There are no bipolar subtropical species in the Atlantic, perhaps 3 in the Pacific. The paucity of species known from more than 1 ocean and the rarity of overlap in species ranges are noteworthy.

N2  - The shrimps recognized in this study comprise six freshwater species that have often been referred, untenably and sometimes in synonymy, to the genus Atya. Three of the species are here assigned to the reestablished genus Atyoida: A. bisulcata, confined to Hawaii; A. pilipes, ranging eastward from eastern Indonesia and the Philippines to the Marquesas and Gambier islands; and A. serrata, possibly limited to Madagascar and smaller islands in the tropical western Indian Ocean. Two closely related forms compose the new genus Atyopsis: A. moluccensis, ranging through Thailand and Malaya to Indonesia and perhaps westward to Sri Lanka and northeastward to the Philippines; and A. spinipes, apparently inhabiting the eastern Lesser Sunda Islands and extending northward through the Philippines to Okinawa and eastward as far as Samoa. Atya striolata, occupying streams along the east coast of Australia, is assigned to the new genus Australatya. Keys are provided to the genera and species and, for each of the latter, there are a complete synonymy, review of the literature, references to published illustrations, a diagnosis, color notes if available, size limits, the known range and material examined, variations observed, ecological information, life-history notes if any, common names, and economic importance. Special attention is paid to the heteromorphism of the chelipeds in Atyoida, especially as displayed by a series of several hundred specimens of A. pilipes from Palau, Caroline Islands.

N2  - All muscles of the axial and appendicular skeleton of Eulampis jugularis are described and illustrated, and comparisons are made with the Rufous-breasted Hermit (Glaucis hirsuta), the Fork-tailed Woodnymph (Thalurania furcata), the Velvet-browed Brilliant (Heliodoxa xanthogonys), the Giant Hummingbird (Patagona gigas), the Tyrian Metaltail (Metallura tyrianthina), and the Bahama Woodstar (Calliphlox evelynae). These species were chosen to include the major taxonomic subdivisions within the Trochilidae. Although species with remarkable structural modifications of the bill, wings, and tail are excluded from this study, myological variation within the hummingbirds studied nevertheless suggests considerable potential for future studies of systematics and adaptation within the Trochilidae. Unusual features in hummingbirds are identified and compared with oscines (Passeriformes), swifts, and various other birds for future use in phylogenetic studies on the familial and ordinal levels. Hummingbirds are shown to lack 19 muscles or distinct parts of muscles found in some members of the Passeriformes.

Notes are presented insofar as possible on nest construction and architecture, selection and storage of prey, life history, male activity, and associated commensals, predators, and parasites.Ammophila laevigata Smith stores up to three paralyzed caterpillars per cell for its larva. The prey belong to the Satyridae and Noctuidae.Ammophila atripes Smith stores a single larger noctuid caterpillar, perhaps that of a cutworm. Sometimes the female acts as a brigand, digging up the caterpillar stored by another female, destroying the egg of that wasp, then reburying the caterpillar in the original nest and laying her own egg upon it.Sphex obscurus (Fabricius) preys only upon nymphal or adult tettigoniid grasshoppers belonging to the genus Conocephalus, practices mass provisioning, and provides 4-6 prey per nest.Sphex sericeus fabricii Dahlbom also practices mass provisioning; it was observed to have provided four prey in one completed nest. It was unique in that one female made an empty accessory burrow adjacent to the true nest as has been reported for another subspecies of S. sericeus (Fabricius). Most Ceylonese prey records are of Gryllacrididae as in several other subspecies of S. sericeus, but a few Ceylonese females provided Gryllidae or Tettigoniidae.Sphex subtruncatus krombeini Vecht is a new taxon described by him in the appendix. It differs biologically from the other observed Ceylonese Sphex in that it practices progressive provisioning, that is, the egg is placed on the first prey specimen and additional prey are provided daily after the egg hatches. This wasp preys predominantly upon a wide variety of tettigoniid grasshoppers.

N2  - Nine species are recorded from Sri Lanka, two belonging to Stizus Latreille and seven to Bembecinus Costa. One species of Stizus is widespread in the Oriental Region, the other occurs in the Indian subcontinent, Iran, and Mauritius; four species of Bembecinus are found both in Sri Lanka and India, and three species of Bembecinus apparently occur only in Sri Lanka. The following new species are described: B. luteolus and B. knighti from Sri Lanka, and B. krameri and B. broomfieldi from Sri Lanka and South India. Lectotypes are designated for B. pusillus (Handlirsch) and B. proximus (Handlirsch). No new synonymy is proposed.The species of Bembecinus usually make unicellular nests, preferably in friable soil, and provision progressively with a wide variety of homopterous prey. Nesting, prey records, and natural enemies are discussed insofar as known for B. comberi (Turner), B. luteolus, B. pusillus, and B. proximus.

N2  - Tyson belos is described, based on specimens from the Great Barrier Reef, Trobriand Islands, and Lau Islands. This diminutive (gravid female 18.8 mm SL), coral-reef species differs conspicuously from all other gobioids in having the following combination of characters: pelvic fins separate, each comprising a single segmented ray and no spine; teeth on vomer; anterior (spinous) dorsal fin lacking. Tyson appears to be closely related to Xenisthmus Snyder, Allomicrodesmus Schultz, and an undescribed genus (and species, reference D.F. Hoese). These genera share at least one synapomorphy within the Gobioidei: ventral lip with free ventral margin extending across dentary symphysis (margin interrupted across symphysis in other gobioids). The subfamily Xenisthminae is recognized on this single character. There are, however, osteological specializations that are known only for Tyson and Xenisthmus and that are predicted to occur in the other two xenisthmine genera: premaxillary ascending process greatly reduced or absent (if present, lower than anterior maxillary articulating process of premaxilla); ascending processes replaced in position and function by a rostral bone (ossified rostral cartilage); basibranchials 2 to 4 absent. A rostral bone occurs in a few other gobioid genera, but in these the ascending premaxillary processes are well developed, basibranchials 2 to 4 are present, and not all the species in each genus where the rostral bone occurs have a rostral bone, indicating the probability that this bone is a homoplasy in those non-xenisthmine genera where it occurs.The osteologies of Tyson and Xenisthmus are described and illustrated. Synapomorphies are provided for the Gobioidei, Rhyacichthyidae, and Gobiidae, and the Rhyacichthyidae is proposed as the sister-group of all other gobioids.

N2  - Systematic characters separating Styraconyx Thulin, 1942, from the closely related genera Bathyechiniscus Steiner, 1926, and Pleocola CantacuzÃ¨ne, 1951, are presented. Descriptions of Styraconyx haploceros Thulin, 1942, S. sargassi Thulin, 1942, S. hallasi Kristensen, 1977, and S. craticulus (Pollock, 1983), new combination (formerly Bathyechiniscus craticulus), are emended based on a reexamination of type material. New records of S. craticulus and S. kristenseni Renaud-Mornant, 1981(b) from Al-Ghardaqa (Red Sea), the East Coast of Australia, the Coral Sea, and New Zealand indicate that these species are sympatric sibling species. Styraconyx paulae Robotti, 1971, is removed from synonomy with Bathyechiniscus tetronyx. Two new species, Styraconyx nanoqsunguak and S. qivitoq, are described from Disko Bay, West Greenland. Seminal receptacles, segmental glands, and secondary clavae are described for the first time in this genus. Postembryonic development in the two new species indicate that there are at least four instars before female maturation. The presence of both a neotenic dwarf male and a normal-size male, especially in S. qivitoq but also in S. nanoqsunguak, suggests that this species-group has a life cycle similar to that recently found in Tetrakentron. Evaluation of the variability of morphological features used as taxonomic characters is given, in addition to general comments on the distribution, ecology, and phylogeny of the members of this genus.

N2  - Although the maned wolf is prized by zoological gardens and is considered endangered throughout its range, little is known of the ecology and social behavior of the species. This monograph presents the results of a 2-year field study conducted in the Serra de Canastra National Park, Brazil, and of a 15-month behavioral study of maned wolves captive at the Conservation and Research Center of the National Zoological Park, Front Royal, Virginia, USA.Results of the field study are based on radiotelemetric and visual observation of 11 individuals living in four discrete home ranges. Wolves are largely nocturnal, with the majority of circadian activity occurring from dusk to midnight. Males are active more often than females, and pair-members are usually found in close association only during the breeding season. Solanum lycocarpum, small mammals and miscellaneous fruits are the most important dietary components, as determined by examination of feces. Consumption of these food items is consistent with seasonal availability indicating that maned wolves are trophic generalists. Males and females are monogamous and share territories averaging 27 square kilometers. Vacancies created by the deaths of resident wolves are filled presumably by unlanded loners. The greatest source of recorded mortality was due to reprisals by ranchers for wolf depredation on domestic fowl. Six of eight wolves tested positive for cystinuria, a metabolic disease occasionally fatal in captivity.Behavioral observations on eight captive pairs of maned wolves were conducted during two breeding seasons. Males scent mark, vocalize, and initiate activity more often than do females, suggesting a more prominent role by males in territorial defense. Anestrus is characterized by mutual avoidance and minimum levels of scent marking and vocalization. Proestrus is a period of social approximation culminating in estrus. Distance-decreasing behavior drops to a minimum during gestation. However, the continued high level of mutual use of space suggests that females regulate the extent to which males participate in parental care.

T1  - A Functional and Evolutionary Analysis of Rhynchokinesis in Birds

N2  - In this paper avian cranial kinesis is analysed in terms of the configuration of bony hinges found in the upper jaw. Three basic forms of kinesis are recognized: prokinesis, amphikinesis, and rhynchokinesis; rhynchokinesis is subdivided into double, distal, proximal, central, and extensive rhynchokinesis. Schizorhiny is discussed and is regarded as a partial synonym of rhynchokinesis. In distally rhynchokinetic birds, neither the term "holorhinal" nor "schizorhinal" is applicable.In schizorhinal birds and most rhynchokinetic birds the presence of two hinge axes at the base of the upper jaw imposes a requirement of bending within the jaw during kinesis. Bending takes different forms according to the number of hinges and their geometric configuration within the upper jaw. Proximal rhynchokinesis and distal rhynchokinesis apparently evolved from double rhynchokinesis by loss of different hinges. Extensive rhynchokinesis is an unusual and probably specialized variant. Kinesis in hummingbirds is still little understood.Downbending of the symphysis of the upper jaw during retraction is a property of amphikinesis and of double and distal rhynchokinesis, and is judged to play an important role in grasping prey, particularly in slender-billed birds that probe. The adaptive significance of rhynchokinesis in certain non-probing birds is not yet known. It is hypothesized that the schizorhinal skull in proximally rhynchokinetic birds reflects ancestry, but has no adaptive explanation, in many living species.Either prokinesis or some form of rhynchokinesis could be primitive for birds. Rhynchokinesis is not compatible with the presence of teeth in the bending zone of the ventral bar of the upper jaw, and it probably evolved after their loss. Neognathous rhynchokinesis, however, probably evolved from prokinesis. The evolutionary origin of rhynchokinesis from prokinesis required selection for morphological changes that produced two hinge axes at the base of the upper jaw. Once evolved, the properties of these axes were subject to selection in relation to their effects on kinesis. The various forms of kinesis are hypothesized to have evolved by simple steps, and pathways to each kind of kinesis are suggested. In neognathous birds, prokinesis was probably ancestral to amphikinesis, and amphikinesis to rhynchokinesis in most cases, but prokinesis has also evolved secondarily from proximal rhynchokinesis. Rhynchokinesis in paleognathous birds differs from neognathous rhynchokinesis, and it probably evolved by a different pathway.The use of simple models is valuable in formulating hypotheses about the functional properties and evolutionary history of different forms of kinesis. The functional analysis of kinesis provides a rationale for adaptive radiation and convergence in avian orders that include rhynchokinetic members, and suggests polarities and evolutionary directions that may be useful in phylogenetic analysis.

N2  - The North American species of the genus Brachycentrus are revised on the basis of adult males and larvae. The genera Eobrachycentrus, Adicrophleps, Amiocentrus, Micrasema, and Brachycentrus are the recognized world genera of the family. Their relationships are discussed and a phylogeny proposed. In Brachycentrus, five subgenera (Brachycentrus, Oligoplectrum, Sychnothrix, Oligoplectrodes, and Sphinctogaster) are recognized, defined, and their phylogeny proposed. In North America, Brachycentrus sensu strictu contains only B. nigrosoma (Banks) (with new synonyms B. notabulus Milne and B. adelus Ross). Oligoplectrum is lacking in North America, but widespread in Europe. The new subgenus, Sychnothrix, is established for Oligoplectrum echo Ross, its only included species. Oligoplectrodes contains only B. americanus (Banks) in North America. The remaining ten recognized species are placed in Sphinctogaster (with new synonym Brachycentriella Iwata): B. appalachia new species, B. chelatus Ross, B. etowahensis Wallace, B. fuliginosus Walker, B. incanus Hagen, B. lateralis (Say), B. numerosus (Say), B. occidentalis Banks, B. solomoni new species, and B. spinae Ross. The North American subgenera and species (males and larvae) are keyed, described and illustrated with distribution maps provided for the species.

N2  - The previously monotypic curimatid characiform genus Potamorhina is redefined as a multispecific, monophyletic subunit of the Curimatidae. Five species are recognized. Potamorhina pristigaster (Steindachner, 1876) and the following new combinations: P. laticeps (Valenciennes, 1849), P. altamazonica (Cope, 1878), P. latior (Spix, 1829), and P. squamoralevis (Bragg and Azpelicueta, 1983).A variety of synapomorphies in the gill arches, sixth infraorbital, and other morphological systems define the genus Potamorhina as a monophyletic subunit of the family. Derived modifications of the gasbladder, vertebral column, and the third unbranched ray of the lower lobe of the caudal fin unite groups within the genus.Potamorhina altamazonica, considered a synonym of P. laticeps by Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) and subsequent authors, is shown to be a distinct species that inhabits the Rio Amazonas and RÃ­o Orinoco systems. Potamorhina laticeps is endemic to the Lago Maracaibo drainage basin of Venezuela. The numerous literature citations of P. laticeps from other river systems of South America were based on misidentifications, primarily of P. altamazonica and to a lesser extent of P. latior and P. squamoralevis. Records of P. latior and P. laticeps from the La Plata drainage system and Eigenmann and Ogle's report (1907) of Psectrogaster curviventris from that river basin were found to be based on misidentifications of Potamorhina squamoralevis.Semitapicis, which previously included the majority of the species incorporated into Potamorhina in the present study, was found to be unavailable for the species of that assemblage. The type-species of Semitapicis (Charax planirostris of Gray, 1854) is evidently a synonym of Curimata cyprinoides or a closely related species. The C. cyprinoides assemblage and Potamorhina (sensu lato) do not constitute a monophyletic lineage. Gasterotomus Eigenmann (1910) and Suprasinelepichthys Fernandez-Yepez (1948) are placed into the synonymy of Potamorhina, and Gasterostomus Fernandez Yepez (1948) is considered to be an incorrect spelling of Gasterotomus Eigenmann.O gÃªnero Potamorhina da famÃ­lia Curimatidae, anteriormente considerado monotÃ­pico, Ã© redifinido e expandido. Cinco espÃ©cies sÃ£o reconhecidas: Potamorhina latior (Spix, 1829), P. laticeps (Valenciennes, 1849), P. pristigaster (Steindachner, 1876), P. altamazonica (Cope, 1878), P. squamoralevis (Braga e Azpelicueta, 1983). Uma variedade de caracteres derivados em comum relativos a arcos branquiais, sistema lÃ¡tero-sensorial do sexto infra-orbital e dados merÃ­sticos, define o gÃªnero como uma sub-unidade monofilÃ©tica de Curimatidae e une as sub-unidades do gÃªnero.Potamorhina altamazonica foi considerada um sinÃ´nimo de P. laticeps por Eigenmann e Eigenmann (1889) e esta atitude foi seguida por todos os autores subsequentes. Pesquisas posteriores revelaram que P. altamazonica Ã© uma espÃ©cie distinta, amplamente distribuida nas bacias do Rio Amazonas e do Rio Orinoco. Potamorhina laticeps Ã©, na verdade, endÃªmica Ã  bacia do Lago Maracaibo. As numerosas citaÃ§Ãµes da literatura referentes a P. laticeps das bacias do Rio Amazonas e do Rio Paraguai basearam-se em identificaÃ§Ãµes errÃ´neas de P. altamazonica, P. latior e P. squamoralevis. Potamorhina latior e P. pristigaster tÃªm distribuiÃ§Ãµes geogrÃ¡ficas amplas na bacia AmazÃ´nica. Potamorhina squamoralevis Ã© endÃªmica ao sistema Paraguai-ParanÃ¡. Registros de P. latior e P. laticeps para a bacia do Prata sÃ£o devidos a identificaÃ§Ãµes errÃ´neas de P. squamoralevis.Semitapicis, anteriormente utilizado para a maioria das espÃ©cies de Potamorhina (sensu lato) nÃ£o Ã© um nome adequado para o grupo em discussÃ£o mo presente trabalho. A espÃ©cie-tipo de Semitapicis (Charax planirostris de Gray, 1854) Ã© mais intimamente relacionada Ã s espÃ©cies do complexo Curimata cyprinoides. Este complexo e Potamorhina nÃ£o forman um grupo natural. Gasterotomus Eigenmann (1910), Suprasinelepichthys Fernandez-Yepez (1948) e Gasterostomus Fernandez-Yepez (1948) sÃ£o colocados na sinonÃ­mia de Potamorhina Cope (1878).

N2  - Intra- and interspecific patterns of variation are examined for species confused with or considered closely related to Eleutherodactylus guentheri. A total of six species are recognized in the E. guentheri cluster, three of them new. Descriptions are provided for the three new species; diagnoses and definitions are provided for all six. Members of the cluster are collectively associated with the middle and southern extent of the Atlantic Forest Morphoclimatic Domain in Brazil. Morphological differentiation among populations of E. guentheri is considerable, but there is no evidence of a strong geographic component to the intraspecific variation. This lack of widespread geographic variation, together with the restricted geographical distributions of the other species of the complex, suggests that differentiation occurred at very localized areas within the collective range of the species complex. The local differentiation pattern indicates that historical factors are critical to understanding present day patterns of differentiation and species distributions.

N2  - The genus Clypeomorus Jousseaume is confined to tropical intertidal habitats in the Indo-Pacific and is characterized by low spired, variably sculptured, frequently beaded shells.All species are eurytopic and style-bearing microphagous herbivores, having taenioglossate radulae. Internal anatomy is cerithioid: pallial gonoducts are open, males are aphallate and produce spermatophores. Development may be planktonic or nonplanktonic. The genus dates from the Miocene and represents a major cerithiid adaptive radiation onto hard substrata in the intertidal zone.Twelve living Clypeomorus species are recognized: C. bifasciata (Sowerby), C. brevis (Quoy and Gaimard), C. batillariaeformis Habe and Kosuge, C. pellucida (Hombron and Jacquinot), C. petrosa (Wood), C. purpurastoma, new species, C. inflata (Quoy and Gaimard), C. irrorata (Gould), C. admirabilis, new species, C. subbrevicula (Oostingh), C. adunca (Gould), C. nympha, new name. Three subspecies, C. bifasciata persica, new subspecies, C. petrosa chemnitziana (Pilsbry), C. petrosa gennesi (Fischer and Vignal), and three fossil species, C. verbeekii (H. Woodward), C. tjilonganensis (K. Martin), and C. alasaensis Wissema also are recognized. A cladistic analysis of Clypeomorus species using 20 characters comprising 50 character states derived from shell, radula, and anatomical features was made. Three clades or groups of closely related species were recognized but were not given higher taxonomic status because of unresolved polychotomies that might be clarified when additional anatomical data become available. The relationships of two species, C. adunca and C. nympha, remain unclear, and in the case of the latter taxon, allocation to Clypeomorus is questionable. A description and taxonomic discussion of the genus is presented and status of the type-species, Clypeomorus clypeomorus (= C. bifasciata) resolved. The synonymy, description, ecology, intra- and interspecific variation, biogeography, fossil records, and a list of material examined are discussed and presented for each species.

T1  - Evolutionary Differentiation: Differentiating Gold-banded Skippersâ€”Autochton cellus and More (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae: Pyrginae)

N2  - In the Smithsonian monograph of 1936 on the gold-banded skipper, Autochton cellus (Boisduval and Le Conte), Clark wrote, "This butterfly appears to be unusually uniform in its characters â€¦ throughout its range" and "there are no variations of geographical significance in this butterfly." Actually, there is important geographic variation both in biologic characters (population dispersion, temporal distribution, and larval foodplants) and in morphologic characters (size, facies, and especially male and female genitalia). (Clark was misled particularly by two males from Arizona or northern Mexico erroneously labelled Pennsylvania.) Genitalic differences indicate two major differentiates in A. cellus over its wide range from New Jersey southwest to southwestern Colorado and Arizona and thence southeast to El Salvador: one differentiate occurs mostly in hilly country of the southeastern United States (rarely in adjacent coastal plain); the other, in montane parts of the southwestern United States, Mexico, and northern Central America. A large intervening gap is slightly reduced by a very few populations in central and western Texas whose genitalic variation reflects extensive interbreeding between the differentiates in the recent past.Genitalic differences within A. cellus are likely nonadaptive. Because they are "constant" through each widespread and discontinuously distributed differentiate, they probably arose in a small isolate, became fixed, and thereafter were carried wherever the isolate went. The basic differentiation process was probably rapid and random. Overlays of finer geographic differentiation mediated by selection and involving various "external" characters (such as size and temporal distribution) developed more slowly later on. These views mesh with some expressed by "punctrockers," those paleontologists who have shaken phyletic gradualism and evolutionary theory generally with notions of punctuated equilibria and hierarchy.The mother differentiate within A. cellus is the one now ranging from the Southwest through Mexico to Central America and the daughter differentiate, the one now occurring in the eastern United States. Presumably the founding of a miniisolate somewhere off the northeastern frontier of the mother differentiate started the sequence of isolation, basic differentiation, range expansion, secondary contact, compatible hybridization, and finally, loss of contact in very recent time. This sort of thing has happened before with somewhat different results: the mother differentiate more or less coexists with a superficially similar but genitalically distinct sibling (A. siermadror, new species) in the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico.

A key to species, illustrations, and where appropriate, distribution maps are provided. One species, B. ibari Ninomiya, is recognized as the valid name for B. argentata of authors, not Walker, from the Old World. The identity of B. pleuralis Malloch, a species described from Australian specimens, is clarified. With its identification clearly established, B. pauliani Wirth (previously known from Madagascar and South Africa) becomes a junior synonym of B. pleuralis. Brachydeutera pleuralis is also found to occur in southern India. Brachydeutera pleuralis of authors, not Malloch, is named B. adusta, new species.

The present Heteroptera fauna contains 109 species in 61 genera; of these, Tempyra biguttula (Lygaeidae) and Tytthus parviceps (Miridae) are reported as new to the islands and the species formerly listed as Jadera sanguinolenta (Rhopalidae) is described as the new species, Jadera silbergliedi. With the exception of one species that belongs to an Old World genus, this fauna appears to be derived from American forms. One new generic synonymy is proposed: Aknisus McAtee is made a junior synonym of Metacanthus Costa, with the resulting new combination Metacanthus galapagensis (Barber).

N2  - The male of Rutiderma hartmanni Poulsen, 1965, is described and illustrated, and a supplementary description is given of the female with special emphasis on sexual dimorphism. Morphological differences in carapaces and limbs permitted functional analysis and reconstruction of the life history. All juveniles have the same life mode; they are unable to swim and thus are bottom dwellers; gut content and morphology of the mandible and maxilla indicate that they are predators. The adult male and female are able to swim, and the male is the more powerful swimmer; the adult female is a predator, whereas the adult male, which has mandibles much different from those of the female and has poorly developed maxillae, is probably a collector, feeding on detritus. Study of an A-1 adult male (last juvenile stage), preserved just prior to ecdysis and having adult male appendages visible within the appendages of the juvenile, supplied direct proof of the conspecifity of male and female rutidermatids, a conclusion previously based on indirect evidence. The central adductor muscle attachments are located close to valve midlength on the adult male and considerably anterior to valve midlength on adult females. It is suggested that the anterior location of the adductor muscle in the adult female provides room at the rear of the carapace for eggs, and that the midlength location of the adductor muscle in the adult male accommodates a greatly enlarged muscular protopodite of the 2nd antenna, essential for forceful swimming. Analysis of the muscles of the mandible disclosed that the strong chela on the end joint of the female is closed by 2 massive retractor muscles attached to a previously undescribed and unusual L-shaped sclerite; no protractor muscles are present to open the chela.

N2  - A new subgenus Biradiostomias (Eustomias brevibarbatus Parr, 1927, type-species) is described to include species of Eustomias with two long, free pectoral rays, a slender barbel stem without branches or external pigment spots, no ventral body groove behind the pectoral-fin base, and with photophore, vertebral, anal-ray, and tooth counts lower than in the subgenera Eustomias and Nominostomias, higher than in subgenus Haploclonus. Nineteen species of Biradiostomias are recognized, primarily on the basis of barbel structure. A key and table of diagnostic characters supplement descriptions, synonymies, graphs of barbel and postorbital-organ dimensions, and illustrations of barbels. Seven currently accepted species are recognized: E. dubius, polyaster, macrophthalmus, brevibarbatus, xenobolus, leptobolus, and ioani. Three species are resurrected from synonymy: E. pyrifer, variabilis, and schiffi. Two names are considered nomina dubia: E. micropterygius and globulifer. Nine species are described as new: E. contiguus, digitatus, dispar, hulleyi, hypopsilus, ignotus, quadrifilis, metamelas, and precarius. Eustomias ioani occurs in the northern subtropical North Pacific. The 18 other species occur only in the Atlantic, and only one of them (E. contiguus) extends into the eastern Atlantic. Ten species occur primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and waters close to the Bahamas and Antilles; only one of these has been taken in the Northern Sargasso Sea, and another extends into and south of the Amazon influence. Five species have oceanic distributions, three in the Northern Sargasso Sea or adjacent Slope Water, two in the Southern Sargasso Sea. Three species are known from single records in the northwestern tropical, southwestern tropical, and southwestern subtropical Atlantic.

N2  - The genus Pelinoides Cresson is revised for the first time and is divided into three species groups, with the following species: the pallipes group (P. andinus, cyclocerus, new species and P. pallipes, new species); the cyclocerus group (P. cyclocerus, new species); and the sulcatus group (P. sulcatus Cresson; P. pullus, new species; P. amblys, new species; P. chiloensis, new species; P. nigrihalteratus, new species; P. phaeopleurus, new species; P. australis, new species; P. chilensis, new species; P. colerus, new species; P. flavipalpus, new species; P. flinti, new species; P. phaeonotus, new species; P. fuscus, new species; P. obscurus, new species; P. opacus, new species; P. penai, new species; P. unctus Cresson; and P. pruinosus, new species). Of the three species groups, the pallipes group is structurally the most divergent, and from the standpoint of distribution the pallipes group is also the exception. Pelinoides generally has a temperate distribution, with species occurring at southern latitudes (Argentina and Chile) or at high elevation at latitudes closer to the Equator. The pallipes group, however, occurs in tropical lowlands on either side of the Andes. To provide perspective to this revision, an annotated key to the neotropical genera of Parydrinae, followed by a brief discussion, is provided. In that key and discussion the tribe Philygriini is tranferred from the subfamily Notiphilinae to Parydrinae. Keys to species groups and species, illustrations, and distribution maps are provided.

N2  - The two genera of thalassocaridid shrimps, Chlorotocoides and its single species and Thalassocaris and its three species, are reviewed briefly. A key is offered for the identification of the pandalid genera known from the Philippines and Indonesia. The monotypic genus Chlorotocella is recorded from the Philippines. The widespread species Chlorotocus crassicornis was taken by the Albatross in both the Philippines and Indonesia. A single specimen of the monotypic genus Dorodotes was collected in Makassar Strait, Indonesia. The monotypic genus Heterocarpoides is represented in the Albatross collections by 13 Philippine specimens. A key to all 20 recognized species and subspecies of Heterocarpus is attempted, and the antennal scales of those members represented in the Smithsonian collections are illustrated. Heterocarpus ensifer parvispina is recognized as an Indo-Pacific subspecies of an Atlantic species. The genus Parapandalus is abandoned as a taxon distinct from Plesionika, and a key is presented to the 46 species recognized in the latter genus from the Pacific and Indian oceans, including 12 new species and one new subspecies, all described from Philippine holotypes: P. acinacifer, P. fimbriata, P. intermedia, P. kensleyi, P. lophotes, P. parvimartia, P. philippinensis, P. pumila, P. quasigrandis, P. reflexa, P. simulatrix, P. spinensis, and P. martia orientalis.

N2  - Characters distinguishing 10 subgenera recognized in the genus Apogon of the cardinalfish family Apogonidae by the authors are given in a key. Diagnostic accounts of the two subgenera Pristiapogon and Zoramia are provided. A key to the six species of the subgenus Pristiapogon includes A. abrogramma, new species, A. kallopterus Bleeker, A. exostigma (Jordan and Starks), A. fraenatus Valenciennes, A. menesemus Jenkins, and A. taeniopterus Bennett. The key to the four species of the subgenus Zoramia includes A. leptacanthus Bleeker, A. perlitus, new species, A. gilberti (Jordan and Seale), and A. fragilis Smith.Data for important meristic and certain morphological characters are tabulated. All species are illustrated by photographs or drawings. The accounts of the species include primary synonymy, diagnosis, description, geographic distribution, life history data pertaining to oral incubation, discussion of relationships, and material studied.Apogon abrogramma is characterized by having seven first dorsal spines; the preopercular ridge and infraorbital edges serrated; a narrow, dark mid-body stripe from snout to base of caudal fin; no basicaudal spot; and well-developed gillrakers numbering 10-13. Apogon perlitus is characterized by having a black alimentary canal; six first dorsal spines; nine soft anal fin rays; a very small basicaudal spot; a dark gular mark; the side of caudal peduncle with a cluster of diffuse melanophores; 4 to 8 short, dark, vertical lines on body just above base of anal fin; and the second dorsal fin is not produced as a filament.Geographic distributions are plotted on maps for the 10 species comprising the two subgenera. Several species are widespread, extending from the Red Sea or the East African coast to eastern Oceania, whereas other species have more restricted distributions in parts of the Indo-West Pacific region. Apogon kallopterus has the most extensive distribution, extending from the Red Sea eastward to the Tuamotu Archipelago, Pitcairn Island, and the Hawaiian islands. Apogon menesemus is restricted to the Hawaiian and Johnston islands, whereas A. perlitus and A. gilberti share similar and limited distributions in the central portion of the study region, in the Philippine Islands, southern Palau Islands and the New Guinea area. Other distributional patterns were observed, such as the occurrence of A. abrogramma in the Indian Ocean eastward to the Philippine Islands.

T1  - Holocene Vertebrate Fossils from Isla Floreana, GalÃ¡pagos

N2  - This study surveys the late Holocene vertebrate fossil record from Isla Floreana, GalÃ¡pagos. Over 20,000 fossils from four lava tubes in the arid lowlands near Post Office Bay are associated with six radiocarbon dates of 2400 years B.P. or younger. The fossils, most of which originated as regurgitated pellets of barn owls, represent more than 1100 individual animals of 24 indigenous species. They include six species now extinct on Floreana: Geochelone elephantopus (tortoise), Alsophis biserialis (snake), Tyto punctatissima (GalÃ¡pagos Barn Owl), Mimus trifasciatus (Floreana Mockingbird), Geospiza nebulosa (Sharp-beaked Ground Finch), and Geospiza magnirostris (Large Ground Finch). These species are, respectively, 1st, 7th, 16th, 6th, 15th, and 2nd in abundance among all species recorded as fossils, making up 57% of the individuals in the fossil fauna. In addition, the 3rd and 4th most common fossil taxa, Tropidurus grayii (lava lizard) and Zenaida galapagoensis (GalÃ¡pagos Dove), are extremely rare today on Floreana. Thus, extinction probably has changed the composition of Floreana's fauna even more than is suggested by the number of extinct species alone.While the evidence is circumstantial, I believe that all extinction on Floreana is related to human impact, directly through predation and habitat alteration, and indirectly through the effects of alien animals (rats, mice, cats, dogs, pigs, goats, cattle, and donkeys). People and feral mammals have lived on Floreana since 1832, and most or all vertebrate extinction occurred within the succeeding 40-50 years. Direct predation by man and introduced mammals was probably the main cause of extinction only for Geochelone elephantopus, although such predation may have been involved to some extent in each of the other extinctions. Loss of preferred prey species and human predation probably caused the extinction of Tyto punctatissima. Extinction of Mimus trifasciatus and Geospiza magnirostris may have resulted from destruction of Opuntia cactus by feral herbivores. Extinction of Geospiza nebulosa may be related to habitat changes in the highlands. Buteo galapagoensis (GalÃ¡pagos Hawk), though not recorded as a fossil, is also apparently extinct on Floreana, with direct human predation likely to be the main cause. All extinction on Floreana occurred in historic times; whether this is true elsewhere in the GalÃ¡pagos awaits more research.Lasiurus borealis (Red Bat) is the only indigenous mammal recorded as a fossil. The absence of fossils of cricetine rodents or Conolophus spp. (Land Iguana) is evidence that these forms never occurred on Floreana. The lack of fossils of Coccyzus melacoryphus (Dark-billed Cuckoo) and Dendroica petechia (Yellow Warbler), which occur commonly on Floreana today, is evidence that these two species colonized the GalÃ¡pagos very recently.Fossil records depend upon suitable environments of deposition. The GalÃ¡pagos Islands, being of recent volcanic origin, lack many potentially fossiliferous geological features such as fine-grained alluvial sediments, indurated sand dunes, or limestone caves and sinkholes. Fortunately, lava tubes, which are very well suited for accumulation and preservation of vertebrate fossils, are common on certain islands in the GalÃ¡pagos.Fossils enable us to reconstruct undisturbed (pre-human) insular faunas more completely than previously possible. Modern biogeographical studies usually do not consider how natural the faunas are; they would benefit by considering changes wrought by human impact. The field of island biogeography would profit from a renewed emphasis on the collection of original field data rather than the current trend of theoretical studies that often are based upon inadequate or poorly understood data.

N2  - The subfamily Sarsiellinae is revised by emending 4 genera and proposing a new name for one of them. The distribution of Sarsiellidae on the continental shelves of eastern North America, the northern Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and Bermuda is discussed. The revised Sarsiellidae is comprised of 2 subfamilies: Dantyinae (2 genera) and Sarsiellinae (12 genera). In the study area, the Dantyinae are represented by the genus Dantya with 2 species (1 new), and the Sarsiellinae are represented by the genera Chelicopia with 1 species, Eurypylus with 1 species, Parasarsiella with 1 species, and Eusarsiella with 37 species (13 new and 3 left in open nomenclature). Collections in the study area are mainly from the continental shelves of eastern North America and the northern Gulf of Mexico. The new species as well as some previously known species are described and illustrated, and keys are presented for species in the study area as well as for taxa of higher rank. The number of eggs per clutch in the Sarsiellidae is shown to be, in part, a function of carapace length. Using Hennigian principles it is derived that the superfamilies in the Myodocopina are comprised of the following families:Cypridinacea, CypridinidaeCylindroleberidacea, CylindroleberididaeSarsiellacea, Philomedidae, Rutidermatidae, Sarsiellidae

N2  - The senior author's monographic treatment of the Rallidae, published in 1977, was based on data available to 1975. Corrections and additions to that treatment are presented here in the form of species accounts of rails, following the sequence presented in Rails of the World (Ripley, 1977). Relevant new information on the biology of the Rallidae are summarized, and appended is a bibliography of recent publications treating the members of the family. The accounts include the description of one species new to science, Rallus okinawae Yamashina and Mano, and four new subspecies: Rallus philippensis tounelieri Schodde and De Naurois, Laterallus jamaicensis tuerosi FjeldsÃ¥, Amaurornis phoenicurus midnicobaricus Abdulali, and Fulica  "ardesiaca"  atrura FjeldsÃ¥. A new systematic arrangement for the genus Laterallus, devised by Storer, is compared with that in Ripley (1977). Taxonomic notes are made on populations of Rallus pectoralis, Laterallus jamaicensis, Amaurornis phoenicurus, and Gallinula chloropus. Previously undescribed plumages of Atlantisia rogersi, Laterallus leucopyrrhus, Porzana spiloptera, and Gallinula tenebrosa are detailed. Range extensions are documented for Eulabeornis wolfi, Rallus maculatus, Coturnicops ayresi, C. schomburgkii, Laterallus levraudi, L. xenopterus, Porzana albicollis, and P. erythrops. New ecological data for Rallus limicola, Gallirallus australis, Porzana fluminea, Gallinula alleni, and Fulica americana are reviewed. Remarks on behavior are included for Porzana flavirostra, P. carolina, Gallinula mortieri, and G. tenebrosa. New nesting observations are described for Eulabeornis castaneoventris, E. concolor, Rallina tricolor, Gallinula chloropus, and Fulica gigantea. Descriptions are made of calls of Canirallus cuvieri, Rallina euryzonoides, and Coturnicops rufa, among others. Status reports on the following endangered populations are summarized: Rallus poecilopterus, R. owstoni, R. semiplumbeus, R. longirostris levipes, Porzana marginalis, and Gallinula nesiotis. Finally, emendations of the original text are made for Rallus philippensis, Rallina leucospila, Rallina canningi, Laterallus exilis, L. melanophaius, and Amaurornis akool. The species accounts are followed by a list of references cited in the accounts, supplemented by uncited works that offer additional specialized information; in combination, this bibliography represents a nine-year survey of the copious rallid literature.

N2  - The 42 species of stylasterid corals (Hydrozoa: Athecata: Stylasteridae) known from the Northwest Atlantic are described and illustrated, and their distributions are mapped. Twenty-one new species are described. The study is based on specimens collected from approximately 330 localities, including the collections of the National Museum of Natural History (USNM), Museum of Comparative Zoology (Harvard), and Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, University of Miami (UMML). Previous literature on the fauna is reviewed. All species are illustrated by scanning electron micrographs, and about half of the species were examined by histological serial section of decalcified specimens. A dichotomous key to the eight western Atlantic genera and tabular keys to the species of Distichopora, Stylaster, and Crypthelia are provided.Distributional patterns of the western Atlantic stylasterids and comparisons to the distributional patterns of the ahermatypic Scleractinia are discussed. Few stylasterids have widespread distributions; 93% of the species are endemic to the western Atlantic. Stylaster roseus, the only shallow-water species, has the broadest distribution in the Caribbean. Unlike the deep-water Scleractinia, stylasterids are not present in waters directly adjacent to continental land masses, and thus do not occur in the Gulf of Mexico, off northern continental South America, or off Central America. Stylasterids are usually found in shallower water than ahermatypic Scleractinia: their depth range is rarely less than 100 m or more than 1000 m, but most commonly 150-440 m. Both groups, however, are most diverse in the Lesser Antilles and share several distributional patterns, i.e., Antillean, insular Straits of Florida, and continental slopes off the southeastern United States.

N2  - A total of 10,173 ostracods was recovered from 45 crayfish collected during a water quality survey in spring, summer, fall, and winter in Eagle Drain, Ada County, Idaho. Population densities of ostracods were determined by sex, month, season, instar, and reproductive condition of the crayfish host. Ostracod shell lengths and heights were evaluated by instar, season, and sex. Water quality measurements were carried out to determine ecological conditions under which ostracods and crayfish hosts were living.

N2  - The calanoid copepod Pleuromamma xiphias was studied from samples collected in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean from the upper 1200 m at 17Â°50'N, 25Â°30'W over a six-day period. Only stages II to VI were found among 9546 copepodids in various aliquots from 28 samples. Ontogenetic changes in the external skeletal morphology result in increasing complexity in the number of body tagmata, appendages, appendage segments, and armature. Changes in the last three are more pronounced in swimming and reproductive appendages than in feeding appendages. A modified, scythe-like terminal spine on the first swimming leg exopod of CII is the only specialized skeletal structure not present in adults; a simple, attenuate spine is present in all later stages. The degree of sexual dimorphism is greatest in CVI, expressed primarily as changes in male morphology, and includes asymmetry of the swimming legs.Ontogenetic changes in vertical distribution include compact but progressively deeper distributions during the day, with upward and downward dispersion at night. Both sexes of CV exhibit a bimodal distribution. In CVI this bimodality is asymmetrical, with more females at the shallow, primary mode and more males at the deeper, secondary mode.Pleuromamma xiphias exhibits statistically significant reductions in proportion of males and left females between CV and CVI. These reductions are assumed to be biologically significant. If sex is genetically controlled, balancing selection should act to favor males during a period of ontogeny when sexual dimporphism is not expressed phenotypically, unless CVI males are selected against after their reproductive potential is realized. A balanced dimorphism is hypothesized for the distribution of asymmetry in females; selection for right females during ontogeny is balanced by preference for left CVI females by CVI males during mating.

N2  - A phylogenetic analysis of the glandulocaudine genera Argopleura, Iotabrycon, Scopaeocharax (new), Tyttocharax, and Xenurobrycon indicates that they form a monophyletic group, the Xenurobryconini. Their relationships to other glandulocaudine characids and the monophyly of the Glandulocaudinae remain uncertain. Hypotheses concerning the evolution and relationships of the glandulocaudine characids are reviewed and evaluated.The phylogenetic analysis of the Xenurobryconini is based on innovative, mostly sexually dimorphic characters in males and on reductive features of both sexes. The large number of sexually dimorphic apomorphies we list for some of the taxa is a measure of the complexity of the sexual morphology in xenurobryconins. The reductive characters are mostly reduction and/or loss of parts of the laterosensory canal system and some of the associated bones of the head and shoulder girdle. These reductions are similar to those recorded for other groups of small to minute characids but are independently derived. Usually small adult body length, reductive features, and innovative sexual characters are congruent in xenurobryconins. The described laterosensory canal reductions and certain innovative aspects of the caudal pump mechanisms may be correlated with increased resistance of water to flow encountered in these structures in small fishes of 12 to 25 millimeters in adult standard length. Our phylogenetic hypothesis indicates that reversal of laterosensory reductions to a more primitive state may occur as a correlate of reversal to a somewhat larger body size.The phylogenetic analysis of the xenurobryconin genera indicates that Argopleura, whose member species attain the greatest body length of all species in the Xenurobryconini, is the most primitive morphologically and the sister group of all other xenurobryconins; that Iotabrycon is the sister taxon of a lineage comprising Xenurobrycon, Scopaeocharax, and Tyttocharax; and that Xenurobrycon forms a sister group to Scopaeocharax and Tyttocharax. The distributions of the genera are summarized and a three-area cladogram is presented.Xenurobrycon was found to consist of three species: X. marcopus from several localities in the Rio Paraguay-Rio ParanÃ¡ basin of Paraguay and Brazil; X. pteropus, a new species known only from Fonte Boa on the middle Rio SolimÃµes, Brazil; and X. heterodon, a new species known from the RÃ­o Pachitea of eastern Peru, and from the RÃ­o Aguarico (RÃ­o Napo drainage) and upper RÃ­o Pastaza, both of eastern Ecuador. These latter rivers are Andean tributaries of the western Amazon system. The phylogenetic relationships among the species of Xenurobrycon were not studied.The anatomy of the putative pheromone pumping mechanisms in the caudal region of glandulocaudines is described and discussed. Two widely different pumping mechanisms were found, a diaphragm pump and a fin-ray pump. The first of these has at least two functionally and anatomically different forms, including a passive pump apparently operated by tail-beating during courtship display and a directly driven muscular diaphragm pump found in one subgroup of miniature xenurobryconins. The hydrodynamics of the pump systems are briefly discussed in relation to their morphology, size differences, and the resistance of water to flow in small tube-like structures.

N2  - The cosmotropical spider family Theridiosomatidae is revised at the generic level to contain 9 genera: Theridiosoma O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1879, Ogulnius O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1882, Wendilgarda Keyserling, 1886, Epeirotypus O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1894, Baalzebub, new genus (type-species B. baubo, new species), Epilineutes, new genus (type-species Theridiosoma globosum O. Pickard-Cambridge), Plato, new genus (type-species P. troglodita, new species), Naatlo, new genus (type-species N. sutila, new species), and Chthonos, new name. Of the 22 genera historically associated with the family, 17 have been rejected, transferred, or synonymized. Theridilella Chamberlin and Ivie, 1936 (damaged specimen), and Allototua Bryant, 1945 (unique specimen lost), are considered unrecognizable nomina dubia;  Haliger Mello-LeitÃ£o lacks the defining features of theridiosomatids and is considered incertae sedis. Diotherisoma di Caporiacco, 1947, is transferred to the Araneidae and Totua Keyserling, 1891, to the Linyphiidae. The previous transfers of Colphepeira Archer, 1941, to the Araneidae, Billima Simon, 1908, Helvidia Thorell, 1890, and Spheropistha Yaginuma, 1957, to the Theridiidae, Cyatholipulus Petrunkevitch, 1930, to the Symphytognathidae, Cyatholipus Simon, 1894, and Tekella Urquhart, 1894, to the Cyatholipinae (Tetragnathidae), and Parogulnius Archer, 1953, and Phricotelus Simon, 1895, to the Mysmenidae are not contested. The genus Andasta Simon, 1895, is synonymized with Theridiosoma, and Enthorodera Simon, 1907, and Cyathidea Simon, 1907, with Wendilgarda. Theridiosoma argentatum Keyserling, 1886, and T. radiosum (McCook, 1881) are synonymized with T. gemmosum (L. Koch, 1878), and Wendilgarda panamica Archer, 1953, W. hassleri Archer, 1953, and W. theridionina Simon, 1895, with W. clara Keyserling, 1886. Tecmessa tetrabuna Archer, 1958, and Epeirotypus gloriae Petrunkevitch, 1930, are transferred to Ogulnius. Maymena bruneti Gertsch, 1960, and Wendilgarda guacharo Brignoli, 1972, W. miranda Brignoli, 1972, and W. bicolor Keyserling, 1886, are transferred to Plato. Theridiosoma fauna Simon, 1897, T. splendidum (Taczanowski, 1873), and T. sylvicola Hingston, 1932, are transferred to Naatlo. Theridiosoma albinotatum Petrunkevitch, 1930, and T. brauni Wunderlich, 1976, are transferred to Baalzebub. Theridiosoma nigrum (Keyserling, 1886) is returned to Wendilgarda. The genus Tecmessa O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1882, is valid but the name is preoccupied (Tecmessa Burmeister, 1878: Lepidoptera); the new name Chthonos replaces it. The new genera Baalzebub, Epilineutes, Naatlo, and Plato, and the new species Baalzebub baubo, Plato troglodita, Naatlo sutila, and Epeirotypus chavarria are described. The sister taxon of the Theridiosomatidae is the Mysmenidae-Symphytognathidae-Anapidae clade. A cladogram for theridiosomatid genera is presented.

N2  - Although Wallengrenia otho (Smith) and W. egeremet (Scudder) were described as different species (in 1797 and 1863), once egeremet was listed as a variety of otho (in 1877), it tended to stay that way. By mid-twentieth century (what with a little evolution in terminology and concepts), egeremet was generally called a subspecies of otho, which meant (by definition) that the two must be allopatric. Because geographic overlap was apparent, American workers variously (1) invoked a considerable blend zone between the subspecies, (2) pronounced subspecies egeremet a form of otho in their area of sympatry, or (3) suffered sympatric subspecies. The English skipperman Evans (in 1955) deferred to American subspecific usage but noted that egeremet might better be viewed as a species. This view, which is correct, gradually prevailed.Supporting evidence accumulated over the past two decades from about 2500 specimens is here marshalled and critically analyzed. The genitalia of W. otho and W. egeremet differ strongly, in males, in the distal ends of the aedeagus and valvae and, in females, in the ductus bursae. Superficially, otho is more warmly colored but harder looking and more sharply patterned, whereas egeremet is colder but softer and somewhat blurred. Common in the Gulf States (including the Florida Keys), otho ranges westward to about 99Â° and northward to (rarely) the Baltimore-Washington area and the vicinity of Chicago; more common to the north, egeremet ranges from the Gulf States (excluding southern Florida) to southern Canada and westward to about 96Â°-97Â°. Though otho is everywhere multivoltine, egeremet is univoltine over much of its range; but both species are bivoltine and essentially synchronic in their main area of sympatry. Winglength reliably reflects adult size; after allowing for sexual dimorphism (females average larger than males) and geographic variation, it is clear that egeremet is a significantly larger species than otho in eastern North America. Due to prolonged and widespread confusion of otho and egeremet, detailed lists of specimens examined are provided.

The new species and some previously known species are described and illustrated. Keys are given for genera and species in the study area. Distribution is discussed, shown on 4 maps, and listed in 2 tables. In addition, the zoogeography of all Myodocopina in the study area is analyzed and related to faunal provinces; a map is presented showing distribution of provinces. Diversity of species is highest in the middle neritic zone (20-100m) and increases from North to South along the Atlantic coast of North America, but is the same in the NE and NW quadrants of the Gulf of Mexico.

N2  - The 14 species of stylasterids known from the GalÃ¡pagos Islands are described and illustrated by scanning electron photomicrographs. Nine species are described as new. Seven of the 14 species were examined histologically. A historical review of the previous work on stylasterids from the GalÃ¡pagos is given. All 14 species are endemic to the GalÃ¡pagos; however, at the generic level there is a strong affinity with the western Pacific. To help distinguish among the 25 species of Crypthelia found worldwide, six of which occur in the GalÃ¡pagos, a tabulation of ampullae and efferent pore arrangements was constructed: there are three types of female arrangements and eight male variations. Of a possible total of 24 permutations of male-female combinations, only twelve have thus far been discovered.

T1  - Age Determination of Loggerhead Sea Turtles, Caretta caretta, by Incremental Growth Marks in the Skeleton

N2  - Periosteal growth in the skeleton of Caretta caretta is cyclic and produces a record of distinct bony layers (growth marks). These layers are most apparent in the long bones, particularly the humerus and femur. Correlative evidence supports the production of one layer (i.e., growth increment) each year in some reptiles, and the annual nature of each bony layer is an explicit assumption in our estimation of ages of Caretta from Cumberland Island, Georgia. Sections from the shafts of humeri were prepared with standard histological techniques, and the marks of skeletal growth were counted and measured. Owing to resorption of the early periosteal layers, determination of number of growth marks and, hence, age requires an extrapolation from the remaining marks to total growth marks produced during the life of the turtle. Various age estimates are possible; the most reliable are derived from the narrowest axis of the humerus sections and suggest that, on the average, Georgia Caretta attain sexual maturity in their thirteenth to fifteenth years, with some individuals possibly maturing as early as six years and others as late as their twenty-fifth year. Since the average age of maturity agrees with the results of a mark-recapture study in a neighboring Florida population, the value of the skeletochronological technique and its assumptions are confirmed. The technique is not advocated as a method for the age determination of individual sea turtles, but does provide statistical age estimates for different size classes of turtles.

N2  - The New World species of Lasioglossum (sensu stricto) are revised, based on a study of approximately 25,000 specimens. Fifty-one species are recognized, with 20 described as new. All species are fully described and diagnosed. Flight records are summarized with histogram plots, distributions indicated by dot maps, and illustrated keys provided for species identification. Floral association data are summarized (5348 records) and compared to similar data for California Bombini. The association of Lasioglossum species with phoretic histiostomatid and scuticarid mites is reviewed and infestation levels for involved species presented. A preliminary study of the phylogenetic interrelationships of included species is presented, which includes a character matrix intended to facilitate future cladistic efforts.The new species are L. acarophilum, L. acuminatum, L. anhypops, L. argutum, L. asaphes, L. bajaense, L. cercothrix, L. channelense, L. eickworti, L. katyae, L. lampronotum, L. orphnaeum, L. paraforbesii, L. parkeri, L. perscabrum, L. rupticristum, L. sandrae, L. timberlakei, L. tropidonotum, and L. xyriotropis. Lasioglossum egregium (Vachal) is elevated from junior synonymy, and the following names relegated to synonymy: Halictus supercretus Cockerell under L. circinatum (Vachal); H. ripariellus Cockerell under L. colatum (Vachal); H. matensis Friese under L. costale (Vachal); H. sericeus Friese under L. crocoturum (Vachal); H. cyaneiceps Cockerell under L. desertum (Smith); H. olympiae subangustus Cockerell under L. sisymbrii (Cockerell). A neotype is designated for H. trizonatus Cresson and lectotypes designated for H. costalis Vachal, H. matensis Friese, H. crocoturus Vachal, H. desertus Smith, H. fuscipennis Smith, H. manitouellus Cockerell, H. pacificus Cockerell, and H. sisymbrii Cockerell. Halictus schenckii is treated as a nomen dubium.

N2  - In recent catalog treatments of Placopsidella, the genus has been suggested to comprise two described species, with the type-species, P. cynocephala, being widespread. Other species were described, but these have been treated as junior synonyms. This study reveals that there are eight known species in the genus and that all of the so-called junior synonyms are valid species. Placopsidella opaca Miyagi, however, is here reported to be a synonym of P. grandis (Cresson). Gymnopa marquesana Malloch is also transferred to Placopsidella, and P. insulana and P. phaeonota are newly described. These species are segregated into two species groups, the cynocephala group, with six species, and the liparoides group, with two species; the relationships of the groups' component species are analyzed and discussed. Likewise the generic relationships are discussed, and a key to the tribes of Psilopinae is provided. For each species, revisionary treatment is presented, including illustrations of male terminalia and other appropriate characters and distribution maps. The phylogenetic relationships of the species are graphically presented in a cladogram.

T1  - Seasonal Variation in Use of Time and Space by the Wedge-capped Capuchin Monkey, Cebus olivaceus: Implications for Foraging Theory

N2  - The relationship between the foraging behavior of a group of wedge-capped capuchin monkeys Cebus olivaceus and the abundance and spatial distribution of resources, was examined in a highly seasonal gallery forest in central Venezuela during 14 months. The aim of the study was to evaluate the behavioral mechanisms regulating group foraging. How the group forages depends on the information that animals possess about resource availabilities in their home range. Can the foraging behavior be predicted by assuming that animals know about resource abundances (both in areas where the animals are and for the whole area), the spatial distribution of specific resources, or the actual locations and qualities of specific resources?The composition of the diet varied seasonally, with animals being less selective in periods of scarcity. The amount of time that animals forage increases with resource abundance, but only in the dry season, when food is scarce. During the wet season, foraging time is determined by the digestive capacities of the animals. The pattern of group movements and use of space do not depend on the amount of time that animals forage, the proportion of time allocated to foraging on specific items, or the spatial distribution of resources, but they are predictable from the specific distribution, both the patchiness and clumping of patches, of the most common resource available each month.Foraging groups of capuchin monkeys thus have considerable information on resource location and quality and navigate over their ranges on the basis of that knowledge. This capacity is advantageous in a species that exploits ripe fruit, a resource that varies predictably in time and space. Large ranges ensure that fruiting species are available throughout the year. Because group ranges overlap completely and groups compete for access to fruiting trees, groups are large.

N2  - Keys are offered for identifying all of the taxa currently recognized in the family Oplophoridae, including three new monotypic genera: Heterogenys for Acanthephyra microphthalma, Janicella for Oplophorus spinicauda, and Kemphyra for Notostomus corallinus. Of the 27 species remaining in the genus Acanthephyra, 14 are now known from the Philippine-Indonesian region. One new species is proposed in the genus Ephyrina; E. childressi was collected in the Halmahera Sea by the Alpha Helix in 1975, bringing to six the number of species recognized in that genus; two of the three species encountered in the Philippine-Indonesian regionâ€”E. figueirai and E. ombangoâ€”were originally described from the eastern Atlantic. Four species are currently recognized in the genus Hymenodora, but none of them have been definitely recorded from the Philippines or Indonesia. Five species are represented in the genus Meningodora, but some doubt is expressed about the inclusion of other than the type-species, M. mollis. The eight species recognized in the genus Notostomus are distinguished in a distinctly provisional key. Four species remain in the genus Oplophorus after the removal of O. spinicauda. All five species currently known in the genus Systellaspis are recorded from the Philippine-Indonesian region. Illustrations are offered of as many oplophorid species as possible, especially of the mandibles, first and second maxillipeds, endopods of the first male pleopods, and the appendices internae and masculinae, all of which proved to be variably significant as diagnostic generic and/or specific characters. Seven species are covered in a key to the Philippine-Indonesian species of the genus Nematocarcinus, including a new species, N. bituberculatus from Lagonoy Gulf, southeastern Luzon, and off the west coast of Halmahera.

Color in life is recorded for the first time for Gonodactylus falcatus (ForskÃ¥l). Records from the Red Sea for Gonodactylus smithii Pocock are identified with G. acutirostris De Man and records of G. chiragra (Fabricius) are corrected to G. botti Manning. Alima neptuni (Linnaeus, 1768) is shown to be the oldest available name for the species previously known as Alima hyalina Leach, 1817; this species is recorded from the Red Sea for the first time. Thirty-three species of Stomatopoda are now known to occur in the Red Sea.

N2  - The general morphology, biogeography, and classification of a new family and superfamily of monotrysian moths are reviewed. To assess the proper relationships of this new taxon, the phylogeny of the infraorder Heteroneura, division Monotrysia is also summarized. The sister group of the Palaephatidae (Palaephatoidea) has been determined as the Nepticuloidea + Tischerioidea largely on the basis of their similar monotrysian, non-piercing ovipositors, with the oviporous opening between the eighth and ninth abdominal sterna. The distribution of the family is restricted largely to the temperate forests of southern Argentina and Chile, with a single genus reported from Australia. A total of 5 genera and 28 species are recognized from the New World. Four new genera, Sesommata, Metaphatus, Plesiophatus, and Apophatus are described as well as one new subgenus, Prophatus, of Palaephatus Meyrick. Twenty-five new species are named, including Sesommata leuroptera, S. trachyptera, S. paraplatysaris, S. albimaculata, Metaphatus spatulatus, M. ochraceous, M. ichnius, M. cirrhus, M. sinuatus, M. adustus, Plesiophatus inarmigerus, Palaephatus dimorphus, P. leucacrotus, P. nielseni, P. spinosus, P. latus, P. fusciterminus, P. albiterminus, P. striatus, P. amplisaccus, P. pallidus, P. luteolus, P. albicerus, Apophatus parvus, and A. bifibratus. Distribution maps and keys are provided for all South American species. Diagnostic characters of all taxa are fully illustrated by line drawings and photographs.

Three previously known species are redescribed and three endemic species, asilivorus Pulawski, tissa Pulawski, and vedda Pulawski, are described. Gastrosericus maracandicus dubius Gussakovskij, 1931, is synonymized with waltlii Spinola, 1839, and thailanditus Tsuneki, 1974, with rothneyi Cameron, 1889. A lectotype is designated for rothneyi Cameron. Behavioral and ecological data are presented for the first time for asilivorus, rothneyi, and tissa and compared with details known for other species. Two unusual discoveries are the use of asilid flies as prey by asilivorus instead of the orthopteroids used by other species; and the placement of the egg on the ceiling of the cell of rothneyi rather than on one of the prey.

N2  - The genus Neaspilota Osten Sacken is revised, and its relationships within the subfamily Terelliinae are discussed. The distribution of the genus ranges from Alaska to northern Mexico. The genus contains two monophyletic sublineages, herein recognized as subgenera: Neaspilota, sensu stricto, and Neorellia, new subgenus. Nineteen species are recognized, including eight new ones, the latter all in the subgenus Neorellia: Neaspilota aenigma, N. albiseta, N. appendiculata, N. callistigma, N. footei, N. isochela, N. pubescens, and N. stecki. The asymmetry of the male foretarsus, found in all but one species, is an excellent character at the specific and generic levels. The female spermatheca is likewise an important character at the generic/subgeneric level, but less so at the specific level. Approximately 60 host-plant species, all in the family Asteraceae, have been recorded for Neaspilota. Host plants have been listed under the appropriate species of Neaspilota and in a separate section. Species of Neaspilota, sensu stricto, are associated with species of Vernonia, while species of Neorellia are associated with many other genera, none, however, belonging to the tribe Cynareae, to which most of the known host plants of Holarctic Terelliinae belong.

N2  - Optical and histological studies have been carried out on the eye of the Mediterranean mantis shrimp Squilla mantis (Linnaeus), with emphasis on correlation of observations based on the different methodologies. The ommatidia have acceptance angles of 2.4Â°, comparable to those of other compound eyes, but the wide apertures, 20Â°, of the cornea-cone units apparently are an adaptation to the dimly lit natural habitat of the species. Skewing of optical axes in the ommatidia of the double cornea suggests that each eye is capable of distance perception. Three systems of tangential nerve fibers in the lamina connect sets of cartridges in specific arrays. Giant fiber trees extend throughout the medulla externa. The medulla interna also contains large, extensively branched, integrating fibers. All ganglia, at least up to the medulla interna, are structurally divided into an upper and a lower half and contain large integrating fibers connecting the two halves. Optical findings are correlated with histological findings.

N2  - The Neotropical catfish family Helogenidae is revised. Contrary to recent practice, a single genus Helogenes GÃ¼nther is recognized, with Leyvaichthys Dahl treated as a synonym. Four species are recognized in the genus. Helogenes marmoratus GÃ¼nther, an inhabitant of black and clearwater streams, is distributed throughout the Atlantic drainages of the Guianas and the upper RÃ­o Orinoco of Venezuela, and within the Amazon basin has been collected in Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, and Ecuador. Helogenes castaneus (Dahl) is known only from the RÃ­o Orinoco tributaries of eastern Colombia. Helogenes uruyensis FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez is evidently endemic to the vicinity of Auyantepui in the upper RÃ­o CaronÃ­, a southern tributary of the RÃ­o Orinoco in southeastern Venezuela. Helogenes gouldingi, a previously unrecognized species, is described from a blackwater tributary of the Rio Madeira in Brazil.Helogenes amazonae Delsman, described from an individual collected near Manaus, Brazil, and H. unidorsalis Glodek and Carter, based on specimens from eastern Ecuador, are considered synonyms of H. marmoratus. The presence or absence of an adipose dorsal fin, a character that has been used to discriminate genera and species within the Helogenidae, has been found to vary within western Amazonian populations of Helogenes marmoratus, and such variability is hypothesized to occur in H. castaneus. A key to the species and descriptions of recognized taxa are provided.Se revisa la familia de bagres neotropicales Helogenidae. Contrariamente a la prÃ¡ctica reciente se reconoce solo un gÃ©nero: Helogenes GÃ¼nther; Leyvaichthys propuesto por Dahl se presenta como sinÃ³nimo. Se consideran cuatro especies en el gÃ©nero. Helogenes marmoratus GÃ¼nther, tiene amplia distribuciÃ³n a travÃ©s de la cuenca atlÃ¡ntica de Guianas, el Alto Orinoco de Venezuela y en la cuenca amazÃ³nica ha sido colectado en Venezuela, Brasil, PerÃº y Ecuador. Helogenes castaneus (Dahl) se conoce Ãºnicamente de los tributarios del Orinoco del este de Colombia. Helogenes uruyensis FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez es evidentemente endÃ©mico de los alrededores de Auyantepui, Alto RÃ­o Caroni, un tributario sureÃ±o del RÃ­o Orinoco en el sureste de Venezuela. Helogenes gouldingi, una especie previamente desconocida, es descrita de una serie de especÃ­menes provenientes del sistema del Rio Madeira en Brasil.Helogenes amazonae Delsman, descrita sÃ³lamente a partir de un ejemplar colectado cerca de Manaus, Brasil, y H. unidorsalis Glodek y Carter, basado en una muestra obtenida en el RÃ­o Bobonaza, en el este del Ecuador, son considerados sinÃ³nimos de H. marmoratus. La presencia o ausencia de una aleta dorsal adiposa, un carÃ¡cter que ha sido utilizado para discriminar gÃ©neros y especies dentro de Helogenidae, se ha determinado que varÃ­a entre poblaciones de H. marmoratus de la AmazonÃ­a Occidental y tal variabilidad se hipotetiza que tambiÃ©n ocurre en H. castaneus. Se incluye una clave para las especies, descripciones de los taxa reconocidos, y se discute en amplitud algunos caracteres importantes de la familia.

N2  - The crayfish fauna of Madagascar consists of six species belonging to the endemic genus Astacoides. Four of them, originally recognized as varieties of a single species Astacoides madagascarensis and subsequently accorded subspecific status, are elevated to specific rank. Two, A. crosnieri and A. petiti, are described as new. Following remarks on the limited range of the genus, which appears to be confined to higher elevations in the eastern part of the island between 18Â° and 25Â° South latitude and 46Â° to 49Â° East longitude, are notes on the organization of the text and a resumÃ© of our previous knowledge of the genus. This is followed by discussions of the taxonomic characters considered in the study, the common origin of the disjunct Astacoides with other parastacid stocks, and the evolution and interrelationships of the Madagascan species. A diagnosis of the genus accompanies a key provided for the recognition of its members. A synonymy, diagnosis, description, statement of range, list of localities and specimens examined, and illustrations are provided for each species.

N2  - A modified and expanded definition of Nannosquilla is presented along with redescriptions of N. hancocki and N. antillensis. Two new species are described from the Caribbean Sea based on specimens previously reported as N. antillensis, including the paratypes from St. John, Virgin Islands (N. virginalis), and another specimen from Banco Chinchorro, Yucatan (N. yucatanica). Another new species, N. disca, is described from the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off Florida. The second known specimen of N. adkisoni is compared with the holotype, and the third specimen of N. carolinensis is reported. A key to identification of western Atlantic species of Nannosquilla is offered. Lysiosquilla varicosa provisionally was assigned to Nannosquilla when the genus was erected in 1963. The species does not conform to our current understanding of the limits of the genus. It is relegated to the status of species inquirendum; there are no extant specimens, and the original description omits characters diagnostic at the genus-group level.

N2  - The family Planaxidae Gray comprises a small, monophyletic, mainly pantropical marine group of six extant genera in the superfamily Cerithiacea Fleming that are adapted to an intertidal environment. They are microphagous herbivores and usually occur in large populations on hard substrates. Planaxids are gonochoristic and have open pallial gonoducts, aphallic males, produce spermatophores, and brood their young in specialized cephalic brood pouches of ectodermal origin. Embryos of most species are released at the veliger stage and undergo a planktotrophic phase before settlement, but some species undergo a direct, lecithotrophic development. Species in the genus Angiola are unique among prosobranchs in having a bioluminescent mantle organ.On the basis of morphological homology, ontogeny, and advocacy, Batillaria (of the subfamily Batillariinae, family Potamididae) and Melanoides (of the freshwater family Thiaridae) were chosen as outgroups for phylogenetic analysis of all genera except Holcostoma. The polarities of characters were established by outgroup comparison, and transformation series of multi-state characters were ordered by structural complexity and by reciprocal illumination. Two equally parsimonious cladograms were produced that arrange the taxa in essentially similar sequence. Planaxis and Fissilabia share many apomorphies as do Angiola and Hinea. Six recent genera are recognized as comprising the Planaxidae: Planaxis Lamarck, 1822; Fissilabia Macgillivray, 1836; Supplanaxis Thiele, 1929; Hinea Gray, 1847; Angiola Dall, 1926; Holcostoma H. and A. Adams, 1853. Synonymies, conchological, radular and anatomical descriptions, and the ecology and life histories of each genus are presented.

N2  - The three neotropical genera Disersus Sharp (1882), Pseudodisersus Brown (1981), and Potamophilops Grouvelle (1896) are revised. Keys are provided for the following: the two subfamilies, Larainae and Elminae, recognized in the Elmidae; the nine genera from the New World assigned to the Larainae; the species assigned to the genus Disersus; and to separate the larvae of Disersus and Pseudodisersus. All included taxa are described or redescribed; synonymies are cited; maps showing known distribution are included for each species. Pertinent character states for recognition of the various taxa are illustrated by photographs, line drawings, or scanning electron micrographs. The larvae of Disersus and Pseudodisersus are described, illustrated, and distinguished in a key; their food habits are reported; a valve-like structure in the gut is discussed and illustrated; and their large air reservoirs are described and illustrated.Ten species are now included in the genus Disersus. Three previously described speciesâ€”Disersus cacicus (CoquÃ©rel, 1851), D. longipennis Sharp (1882), and D. uncus Spangler and Santiago (1982)â€”are redescribed; the following new species are described: D. ambocheilus, D. chibcha, D. dasycolus, D. inca, D. pilitibia, D. quincemil, and D. saxicola.The type-species designated by Brown for his genus Pseudodisersus, P. coquereli Brown (1981), is found to be conspecific with Pseudodisersus goudotii (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville, 1843) and is placed in synonymy; therefore, P. goudotii is now the type-species of the monotypic genus Pseudodisersus.The monotypic genus Potamophilops and the single, presently included species, P. cinereus (Blanchard, 1841), are redescribed and illustrated.Se revisan los tres gÃ©neros neotropicales Disersus Sharp (1882), Pseudodisersus Brown (1981), y Potamophilops Grouvelle (1896). Se proveen claves para los siguientes niveles: las dos subfamilias, Larainae y Elminae, que se reconocen en los Elmidae; los nueve gÃ©neros del Nuevo Mundo asignados a los Larainae; las especies asignadas al gÃ©nero Disersus; y para separar las larvas de Disersus y Pseudodisersus. Todos los taxa incluÃ­dos son descritos o redescritos; las sinonimias correspondientes son citadas; se incluyen mapas mostrando la distribuciÃ³n conocida para cada especie. Los principales caracteres para el reconocimiento de los diversos taxa, se ilustran por medio de fotografias, esquemas o microfotografias de microscopio electrÃ³nico. Las larvas de Disersus y Pseudodisersus se describen, ilustran y se separan por medio de una clave; se reportan sus hÃ¡bitos alimenticios; se ilustra y discute la presencia de una estructura con forma de valva en el intestino; y sus grandes reservorios de aire se describen e ilustran.Diez especies se incluyen ahora en el gÃ©nero Disersus. Tres especies previamente descritasâ€”Disersus cacicus (CoquÃ©rel, 1851), D. longipennis Sharp (1882), y D. uncus Spangler y Santiago (1982)â€”son redescritas; las siguientes especies nuevas son descritasâ€”D. ambocheilus, D. chibcha, D. dasycolus, D. inca, D. pilitibia, D. quincemil, y D. saxicola.La especie tipo designada por Brown para su gÃ©nero Pseudodisersus, P. coquereli Brown (1981), se encontrÃ³ concspecÃ­fico con Pseudodisersus goudotti (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville, 1843) y es colocada en sinonimia; por lo tanto, P. goudotti es ahora la especie tipo del gÃ©nero monotÃ­pico Pseudodisersus.El gÃ©nero monotipico Potamophilops y la Ãºnica especie incluÃ­da, P. cinereus (Blanchard, 1841), son redescritos e ilustrados.

N2  - The poecilostome family Taeniacanthidae, copepods parasitic on marine fishes and sea urchins, currently consists of 14 genera and 91 species (including 14 new species described in this revision). Three genera (Clavisodalis, Echinirus, and Echinosocius) live in the esophagi of sea urchins. Eleven genera (the type genus Taeniacanthus, Anchistrotos, Cirracanthus, Irodes, Metataeniacanthus, Nudisodalis, Phagus, Pseudotaeniacanthus, Scolecicara, Taeniacanthodes, and Taeniastrotos) are parasites of marine fishes. Parataeniacanthus is placed in synonomy with Taeniacanthus, and two new genera (Cirracanthus and Nudisodalis) are described. Keys are provided for all taeniacanthid genera and species parasitic on fishes (keys to the species of the genera associated with echinoids are found elsewhere).A descriptive account of the external morphology of this family is given. The detailed morphology of the general habitus, rostral area, first and second antennae, postantennal process, oral appendages, and legs is discussed in relation to their taxonomic significance.The first record of aggregative behavior of a poecilostome copepod is reported. Individuals of Taeniacanthodes gracilis form a cluster on the fins of their host, Paralichthys squamilentus. The individuals are arranged in single-file or a staggered pattern.Taeniacanthids exhibit a high degree of host specificity at both the generic and specific levels. Host-parasite relationships between taeniacanthids and tetraodontiform fishes are discussed.The known zoogeographic distribution suggests that the greatest diversity in genera and species of taeniacanthids occurs in the Indo-West Pacific. Taeniacanthus is the most ubiquitous genus, but more extensive collections for taeniacanthids must be made before conclusions on the distribution of these copepods can be reached.Phylogenetic relationships within the bomolochiform complex, comprised of the Bomolochidae, Taeniacanthidae, and Tuccidae, are discussed. The Tuccidae is considered the most derived family. The Bomolochidae and Taeniacanthidae have a mosaic of plesiomorphic and apomorphic characters. A phylogenetic analysis must be done before conclusions can be made concerning familial relationships. The relationship of the Telsidae to the complex is discussed.Host-parasite and parasite-host lists are included. Scanning electron micrographs of selected species are provided to augment the line drawings.

T1  - The Significance of Body Size, Dispersal Potential, and Habitat for Rates of Morphological Evolution in Stomatopod Crustacea

N2  - This study reviews the world-wide distribution and status of all families and genera of stomatopod Crustacea, and tests a number of hypotheses about factors that alter rates of morphological evolution of stomatopods from the Atlanto-East Pacific region. The degree of morphological divergence of lineages among geographic subregions (East Pacific, West Atlantic, East Atlantic) and the incidence of local species radiation is both inversely and highly significantly related to species body size. Similarly, postlarval size and dispersal potential are significantly and inversely related to morphological divergence among subregions; local species multiplication is especially highly correlated with small postlarvae and restricted dispersal. Our data suggest that speciation may be higher for taxa inhabiting reef and rock substrates than level bottoms; these taxa also experience greater competition for resources and exhibit more complex behavior than those from level bottoms. However, other environmental attributes, such as depth, temperature, and latitude, were consistently unrelated to measures of divergence and speciation. Although further study is needed, extinctions appear to be more common in the gonodactyloids than in the lysiosquilloids or squilloids, in taxa with small postlarvae and restricted dispersal, in lineages inhabiting coral reefs compared to level bottoms, in tropical versus temperate latitudes, and in the East Atlantic followed by the East Pacific and then the West Atlantic geographic subregions.

N2  - The genus Leptonema GuÃ©rin is revised, resulting in 105 species being recognized, 2 of which are composed of 2 subspecies each, 2 additional species being placed to species group only, and 2 more species remaining nomina dubia. We describe 48 species and 2 subspecies as new, and divide the genus into 15 new species groups. For the 105 species fully recognized, the male genitalia, and other selected characters, are figured, and known distributions mapped. The genus is known in the New World from southwestern United States to central Argentina, including the Greater and Lesser Antilles, and in the Old World from subsaharan Africa and Madagascar. The phylogenetic relationships of the genus are discussed and a phylogeny of the species groups proposed. The genus Neoleptonema is a new synonym of Leptonema and its sole species, aspersum Ulmer, is placed in the sparsum group (new combination). Macrostemum giganteum Martynov (new combination), from India is removed from Leptonema. The following 6 new synonymies are made: M. displicens NavÃ¡s under L. affine Ulmer; L. bihoumi Statzner and Gibon under L. guineense Gibbs; L. silvestrinum NavÃ¡s under L. columbianum Ulmer; L. grisolinum NavÃ¡s under L. crassum Ulmer; Hydropsyche trilobata Jacquemart under L. agraphum (Kolenati); and Hydropsyche flagellata Jacquemart under L. pallidum GuÃ©rin.

N2  - Accounts are presented of the ecology and behavior of four species of sand wasps belonging to the genus Bembix in Sri Lanka. All species prey upon adult Diptera and practice progressive provisioning.Bembix orientalis Handlirsch nests in sandy loam and makes a short, shallow, unicellular nest. The species is apparently a generalist, preying upon flies of various habits.Bembix glauca Fabricius nests in pure sand along the coast. It digs one of the longest and deepest nests on record, and is unique because its burrow has several abrupt angulations in contrast to the usual one slight angulation or none at all. Nests were found during an early stage and had only a single partially provisioned cell. The species may possibly build multicellular nests because of the burrow length and depth. This wasp preys upon flies attracted to domesticated animals.Bembix antoni, new species, nests in coarse riverine sand sometimes underlaid by sandy loam. It constructs a simple unicellular nest and uses as prey about two dozen flies that are attracted to filth or organic debris. An adult wasp emerged in the laboratory from a cocoon collected 11 months earlier, suggesting that the species may be univoltine.Bembix borrei Handlirsch nests in pure sand or sandy loam and also exploits piles of sand accumulated for building purposes, constructing a short, shallow, unicellular nest. This wasp is a generalist, preying upon flies found around domesticated animals, those attracted to filth or organic debris, and some that may have been visiting flowers.The revisionary section includes a key to differentiate the taxa occurring in Sri Lanka and South India, and synonymy, descriptions, locality data, and figures for each. A new species, antoni, is described from several localities in Sri Lanka and South India. A lectotype is designated for the closely related budha Handlirsch, an Indian species not known to occur in Sri Lanka. Bembix nigrocornuta Parker, 1929, and borrei thaiana Tsuneki, 1963, are synonymized with borrei Handlirsch, 1893, and a lectotype is designated for borrei.

N2  - Four papers resulting from the Bermuda "Ocean Acre" program are included in this volume. The data are from 14 cruises conducted between October 1967 and June 1972 to sample the midwater fauna of a roughly one-degree square centered at 32Â°N, 64Â°W. The first paper presents information that is pertinent to the entire volume, as well as to any future papers: nature and number of samples, kinds of gear, sampling strategy, treatment of samples, methods of analysis, explanation of terminology, and a general description of the oceanography of the study area. The other three papers present detailed treatment of the life histories and ecology of the species in three families of mesopelagic fishes: Sternoptychidae, the marine hatchetfishes and related species, with 7 species in 4 genera; Myctophidae, the lanternfishes, with 63 species in 18 genera; and Melamphaidae, the so-called bigscales, with 15 species in 4 genera. When data are sufficient, the accounts include descriptions, analyses, and proposed explanations (when appropriate) of size ranges of the developmental stages, sex ratio, life cycle and seasonal abundance, vertical distribution of each growth stage, stage and size stratification, presence or absence of vertical migratory behavior, patchiness of distribution, and differences in day versus night catch rates. All three papers consider the partitioning of resources among species in the treated family. The species and samples of Myctophidae were subjected to factor and cluster analyses by season, and the results are discussed in detail.

N2  - External morphology of aeglid "crabs," unusual freshwater anomuran decapods endemic to South America, is described in detail for common members of the genus Aegla from the Arroyo San Antonio in southern Uruguay. Comparisons are made with available species descriptions in the literature. General aeglid morphology resembles that of members of the marine family Galatheidae, with which aeglids are traditionally grouped in the superfamily Galatheoidea. Several morphological features distinguish aeglids from marine members of the Galatheoidea. Of special interest are branchial morphology and sutures of the carapace. The occurrence of characters similar to those seen in Aegla in non-galatheoid anomuran families casts doubt upon the presently accepted phylogenetic placement of the Aeglidae. The hypothesis that aeglids may be related to members of the Paguroidea is presented. A list of all species of the family is included.

N2  - A revision of the genus Alpheus revealed 53 nominal species reported from the eastern Pacific. Of these, 23 species are considered valid and an additional 21 new species are described, resulting in 44 eastern Pacific species. A key to all 44 species is provided. Forty-four species are described and 41 are illustrated. The species occur in a variety of habitats including coral (18 species), rocky intertidal (29 species), mangroves (3 species), and sand-mud (21 species). Most species occur in several habitats while a few (e.g., Alpheus lottini) are found only in a single habitat. Seventy-seven percent of the species are endemic to the eastern Pacific while 11% also occur on both coasts of the Atlantic. Five percent are shared with the Indo-West Pacific and 2% each with the western Atlantic, eastern Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific and all other tropical regions. Within the eastern Pacific, species of Alpheus occur as far north as Horseshoe Cave, Sonora County, California, and as far south as Puerto Montt, Chile. Twenty species occur in the Galapagos Islands of which only one is apparently endemic. The greatest number of species (33) is found in the subregion between about 12Â°N and 2Â°N (Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia) with the number decreasing north and south of this subregion.

N2  - Numerous bottom samples collected during 1971-1977 from the western half of the Beaufort Sea contained four species of myodocopid ostracodes, three new. The new species are described and illustrated, and a supplementary description is presented of Philomedes brenda (Baird, 1850) based on the specimens from the Beaufort Sea. The most abundant species is P. brenda, which is circumpolar. The new species are endemic to the Beaufort Sea. Of these Scleroconcha ruffi is common, and the remaining two are extremely rare (Empoulsenia monothrix and Bathyleberis thrix). Samples were collected at depths of 25-4200 m, but myodocopid ostracodes were not present deeper than 1926 m. Relative abundances of P. brenda and S. ruffi differed in August of the adjacent years 1976, 1977, at depths of 50-100 m, but not at depths of 25-40 m. Samples collected during October 1975, March, May, August, November 1976, and August 1977, suggest that P. brenda may be more abundant during March and May. Whether stations were with or without an ice cover seemed to have little effect on ostracode abundance. Females of both P. brenda and S. ruffi appear to bear eggs year-round. Species and genera between depths of 0-200 m (continental shelf and part of upper slope) in the Arctic and Antarctic are compared: Five of seven genera on the Arctic shelf also live on the Antarctic shelf (Simpson Index 71.4), but with no species in common. A hydrozoan colonizes the carapaces of some adult and ovigerous females of Philomedes brenda.Four other taxonomic actions not directly pertinent to this study are taken: Philomedes globosa digitiformis Chavtur, 1983, is raised to species rank as Philomedes digitiformis Chavtur; Asterope abyssicola Sars, 1869, is recombined as Prionotoleberis abyssicola (Sars), Asterope norvegica Sars, 1869, is recombined as Prionotoleberis norvegica (Sars), and Philomedes kadjakiensis Chavtur, 1893, is referred to Philomedes species inquirenda.

N2  - The internal oral anatomy of larvae from 34 genera (52 species) of leptodactyloid larvae are examined and described. These represent most of the South American leptodactylid genera plus Heleophryne from Africa and a sample of both myobatrachine and limnodynastine genera from Australia.Full descriptions are provided for at least one species of each genus and additional species comparisons are made as appropriate. Comparative synopses, which emphasize unique or unusual features, are also presented for each genus.In general, larval oral morphologies are distinctive at the generic level, but specific features correlate better with ecology than with phylogeny. Nevertheless, certain phylogenetic conclusions are possible based on the larval data, which are discussed in detail. Major evolutionary trends in leptodactyloid larval internal oral anatomy are discussed that involve elaboration or simplification of surface structures.

N2  - Seven new species, two representing the genus Pycnophyes and five species of Echinoderes, are described from the Arctic waters of West Greenland. Keys to the adults of both genera are included. To determine the diversity and relative abundance of the kinorhynch fauna, samples of subtidal sediment were collected along the long axes of Disko Bay and Disko Fjord at depths of 6.5 m to 300 m. One species was found at only a single locality; others were more widely distributed and most abundant in the more protected confines of the fjord or deeper water of the bay. No kinorhynchs were found in sediments directly affected by glacial meltwater. Accounts of the first five of six stages in the life history of one of the two species of Pycnophyes are included in the description of that species.

N2  - A diverse fauna of Arizona Hydrobiidae is documented as a result of recent collecting from numerous springs in the state. The fauna is composed of 14 species in two genera, Pyrgulopsis Call and Pilsbry and Tryonia Stimpson. Thirteen species are described as new herein and the fourteenth represents a new state record. All have relatively restricted distributions, and two are single-spring endemics. All congeners are allopatric to one another.Stepwise canonical discriminant function analyses using sets of shell and anatomical data confirmed the distinctiveness of the 12 species of Arizona Pyrgulopsis, as classification of (grouped) topotypes was 89%-93% using shell data, and 100% using anatomical data. Discriminant analyses also confirmed that differentiation among congeners largely involves male anatomy (especially penial features), as this data set yielded the best separation of species in plots of discriminant function scores.

N2  - Three species of Astronesthes having the highest serial-photophore counts (67-71 IC, 44-47 OA) and vertebral counts (60-63) in the genus, all occurring in the region of the southern Subtropical Convergence, are recognized. One species is associated with Cryptostomias psychrolutes Gibbs and Weitzman, 1965, which is redescribed. The genus Cryptostomias thereby becomes a synonym of Astronesthes. The other two species are described as new: A. kreffti and A. spatulifer. Both A. psychrolutes and A. kreffti occur in the Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and the eastern and/or western Pacific sectors of the Covergence region; A. spatulifer is known only from the central Pacific sector. Large specimens have distinctive patterns of pale luminous tissue on the operculum and body, and their barbels and barbel tips differ in length and conformation. Small specimens are more difficult to distinguish, but A. psychrolutes has 7 pectoral-fin rays (the other two species have 8 rays), and the barbel tip is short and flat in A. spatulifer, spheroidal or cylindrical in the other two. The so-called Subtropical Convergence distribution pattern is shown to be somewhat vague, partly because of differences in species distributions to the north and south of the Convergence, partly because few samples have been made in subtropical and subantarctic waters adjacent to the Convergence.

N2  - The Atlantic cryptochirids comprise four species in four different genera. One new species and three new genera are named. Troglocarcinus corallicola Verrill, 1908, shows an amphi-Atlantic distribution and is a generalist insofar as coral host is concerned. Pseudocryptochirus hypostegus Shaw and Hopkins, 1977, is assigned to a new genus, Opecarcinus, the only genus known in the Atlantic that also is represented in the Pacific. It ranges from the western Atlantic to Ascension Island and lives on agariciid and siderastreid corals. Troglocarcinus balssi Monod, 1956, is assigned to a new genus, Detocarcinus. It is restricted to the eastern Atlantic and lives on rhizangiid, oculinid, caryophyllid, and dendrophyllid corals. A new genus and species, Cecidocarcinus brychius, is named for specimens taken on dendrophyllid corals from the Valdivia Ridge, southeastern Atlantic, in 512 meters; it is the deepest occurring cryptochirid.

N2  - Vertebrate fossils collected from a limestone fissure filling BP, at Burma Quarry on Antigua, Lesser Antilles, are associated with radiocarbon dates ranging from 4300Â±150 to 2560Â±70 years BP, contemporaneous with the earliest aboriginal human occupation of the island. Four Amerindian lithic artifacts (two blades and two flakes) were collected within the same sediments. Two taxa of invertebrates and ten of vertebrates from Burma Quarry are either completely extinct or have not been recorded previously from Antigua. These species, which represent more than one-third of the total number of species represented as fossils, include the land crabs Cardisoma and Gecarcinus, the lizard Leiocephalus cuneus, the snakes Alsophis antillensis and an uncertain genus, possibly Boidae, the birds Puffinus lherminieri, Poliolimnas flaviventer, and Cinclocerthia ruficauda, the bats Pteronotus parnellii, Mormoops blainvillei, and Phyllonycteris major, and a rodent (Oryzomyini sp.). The extinction of these vertebrates occurred well after any major climatic changes of the late Pleistocene and are best attributed to the environmental influences of man over the past several millennia. Such biotic alterations have affected patterns of distribution and species diversity throughout the West Indies and other island groups. The faunal distinctions between the Greater and Lesser Antilles have been exaggerated by late Holocene extinctions in the northern Lesser Antilles. Ecological and biogeographical studies in the West Indies that consider only the historically known fauna are likely to be based upon data that do not completely reflect natural events.

A chronological synopsis of the family, genera, and species, as well as a summary of the general characteristics of the family are included. According to the present study, the family includes 8 genera and 46 species, of which 13 are described as new, as well as one doubtful subspecies. Particularly interesting features in this group include the gigantic sizes of the specimens, tube-dwelling habits and formation of tubes from parapodial spinning glands, the large stalked eyes or ommatophores, and large eversible pharynx or proboscis with denticled jaws and long papillae in connection with a carnivorous life style.

N2  - Ecsenius McCulloch is defined and its major specializations illustrated. It is not possible to propose its sister group unequivocally within the tribe Salariini.Ecsenius comprises 12 species groups, most hypothesized to be monophyletic based on a few heavily weighted characters; a few groups are possibly paraphyletic. The groups contain from one to nine species. Interrelationships of some groups, and some species within some groups, are hypothesized based on heavily weighted characters and/or distribution patterns.Ecsenius comprises 46 species, 20 here described as new. The new species are: E. aequalis (Great Barrier Reef; Trobriand Islands), E. alleni (Rowley Shoals and Scott Reef, Western Australia), E. australianus (Great Barrier Reef), E. axelrodi (Hermit Islands; New Britain; Solomon Islands), E. bathi (Java; Komodo), E. dentex (Gulf of Aqaba), E. dilemma (Philippines), E. fijiensis (Fiji: Viti Levu south to Vatoa, Lau Islands), E. kurti (Philippines), E. lubbocki (Phuket, Thailand, Indian Ocean), E. monoculus (Philippines; Ilot du Sud, Viet Nam; Moluccas), E. oculatus (Christmas Island, Indian Ocean; Western Australia), E. pardus (Fiji), E. paroculus (Phuket, Thailand; Malacca, Malaysia; Mentawei, Bawean, Seribu islands, Indonesia), E. portenoyi (Rotuma; American Samoa), E. sellifer (Umboi Island and Trobriand Islands, Papua New Guinea; Solomon Islands; Palau Islands), E. stictus (Great Barrier Reef), E. taeniatus (Basilaki and Goodenough islands, western Papua New Guinea), E. tessera (New Caledonia; New Hebrides), and E. tigris (Osprey and Bougainville reefs, Coral Sea). Ecsenius minutus Klausewitz, formerly synonymized with E. nalolo Smith, is resurrected. Several of the species have two or three strikingly different color-pattern forms, which are not associated with size or sex.A key is given to all species, all are illustrated in black-and-white halftones, and most are illustrated live in color photographs. Distribution maps are provided for all the species groups and species.Of the 12 species groups, all the species within each of five groups, containing from three to nine species, are allopatric. Two of these five groups, one with five and one with eight species, are hypothesized to form a clade. Of the 13 species in this clade, 12 are allopatric. One of the five species in one group is broadly sympatric with six of the eight species in the other group. The overall distribution of the two groups, and the distributions of the species in each of them, are used as the basis for a speculative vicariance biogeographic discussion, in which the tectonic history of India is proposed as the primary physical barrier that isolated biotas in the western Indian Ocean and allowed them to diverge.Species within a group usually exhibit sharply delimited distributions with respect to each other. For instance, one species of a group may have an extremely broad distribution with islandless voids of hundreds of kilometers separating its populations. Populations of the same species, however, may be separated from populations of another species in the same group at other islands by distances of only a few tens of kilometers. Such distribution patterns appear to be better explained by the tectonic history of the pertinent areas than by dispersal.

Seventeen species are reported from abyssal depths (below 2000 m), and 13 species are reported from bathyal depths (200-2000 m). All benthic species collected below 3480 m were blind, which is close to the depth of 3775 m previously reported for species in southern oceans (Kornicker, 1975a:48). Specimens collected extend northward the known ranges of the genera: Hadacypridina Paulson, 1962, Metavargula Kornicker, 1970, and Paradoloria Hanai, 1974.Three species not included in the study area are presented in the text for purposes of comparison.

N2  - Cave deposits in New Caledonia have produced fossils of 32 species of nonpasserine birds. Of these, 11 are extinct and known only as fossils. The giant galliform Sylviornis neocaledoniae is the only one of these to have been described previously. The following new species are described herein: Accipiter efficax, Accipiter quartus, Megapodius molistructor, Caloenas canacorum, Gallicolumba longitarsus, Tyto? letocarti, Porphyrio kukwiedei, Rhynochetos orarius. Two additional resident species, Ninox cf. N. novaeseelandiae and Coenocorypha? sp., and one migrant species, Charadrius mongolus, are new to the island. Five genera, Megapodius, Caloenas, Gallicolumba, Ninox, and Coenocorypha?, are new to the avifauna of New Caledonia. Abundant recent fossils of Turnix are smaller than T. varia from Australia or fossils from older deposits in New Caledonia. Several bones, including juveniles, of Anas gracilis are smaller than in a good series of skeletons from Australia and may represent an extinct resident population. Most of the fossils come from late Holocene deposits nearly or quite contemporaneous with the arrival of man in New Caledonia and most or all of the extinctions observed probably resulted from human disturbance.

Danielopolina mexicana is described from two specimens from the the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. This brings the number of known Danielopolina species to five; a revised key to the genus is included. The description of D. bahamensis includes the first for a male of the genus.Two new halocyprids are also described: Deeveya jillae, based on three specimens from Eleuthera, the Bahamas (bringing the number of known species of Deeveya to three); and a new subspecies, Euconchoecia bifurcata pax, based on 77 specimens from Koror Island, Palau.Ontogeny is described for those taxa with sufficient specimens: Danielopolina bahamensis and E. bifurcata pax. D. bahamensis probably has five growth stages. E. bifurcata pax has seven. The first instar of each of these two species has five pairs of appendages (first and second antennae, mandible, maxilla, and fifth limb) in addition to a furca.

Additional characters in a subset of these systems are congruent with the hypothesis of a sister group relationship between the Curimatidae and Prochilodontidae (Vari, 1983). Shared derived characters of those systems and the antorbital, infraorbitals, opercular apparatus, ligamentum primordiale, hypural complex, caudal-fin rays, proximal pterygiophores of the dorsal fin, laterosensory canal systems of the head and body, and squamation define phylogenetic subunits of the Curimatidae, supporting a phylogenetic hypothesis of four sequential dichotomies and a terminal polychotomy.I recognize eight genera in the Curimatidae. Curimatopsis, Potamorhina, Curimata, Psectrogaster, Steindachnerina, Pseudocurimata, and Curimatella are each hypothesized as monophyletic on the basis of additional shared derived characters. No unique derived characters were found to define the eighth recognized genus, Cyphocharax.Curimatichthys FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948) is a synonym of Curimatopsis. Potamorhina is redefined to include Gasterotomus Eigenmann (1910), Gasterostomus FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), Suprasinelepichthys FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), and Potamorrhina Braga and Azpelicueta (1983). Curimata Bosc (1817) has nine junior synonyms: Semitapicis Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889b); Peltapleura Fowler (1906); Acuticurimata Fowler (1941); Allenina FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948); Lambepiedra FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948); Bitricarinatra FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948); Bondichthys Whitley (1953); Stupens Whitley (1954); and Semitapiscis Braga and Azpilicueta (1983). Three genera are included in Psectrogaster: Pseudopsectrogaster FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), Hamatichthys FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), and Semelcarinata FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948). Rivasella and Curimatorbis, both proposed by FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), are synonyms of Steindachnerina Fowler (1906). Curimatella has three junior synonyms, all described by FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948): Apolinarella, Walbaunina, and Lepipinna. Cyphocharax has four synonyms: Xyrocharax Fowler (1913b), Hemicurimata Myers (1929), Curimatoides Fowler (1940), and Cruxentina FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948).The hypothesis of intrafamilial phylogenetic relationships described herein is incongruent, to differing degrees, with classificatory schemes proposed by Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889b), Eigenmann (1910), Fowler (1975), and GÃ©ry (1977b). Numerous differences exist at all taxonomic levels between the scheme of relationships proposed in this study and the "phylogenetic tree" put forward by FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948). Additional hypothesized derived characters described herein are in agreement with the reassignment of Anodus Spix, 1829 (in Spix and Agassiz, 1829) and Eigenmannina Fowler (1906) from the Curimatidae to the Hemiodontidae, first proposed by Roberts (1974) and congruent with results of Vari (1983).Homoplasious characters are discussed in terms of their overall taxonomic distributions, and relative to their innovative versus reductive natures. Reductive features involving the degree of development of the laterosensory canal system were found to be convergent between Curimatopsis and a subset of Cyphocharax. These paedomorphic features are evidently a consequence of the relative size reduction of these species compared to proximate outgroups.

N2  - The genus Smicridea McLachlan is characterized for its adult, larval, and pupal stages, and the species found in the Chilean Subregion are revised.Fourteen species are recognized in the subgenus Smicridea. These are placed in three species groups, with two additional species left unassigned. The S. annulicornis species group includes six species: annulicornis (Blanchard) (Rhyacophylax chilensis NavÃ¡s, new synonym); decora (NavÃ¡s) (Antarctopsyche annulicornis Ulmer and A. albescens NavÃ¡s, new synonyms); manzanara, new species; penai, new species; pucara, new species; and tregala, new species. The S. frequens species group includes four species: anticura, new species; frequens (NavÃ¡s); mucronata, new species; and turgida, new species. The S. smilodon species group includes two species: redunca, new species; and smilodon, new species. Smicridea complicatissima, new species, and S. matancilla, new species, are not assigned to a species group.The subgenus Rhyacophylax contains only a single species in the Chilean Subregion. S. murina McLachlan, with Rhyacophylax magnus Ulmer, R. mendocensis NavÃ¡s, and Smicridea (R.) zanclophora Flint as new synonyms.Descriptions, figures of males and females, distribution maps, and keys are included for all recognized species of Smicridea of the Chilean Subregion (except for females of S. complicatissima and S. matancilla, which are unknown). The possible relationships of the Chilean members of Smicridea are discussed, and the morphological similarities of members of the S. frequens species group to the Australian genera Asmicridea and Smicrophylax are noted.

N2  - The genus Curimata Bosc (1817) is recognized as a monophyletic subunit of the family Curimatidae on the basis of a variety of synapomorphies in the gill arches, buccopharyngeal complex, and palatine arch. Derived modifications of the gill arches, hyoid apparatus, opercular apparatus, maxilla, hyomandibula, palatine arch, supraneurals, first proximal pterygiophore of the dorsal fin, pigmentation, body form, squamation, degree of development of dorsal- and caudal-fin rays, number of vertebrae, and morphometrics unite groups of species within the genus.Curimata is redefined and twelve species are recognized in the genus. These are Curimata cyprinoides Linneaus (1766), distributed in the lower RÃ­o Orinoco, Atlantic drainages of the Guianas, lower Rio Amazonas and Rio Tocantins; C. vittata Kner (1859) of the Rio Amazonas system; C. aspera GÃ¼nther (1868a) of the upper Rio Amazonas; C. knerii Steindachner (1877) of the middle and upper Rio Amazonas; C. mivartii Steindachner (1878) endemic to the RÃ­o Magdalena and associated rivers; C. ocellata Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) distributed in the Rio Amazonas basin; C. macrops Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) known only from the Rio Parnaiba drainage basin of northeastern Brazil; C. cisandina (Allen, in Eigenmann and Allen, 1942) found in the Rio Amazonas system; C. cerasina Vari (1984b), a RÃ­o Orinoco endemic; C. incompta Vari (1984b) of the RÃ­o Orinoco basin; C. inornata, a new species from the Rio Amazonas system; and C. roseni, a new species from the Rio Negro drainage basin.Curimatus semitaeniatus of Steindachner (1917) was found to be based on a juvenile of Curimata ocellata Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) and is placed as a synonym of the latter species. Curimata murieli described by Allen (in Eigenmann and Allen, 1942) has as its holotype a juvenile of Curimata vittata Kner (1859) and the two species are considered conspecific. Lambepiedra alleni of FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948) is placed as a synonym of Curimata cisandina Allen (in Eigenmann and Allen, 1942). Curimatus simulatus proposed by Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) is considered to be a synonym of Curimata aspera GÃ¼nther (1868a). Salmo edentulus Bloch (1794), Charax planirostris Gray (1854), Curimatus schomburgkii GÃ¼nther (1864), and Curimata copei Fowler (1906) are placed as synonyms of Curimata cyprinoides Linnaeus (1766). Salmo immaculatus Linnaeus (1758), the oldest name for the species herein termed Curimata cyprinoides, is not available (International Commission for Zoological Nomenclature, 1966).Contrary to the conclusions of many earlier studies, Semitapicis of Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) is placed as a synonym of Curimata Bosc (1817) rather than being retained as a distinct genus. The genera Acuticurimata Fowler (1941), Allenina FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), Bitricarinata FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), Bondichthys Whitley (1953), Lambepiedra FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948), Peltapleura Fowler (1906), and Stupens Whitley (1954) are also placed as synonyms of Curimata.The historical zoogeography of the species of Curimata is discussed. The genus is hypothesized to have undergone most of its species-level divergence prior to the final uplift of the Andes. The degree of sympatry between sister clades within Curimata indicates that there has been a significant degree of post-vicariance dispersal within the genus.

N2  - Ostracoda in the suborders Myodocopina (4 species in 4 genera: Parasterope muelleri (Skogsberg, 1920), Rutidermata sterreri Kornicker, 1981, Pseudophilomedes kylix, new species, and Sarsiella styx, new species), Cladocopina (4 species in 3 genera: Metapolycope duplex, new species, Micropolycope eurax, new species, M. styx, new species, and Polycopissa anax, new species), and Halocypridina (Spelaeoecia bermudensis Angel and Iliffe, 1987) from anchialine caves in the Bermuda Islands are described and illustrated. Two species of Cladocopina and the single species of Halocypridina are interpreted as troglobitic, 1 species of Cladocopina and 2 of Myodocopina are interpreted as troglophilic, and 1 species of Cladocopina and 2 of Myodocopina are interpreted as accidental cave inhabitants. Accidental inhabitants, few in number, are mostly in caves having strong to moderate currents close to the coast; troglophilic species are fairly abundant in caves with moderate currents close to the coast, and also in caves having weak currents farther from the coast; troglobites inhabit isolated caves without currents usually farther from the coast. A new locality (Jane's Cave) is reported for the troglobitic halocyprid ostracode Spelaeoecia bermudensis Angel and Iliffe, 1987. It is concluded that Pseudophilomedes kylix has 4 juvenile instars, Metapolycope duplex has 6, and Polycopissa anax has 5. The first instar of Cladocopina has 5 appendages, the same number as on the adult (first and second antennae, mandible, maxilla, and fifth limb). The male is described for the first time for the myodocopid Eusarsiella absens (Kornicker, 1981), collected from Harrington Sound, Bermuda. Specimens from the continental shelves of North America (Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico) that had previously been referred to Pseudophilomedes ferulanus Kornicker, 1958, are described as a new species, Pseudophilomedes darbyi.

T1  - The Avifauna of the Cayerias of Southern Cuba, with the Ornithological Results of the Paul Bartsch Expedition of 1930

N2  - The systematics and distribution of the avifauna of the numerous small islands scattered along the southern coast of Cuba are analyzed and discussed using a previously unstudied collection made by Paul Bartsch in 1930 and reports in the literature. Estimates of eustatic sea-level change indicate that this avifauna is no older than mid- to late Pleistocene, as the islands were doubtless submerged during earlier Pleistocene sea-level maxima. The cays were colonized from Cuba over water gaps at different times since their last emergence and over broad land connections probably during the Wisconsinan glacial age to as recently as âˆ¼8000 years ago.The avifauna is a depauperate sample of that of the Cuban mainland, comprising 28 species of resident land birds. Twenty-three (82%) of these are widely distributed elsewhere in the Antillean-Bahaman region. Only 3 (11%) of the 28 species are confined to the Cuban region: Xiphidiopicus percussus, Vireo gundlachii, Teretistris fernandinae. For the small scrub and mangrove covered islands in the Golfo de Guacanayabo, 8 of the 9 resident species (89%) are widespread. The occurrence of 25 species of land birds on Cayo Cantiles (the largest number on any island of the southern cayerias), in contrast to only 17 on the larger island of Cayo Largo, reflects the importance of habitat diversity over island area in determining species richness. Both islands have reasonably well-known avifaunas.No species is endemic to the cayerias, but five have differentiated at the subspecific level within the islands: the woodpeckers Melanerpes superciliaris and Xiphidiopicus percussus, the flycatcher Contopus caribaeus, the vireo Vireo gundlachii, and the blackbird Agelaius humeralis. Populations of two other species, the thrush Turdus plumbeus and the grackle Quiscalus niger, appear to represent relict forms that have been largely replaced by other subspecies on mainland Cuba. Several puzzling patterns of distribution include the presence of Agelaius humeralis on Cayo Cantiles and in the Jardines de la Reina and its absence on the much larger Isle of Pines; the absence of the dove Columbina passerina from the Jardines de la Reina; and the absence of the flycatcher Tyrannus caudifasciatus from Los Canarreos.

N2  - The genus Psectrogaster Eigenmann and Eigenmann is shown to constitute a monophyletic subunit of the family Curimatidae. A number of shared derived characters of the first to fourth epibranchials, fifth upper pharyngeal tooth-plate, and first infrapharyngobranchial unite these species as a natural lineage within the family Curimatidae. Modifications of various gill-arch components, body form, squamation, body pigmentation and anal-fin ray numbers delimit monophyletic subunits of the genus.Eight species are recognized in the genus: Psectrogaster ciliatus (MÃ¼ller and Troschel, 1845) which occurs in the Essequibo River, the RÃ­o Orinoco and the Rio Amazonas system; P. rutiloides (Kner, 1859a) widely distributed in the Rio Amazonas basin; P. essequibensis (GÃ¼nther, 1864) found in the Essequibo River and the Rio Amazonas basins; P. rhomboides Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889a) limited to the Rio Parnaiba and Rio Jaguariba of northeastern Brazil; P. amazonica Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889a) widely distributed in the Rio Amazonas drainage basin; P. falcata (Eigenmann and Eigenmann, 1889b) of the Rio Amazonas system; P. curviventris Eigenmann and Kennedy (1907) known from the RÃ­o Paraguay and southern portions of the Rio Madeira system; and P. saguiru (Fowler, 1941) from the rivers of northeastern Brazil.Psectrogaster essequibensis (GÃ¼nther) considered a synonym of P. ciliatus (MÃ¼ller and Troschel) by Eigenmann (1912) and subsequent authors is recognized as a distinct species. Curimatus isognathus Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889b) and Psectrogaster auratus Gill (1895) are synonymized under P. rutiloides (Kner). Curimata pearsoni Myers (1929) is tentatively placed as a synonym of Psectrogaster curviventris Eigenmann and Kennedy. Psectrogaster rhomboides australe Risso and Sanchez (1964) is considered a synonym of P. curviventris. The genera Pseudopsectrogaster, Hamatichthys, and Semelcarinata, all proposed by FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948) are placed as synonyms of Psectrogaster Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889a).Citations of the presence of Psectrogaster rutiloides in the RÃ­o Paraguay basin by authors commencing with Boulenger (1896) were found to be based on misidentifications of Psectrogaster curviventris. Perugia's report of Curimatus ciliatus from the RÃ­o ParanÃ¡ system was similarly a consequence of an incorrect identification of Psectrogaster curviventris.The historical zoogeography of the species of Psectrogaster is discussed. A significant degree of post-vicariance dispersal is obvious at more inclusive phylogenetic levels, but is less pronounced between sister species. A pattern of repeated sister-species relationships between the rivers of northeastern Brazil and the Amazon basin is noted.

N2  - Eighty-eight species of decapod crustaceans were collected from the Panama Canal. Seven of these were previously undescribed (Macrobrachium crebrum, new species, M. digitus, new species, Synalpheus recessus, new species, S. superus, new species, Eurypanopeus canalensis, new species, Panopeus gatunensis, new species, and P. mirafloresensis, new species), and another five were known only from one or a few records. Approximately 27 of the species occurred in fresh water (including one introduced from Iraq), 31 in euryhaline conditions, and 30 in almost marine conditions. Thirty species were collected from the Miraflores Third Locks Lake area and spillway (6-30â€°), 23 species from the lower locks (10-30â€°), and 25 species from the upper locks (0-5â€°) of the Miraflores Locks. Twelve species were collected from the fresh water of the Pedro Miguel Locks and an equal number from freshwater streams on Barro Colorado Island. The Gatun Locks yielded four species from the freshwater upper locks, eight from the 2-8â€° waters of the middle locks, and 22 from the 8-15â€° waters of the lower locks. A typical marine assemblage of species occurred down to about 10â€°, whereas a typical freshwater fauna occurred up to about 3â€°; a species-minimum zone was observed from about 3 to 5â€°.There has been relatively little exchange between the Atlantic and Pacific regions. Seven Atlantic species (one freshwater and six euryhaline species) were collected from the Pacific side and one Pacific euryhaline species from the Atlantic side. Most of the Atlantic migrants were collected from the Miraflores Third Locks Lake area and apparently have not established breeding populations outside of the Panama Canal. Surprisingly, only one of the 27 freshwater species has spread throughout the canal. The fresh water of Gatun Lake forms an effective barrier to the distribution of stenohaline marine species, and therefore any salinization of Gatun Lake (or construction of a sea-level canal) would almost certainly result in an extensive faunal exchange and would be unconscionable given our ignorance of the biota and ecology of the communities of the Panama Canal.

N2  - Two new species, Skogsbergia galapagensis and Danielopolina styx, are described from 3 anchialine pools (grietas) in fissures on the south coast of Santa Cruz Island, Galapagos Islands. Skogsbergia galapagensis is the first known troglobitic Cypridinidae. Danielopolina styx is the first troglobitic Danielopolina from the Pacific, and the fifth troglobite in the genus to be described. The ontogeny of both species is described, and the ontogeny of S. galapagensis is compared to that of S. lerneri, an open sea, shallow water Atlantic form, and found to be similar.

N2  - The morphology and ontogeny of the female copulatory organs in American Pisauridae were analyzed in order to formulate a groundplan of the female copulatory organs and to define homologous features. Decisions on homology were based on criteria of relative position, morphological similarity, and ontogenetic evidence. The existing literature on the ontogeny of female copulatory organs in spiders is reviewed. Based on data obtained through the present study, the evolution of the female copulatory organs in entelegyne spiders is discussed.

N2  - The osteology of the rarely collected epipelagic fish Luvarus imperialis Rafinesque, the louvar, is redescribed, based for the first time on cleared and stained specimens of juveniles and young adults, as well as on dried skeletons of larger adults. Knowledge of the structure of fossil luvarids, from their first occurrence in the upper Paleocene to a very well-preserved specimen from the lower Eocene, is reviewed and their status re-evaluated. Earlier comparative anatomical studies are reviewed in historical perspective with regard to previously proposed relationships. It has been postulated most frequently that Luvarus is related to carangoid or scombroid fishes, the latter hypothesis having been the most widely accepted. With cladistic methodology and with much additional detailed information on the osteology and larval morphology of Luvarus and other groups, the carangoid and scombroid hypotheses are refuted. Luvarus is actually a highly specialized pelagic member of the typically reef-associated Acanthuroidei, the surgeon fishes and their allies. Scatophagids and ephippidids, respectively, are the first and second outgroups for the Acanthuroidei. Anatomical diagnoses of all acanthuroid genera are given. A cladistic analysis of the intra-relationships of the Acanthuroidei, based on 90 characters encompassing both larval and adult morphology, provides a highly corroborated hypothesis indicating the following phyletic sequence: Siganidaeâ€”Luvaridaeâ€”Zanclidaeâ€”Acanthuridae.

N2  - Fifty-three species of ahermatypic Scleractiniaâ€”about half of the Philippine ahermatypic faunaâ€”belonging to four families and one subfamily are described and illustrated. Five additional species found in adjacent waters just north of the Philippines are also included in the faunistic revision. In order to better evaluate the genus Leptopenus, L. antarcticus, from Antarctica, is also included in this revision as a new species, making a total of 59 species revised. Concurrent with the species revision, higher-level taxa were reanalyzed and revised, resulting in the description of four new genera: Endocyathopora, Thrypticotrochus, Truncatoguynia, and Truncatoflabellum and 17 new species; the formation of 13 new species combinations; and the establishment of two new subgeneric ranks: Fungiacyathus (Bathyactis) and Flabellum (Ulocyathus). To help stabilize the nomenclature of taxonomically confusing species, neotypes were designated for two species: Flabellum (= Truncatoflabellum) cumingii and Flabellum (= Truncatoflabellum) candeanum; and lectotypes were chosen for four other species: Bathyactis (= Fungiacyathus) sibogae, Flabellum pavoninum, Flabellum distinctum, and Flabellum patens. Approximately 4400 specimens were examined from 178 stations throughout the Philippines, as well as most of the previously reported specimens from this area. A historical resume is given of previous literature on ahermatypic Scleractinia in the Philippine Islands. Character tables or keys are provided for the genera of Micrabaciidae, Turbinoliinae, Guyniidae, and Flabellidae, and character tables are provided for the Philippine species of Fungiacyathus, Stephanophyllia, Flabellum (Flabellum), and Truncatoflabellum.The Philippine Islands and Indonesia, especially the Sulu Sea, are considered to be at or near the center of ahermatypic species diversity and thus represent the most diverse ahermatypic fauna in the world. East and west of the Philippines the number of species held in common falls rapidly, but relatively high percentages of shared species are found to the north: 30%-32% for the South China Sea off Hong Kong, and 36%-38% for off Japan. The highest number of shared species, however, is with Indonesia (25-27 species, 47%-51%), with which the Philippines probably forms a zoogeographic unit. Of the 53 species reported from the Philippines, 27 are new records for this island group.

Three species of Ceratothoa and four species of Glossobius are reported from the mouths of four species of flying fishes and six species of halfbeaks, as follows: Ceratothoa angulata from the Philippines (no host) and Borneo (on Hyporhamphus dussumieri (Valenciennes, 1846)); C. guttata from the Philippines (on "flying fish"), the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia, Taiwan, and Madagascar (on Parexocoetus brachypterus (Richardson, 1846)); C. retusa from Mozambique (no host), Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia (on Hemiramphus robustus GÃ¼nther, 1866), Cobourg Peninsula, Northern Territory, Australia (on Hemiramphus far (ForsskÃ¥l, 1775)), West Irian (on H. far), and Durban, South Africa (on H. far); Glossobius anctus, new species, from Western Australia, New South Wales, Hawaii, and Japan (on Euleptorhamphus viridis (van Hasselt, 1823)); G. auritus from the Bahamas and the Caribbean (on Cypselurus comatus (Mitchill, 1815)), tropical eastern Pacific (no host), Japan (on Cypselurus agoo (Temminck and Schlegel, 1854)), "Ost Indien" (no host), and Thailand (on Cypselurus sp.); G. hemiramphi from Georgia, Florida, the Bahamas, the Caribbean, the west coast of Africa from Dakar, Senegal, to Luanda, Angola (all on Hemiramphus brasiliensis (Linnaeus, 1758)), and Bermuda (on Hemiramphus bermudensis Collette, 1962); G. impressa, western Atlantic from New Jersey to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but not in the Caribbean, and eastern Atlantic from Dakar, Senegal, to off Angola at 10Â°48'S (host not identified except 1 record from Hirundichthyes speculiger (Valenciennes, 1846)). All 7 isopod species are described and illustrated in detail, and a key is given to the species of Glossobius. Cteatessa and Rhexanella are reduced to synonyms of Ceratothoa. Ceratothoa hemiramphi and C. venusta are placed in synonymy with C. retusa and C. guttata, respectively. Glossobius albinae is considered a junior synonym of G. auritus.Glossobius hemiramphi has two disjunct populations, a western Atlantic population ranging from Georgia to the Yucatan Peninsula and in the Caribbean; a west African coastal population ranging from Dakar, Senegal, to Luanda, Angola. Western Atlantic specimens are distinctly longer than those from West Africa.

N2  - The genus Pseudocurimata FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948) is redefined as a monophyletic subunit of the characiform family Curimatidae. Shared derived features in the position of the first proximal radial pterygiophore of the dorsal fin relative to the neural spines of the anterior vertebrae, the form of the anterior and medial articular surfaces of the second hypobranchial, and the pronounced reduction or complete loss of the second set of uroneurals define Pseudocurimata as a monophyletic lineage. Derived conditions of the second hypobranchial, fourth ceratobranchial, second set of uroneurals, position of the first proximal pterygiophore of the dorsal fin, number of vertebrae, and pigmentation characterize monophyletic clades within the genus or are autapomorphic for species. Pseudocurimata is unique among the genera recognized by Vari (1989) in being endemic to the rivers of the western versant of the Andes.Six species are recognized in Pseudocurimata: P. troschelii (GÃ¼nther, 1859), which inhabits the rivers draining into the Gulf of Guayaquil in southwestern Ecuador, and the RÃ­o Zarumilla and RÃ­o Tumbes of northwestern Peru; P. boulengeri (Eigenmann in Eigenmann and Ogle, 1907), which occurs in the rivers in southwestern Ecuador draining into the northern portions of the Gulf of Guayaquil; P. lineopunctata (Boulenger, 1911) of the RÃ­o San Juan, RÃ­o Dagua, and upper RÃ­o Atrato in western Colombia, and the coastal rivers of northern Ecuador; P. patiae (Eigenmann in Eigenmann, Henn, and Wilson, 1914) known only from the RÃ­o Patia in southwestern Colombia; P. peruana (Eigenmann, 1920a) of the RÃ­o Chira and RÃ­o Piura in northwestern Peru; and P. boehlkei, a new species from the RÃ­o Esmeraldas basin and possibly the RÃ­o Santiago system of northwestern Ecuador.Curimatus brevipes Eigenmann and Ogle (1907) described on the basis of a specimen originating from an uncertain, possibly Peruvian, locality, and Curimatus aureus Pellegrin (1908) described from specimens collected in the RÃ­o Guayas basin of Ecuador, are both placed as synonyms of Pseudocurimata troschelii. Citations of the occurrence of Curimatus patiae in the coastal rivers of northwestern Peru and those of Curimatus peruanus from the Amazon drainages of Ecuador were misidentifications.The historical zoogeography of the species of Pseudocurimata is discussed. The hypothesis of intrageneric phylogenetic relationships is congruent with a scheme of sequential north to south vicariance events along the western versant of the Andes in northwestern South America. The majority of the species in the genus have discrete allopatric distributions, with some degree of secondary, post-vicariance, dispersal evident in the rivers draining into the northern portions of the Gulf of Guayaquil in the southwest of Ecuador, and possibly in the RÃ­o Santiago system of northwestern Ecuador.

T1  - Social, Sexual, and Pseudosexual Behavior of the Blue-bellied Roller, Coracias cyanogaster: The Consequences of Crowding or Concentration

N2  - Blue-bellied Rollers (Coracias cyanogaster) occur in West Africa. They are typical of Coracias species in being sit-and-wait predators. They pounce upon relatively large prey (arthropods and vertebrates) in low, sparse vegetation or on bare ground. They differ from their closest relatives, other species of the same genus, in preferring humid or semi-humid habitats. In West Africa, such habitats are naturally forested. Blue-bellied Rollers often perch high in trees. Still, they prefer to pounce low. This means, in effect, that they are dependent upon clearings to some appreciable and significant extent. Patches of bare earth and sparse vegetation probably were few and scattered before the spread of agriculture. In these earlier circumstances, Blue-bellied Rollers must have had to concentrate upon whatever open spaces were available. They may have been more crowded on a restricted local level than other species of rollers.All Coracias are large, powerful, and aggressive. Concentration and crowding must have been difficult to manage or to support. The ancestors of modern Blue-bellied Rollers would seem to have evolved several behavioral mechanisms to cope with their problem. They may have become more tolerant of conspecifics than their relatives. In the Basse Casamance region of SÃ©nÃ©gal and perhaps other areas, they have also developed the habit, unique among rollers, of performing pseudocopulations, reverse mountings, sometimes with apparent cloacal contacts, sometimes repeatedly. Sexually-derived patterns are potentially capable of being used to control agonistic encounters irrespective of actual sex. They seem to do so in two ways. They can function as threat. They also canalize aggression to minimize the risks of contact fighting with neighbors and intruders.Adaptations to forested conditions have survived, even though much of the land has been largely cleared for centuries or perhaps thousands of years.

N2  - Blenniid fishes of the genus Scartichthys Jordan and Evermann comprise a group of marine shore fishes restricted to the tropical and subtropical coasts of western Panama and western South America. Scartichthys comprises four species: S. crapulatus, new species (northern Chile and vicinity of Valparaiso), S. gigas (Panama to northern Chile), S. variolatus (San Felix, San Ambrosio, and Juan Fernandez Islands), and S. viridis (vicinity of Valparaiso to southern Peru). The four species are quite similar ecologically in being herbivores and detritivores, and inhabiting rocky areas.The salariin genera Cirripectes Swainson, Scartichthys, Exallias Jordan and Evermann, Ophioblennius Gill, Pereulixia Smith, Stanulus Smith, Entomacrodus Gill, and Istiblennius Whitley form a monophyletic group within the tribe Salariini. My hypothesized phylogeny indicates that each of the following genera is the sister genus to the combination of all preceding genera: Scartichthys, Ophioblennius, Cirripectes, Exallias, Pereulixia, Stanulus, Entomacrodus, and Istiblennius (including at least the I. gibbifrons species complex).

N2  - A survey was conducted on the histology and functional morphology of dermal structures (dermal cushions or "scales" and tubercles) of 10 species in 6 families of oceanic squids using SEM and light microscopy. Specific differences in connective tissue and cartilaginous tissue types were noted. Cartilages reminiscent of elastic cartilage and fibrocartilage of vertebrates are reported in cephalopods, one of the few such reports in invertebrates. Hyaline cartilaginous tubercles also are present. Functions hypothesized for dermal structures based on structural analysis and biology of the species include two dermal buoyancy mechanisms, like buoyancy vests, and a locomotory mechanism suggested for reducing hydrodynamic drag. Comparative morphology of dermal structures permitted reassessment of systematic relationships in Lepidoteuthis, Pholidoteuthis, and Tetronychoteuthis.

N2  - The higher level cladistic structure of cribellate spiders (Araneomorphae) and ontogenetic evidence relevant to the homology of sclerites in the male spider palp are reviewed, with the aim of clarifying orb-weaver phylogeny. The habitual use of a small set of terms for rather different palpal structures seems to have obscured homologies and therefore the monophyly of groups. Outgroup comparison of palp structure in various cribellate superfamilies (e.g., Dictynoidea and Amaurobioidea) can be used to polarize characters in orb-weaving spiders (Orbiculariae), and palp structure in Deinopoidea to polarize palp characters in Araneoidea. Results are that the radix of Linyphiidae and Araneidae may be synapomorphic, but the "radix" in such families as Oecobiidae, Uloboridae, and Theridiidae is in each case an autapomorphy of those taxa. The "terminal apophysis" in lycosoid taxa is entirely different from that in Araneoidea, and even within Araneoidea "terminal apophyses" in Theridiidae, Araneidae, and Tetragnathidae apparently are not homologous. On the other hand, possession of a median apophysis is probably primitive for Araneoidea. Problems surrounding the use of the terms "median apophysis" and "conductor" for various uloborid sclerites are discussed. A tentative cladogram of 32 orbicularian taxa, based on 87 binary and multistate characters, is presented.

This genus contains some of the most common, widespread, and nomenclaturally confused species of eumaeine butterflies.A provisional Thereus Section of the Eumaeini consists of Rekoa, Thereus, Arawacus, Contrafacia, and an undescribed genus. Rekoa, Thereus, and Arawacus form a monophyletic lineage, and their characterization leads to the following nomenclatural changes: Arawacus Kaye, 1904 = Polyniphes Kaye, 1904; Thereus HÃ¼bner, 1819 = Noreena Johnson, MacPherson, and Ingraham, 1986; and Rekoa Kaye, 1904 = Heterosmaitia Clench, 1964. Arawacus is accorded priority over Polyniphes, and Dolymorpha Holland, 1931 is a synonym of Arawacus, as others have proposed.Rekoa contains seven species and the following new synonyms: R. malina Hewitson, 1867 = R. phrynisca Burmeister, 1878; R. palegon Cramer, 1780 = R. cyrriana Hewitson, 1874 = R. ulia Dyar, 1913; R. zebina Hewitson, 1869 = R. orses Godman and Salvin, 1887 = R. guadala Schaus, 1902; R. bourkei Kaye, 1925 = R. abeja Johnson and Matusik, 1988; R. marius Lucas, 1857 = R. spurina Hewitson, 1867 = R. ericusa Hewitson, 1867 = R. brescia Hewitson, 1868 = R. voconia Hewitson, 1869; R. stagira Hewitson, 1867 = R. erenea Hewitson, 1867 = R. volana Hewitson, 1869 = R. lydia Kirby, 1871 = R. thoana Hewitson, 1874 = R. carioca Ebert, 1965. Lectotypes are designated for R. cyrriana, R. zebina, R. guadala, R. marius, R. spurina, R. ericusa, R. brescia, R. voconia, R. stagira, R. erenea, R. timaea Hewitson, 1869, R. volana, and R. thoana. No species was described in Rekoa, and R. meton (the type species of Rekoa) is the only one that had been transferred to it.I describe, illustrate, and code 47 characters of the head, wings, abdominal integument, and genitalia of Rekoa. Almost half of the characters are quantitative, and are coded with a modified form of gap coding. Because eumaeine morphology is so poorly known, the morphology section is hypertrophied, particularly by quantitative descriptions of antennae, androconia, and genitalia. There are two qualitatively distinct kinds of forewing androconial clusters in Rekoa: scent pads (restricted to the Eumaeini) with a chamber between the wing membranes and scent patches with the wing membranes fused except at the base of each androconium.Parsimony analysis of the character matrix yields a network of 78 steps with a consistency index of 0.885. Consistency among quantitative characters, with the exception of genital ones, is nearly as good as that for qualitative ones. The network is rooted using the outgroup parsimony criterion.The phylogeny serves as a framework for discussing Rekoa biogeography and evolution. Most Rekoa species are habitat generalists, but specialization for drier habitats evolved once as did restriction to lower elevations and specialization for higher elevations. Rekoa species are relatively dispersive and widespread, with four species occurring from northern Mexico to southern Brazil. Larvae are polyphagous on plant reproductive parts, but the majority of foodplant records for three Rekoa species are Leguminosae and Malpighiaceae whereas they are Compositae for R. palegon. There are two distinct ventral wing pattern phenotypes and two different genitalic phenotypes, but the change in wing pattern evolved at a different point than the change in genitalic phenotype. An effective "false head" wing pattern evolved once.

N2  - Lysianassoid Amphipoda found in the biotic communities surrounding deep-sea thermal vents are described. Most of the material comes from communities dominated by vestimentiferans, clams, and crabs near vents on the Galapagos Rift (0Â°) and similar vents at 13Â°N and 21Â°N in the eastern Pacific Ocean. These samples are supplemented by others collected from seamounts and trenches throughout the Pacific Ocean.Species occur in the well-known genera Euonyx, Hirondellea, Abyssorchomene, and Paralicella and in the newly described genera Apotectonia, Diatectonia, Tectovalopsis, Transtectonia, and Ventiella. Genera with the "tecto" root in their name belong to a group with affinities to Valettiopsis, a genus heretofore considered to be bathypelagic.The dominant amphipod is Ventiella sulfuris, new species, which comprises more than 98 percent of the 100,000 specimens examined. This genus is a derivative of the widespread deep-sea Schisturella.Important new observations on taxonomy in the Lysianassoidea are offered just at the time the family of 150+ genera is being revised and divided into several families and superfamilies. The principal problem characters involve toothed incisors and armament patterns of maxillae.

N2  - A new species, genus, and family are described from marine sediment collected east of Fort Pierce, Florida, USA, at a depth of 140 meters. Cateria submersa Gerlach, 1969, is placed in the new genus as Zelinkaderes submersus and is redescribed. Included is a review of classification of the phylum and a key to the orders, suborders, families, and genera of Zelinkaderidae, based upon adult characters. The complex head structure of Zelinkaderes floridensis, new species, is described and a new scheme of nomenclature is proposed for the arrangement of scalids. Collections of the new species were taken bimonthly for 12 months. Length/frequency study of the adults indicated only minor variation in size and abundance during the 12-month collecting period. All stages of the life history are included in the description of the new species. Molting of an adult is recorded for the first time. The new taxon may represent the most primitive kinorhynch so far discovered.

N2  - This paper is the second in a planned series designed to cover the ground-beetles of Central America both taxonomically and biogeographically. The area, for purposes of this series, extends from the northern border of Guatemala south to the border between the Republic of Panama and Colombia, including the near shore islands of both oceans. Species that are known to occur now in either Mexico or Colombia in the vicinity of the borders shared with Central American countries, and that may someday be found in Central America, are discussed as well. Included here is part of the subfamily Carabinae, tribes Notiophilini, Loricerini, and Carabini. Other tribes of Carabinae will be covered in another fascicle. Also included herein is a key to the presently described genera of the New World tropics, a classification scheme of the world fauna, and introductory material pertinent to both the series and the present contribution. The following genera are discussed: Notiophilus, Loricera, and Calosoma. All species, none of which are new, are redescribed and some structural parts of each are illustrated. Notes are provided on natural history and distribution for each species; dot maps illustrate the known Central American range of each taxon; and line or shaded drawings depict diagnostic characters.Este fascÃ­culo es el segundo de una serie planeada con el fin de cubrir los carÃ¡bidos de AmÃ©rica Central, tanto taxonÃ³mica como bio-geograficamente. El Ã¡rea en relaciÃ³n a esta serie se extiende desde la frontera norte de Guatemala hacia el sur en el area limÃ­trofe entre PanamÃ¡ y Colombia, incluyendo las islas cercanas a las costas de ambos oceanos. TambiÃ©n son consideradas las especies que han sido encontradas en MÃ©jico o Colombia, muy cerca a las fronteras compartidas con los paÃ­ses de AmÃ©rica Central y que alguna vez podrÃ­an ser halladas en esta zona. Se incluye en la Parte Ila sub-familia Carabinae, las tribus Notiophilini, Loricerini, y Carabini. Otras tribus de la misma sub-familia serÃ¡n tratadas en la Parte II. TambiÃ©n se incluye en la Parte II una clave para la genera del Nuevo Mundo hasta ahora descrita, un esquema de clasificaciÃ³n de la fauna mundial y material y mÃ©todos pertinentes a ambas series. En la Parte I, la siguiente genera es tratada: Notiophilus, Loricera, y Calosoma. Todas las especies aunque descritas anteriormente, son redescritas y algunas partes estructurales ilustradas. Se dan a conocer notas sobre historia natural y distribuciÃ³n para cada taxon; mapas de localizamiento ilustran el alcance de distribuciÃ³n de cada especie en AmÃ©rica Central y diferentes dibujos representan caracterÃ­sticas especÃ­ficas a cada una.

N2  - Eleven species are now recognized in the genus Stegoelmis. Two of the three previously described species, S. geayi (Grouvelle) and S. verrucata Hinton, are redescribed and illustrated; the third previously described species, S. hintoni Sanderson, is found to be conspecific with S. geayi and is placed in synonymy. Nine new speciesâ€”S. andersoni, S. crinita, S. ennsi, S. fera, S. ica, S. selva, S. sticta, S. stictoides, S. tuberosa,â€”and associated larvae of S. geayi and S. selva are described and illustrated by line drawings and scanning electron micrographs. The presence of spiracular gills on the larvae in place of typical spiracles is described; this is the first instance of this unusual system of respiration reported for the suborder Polyphaga and the family Elmidae. Maps showing known distribution of each species are included and typical biotopes are described and illustrated. Keys in English and Spanish to the elmid subfamilies and the species of Stegoelmis are included.Actualmente se reconocen once especies en el gÃ¨nero Stegoelmis.

N2  - Seventy four species of decapods and two species of stomatopods are recorded from Ascension Island. Of the decapods, 22 (30%) are amphi-Atlantic, 14 (19%) are endemic to the island, 19 (26%) occur in the central and western Atlantic only, and 14 (19%) are known only from the central and eastern Atlantic. Two new genera are recognized, Laleonectes, type species Portunus vocans A. Milne Edwards, and Tetrasquilla, type species Lysiosquilla mccullochae Schmitt. Ten new species are described: Typton ascensionis, Gnathophyllum ascensione, Salmoneus setosus, Salmoneus teres, Processa packeri, Microprosthema inornatum, Odontozona anaphorae, Clibanarius rosewateri, Mursia mcdowelli, and Cataleptodius olsoni. Seven of the nine known shallow-water pantropical species of decapods and the only pantropical stomatopod are found at Ascension. Dardanus imperator, Euryozius sanguineus, Gecarcinus lagostoma, and Pachygrapsus loveridgei, are central Atlantic island species, known almost exclusively from Ascension or from Ascension and St. Helena. The percent of amphi-Atlantic fauna is about the same on Ascension (30%) and St. Helena (29%), but the percent of eastern Atlantic fauna (26% vs. 19%) and Indo-West Pacific fauna (23% vs. 16%) are higher at St. Helena; the component of western Atlantic fauna (26% vs. 14%) and endemic species (19% vs. 9%) are higher at Ascension.

N2  - The ahermatypic Scleractinia of the GalÃ¡pagos and Cocos islands are revised based primarily on the collections of the 1986 expedition of the Johnson-Sea-Link I research submersible. A historical review of the previous work on ahermatypic Scleractinia from the GalÃ¡pagos and Cocos islands is given. Forty-two ahermatypic species from the GalÃ¡pagos and 12 ahermatypic species from Cocos Island, including nine and five new records, respectively, are described and illustratedâ€”because of overlap in distribution, a total of 44 species. One genus, Pseudocyathoceras, and nine species are described as new: Cladocora pacifica, Oculina profunda, Caryophyllia perculta, C. solida, Concentrotheca vaughani, Crispatotrochus galapagensis, Anomocora carinata, Polymyces wellsi, and Dendrophyllia johnsoni. Crispatotrochus Tenison Woods, 1878, is resurrected and designated the senior synonym of Cyathoceras Moseley, 1881. In order to facilitate comparisons within the subgenus Caryophyllia (Caryophyllia), the 56 Recent species and subspecies are tabulated based on the nature of their base, septal symmetry, number of septa, and their distribution. The four species of Galapagan Tubastraea are also compared in a tabular key.The zoogeographic affinities of both the Galapagan and Cocos Island ahermatypic Scleractinia are found to be consistent with other groups of marine invertebrates. The Galapagan fauna has a 41% endemic component, 21% Panamanian, 19% Indo-Pacific, 14% cosmopolitan, and 5% West Indian. The West Indian affinity is strengthened by the suggestion of two geminate species pairs: Cladocora pacifica-C. debilis and Oculina profunda-O. varicosa. The Cocos ahermatypic fauna has smaller endemic and larger Panamanian components, 17% and 33% respectively, the remaining species equally allied between the Indo-Pacific region and cosmopolitan species.

N2  - Samples collected at Bikini Atoll in 1946 and at Enewetak Atoll in 1969 and 1979, mainly in benthic traps and bottom trawl samples, contained a diverse assortment of mydocopid ostracodes: 17 species (3 described previously, 12 new, and 2 left in open nomenclature) in 15 genera (2 new). Keys are supplied for genera in the Sarsiellinae and to species in 3 genera. Three species from Enewetak Atoll were previously known from either Hawaii, Fiji, or the Philippine Islands. Of the 15 genera collected at Enewetak and Bikini atolls, 7 are world-wide, 6 are known primarily from the Indo-West Pacific Region, and 2 are known only from the atolls. The juveniles as well as the adults are described for the new species Cypridina spina and C. spinula, and it is determined that each has 6 stages including the adult.A table is presented listing the number of pectinate teeth comprising the main tooth of the 5th limb of species of Cypridinidae for which this character is known; the number of teeth on the adult 5th limb ranges from 3 to 7, and about 90% of the species have 6. For those species having 6 pectinate teeth on the adult 1 tooth is added on each succeeding instar starting with instar I, information useful for identifying the age of instars.

Sepedonea vau Mello and Bredt is placed as a nomen nudum under S. guianica. A key to the adults is included, and the male and female terminalia of all species are described and illustrated. The eggs, first-, second-, and third-instar larvae, and puparia of S. guianica, S. incipiens, S. lagoa, S. lindneri, S. telson, and S. trichotypa are described and figured for the first time. These species, plus S. guatemalana and S. isthmi, are included in keys to the mature third-instar larvae and puparia. The taxonomy, biology, and geographic distribution of the genus is summarized. The taxonomic placement of the Sepedon group is discussed. The geographical distributions of 11 species are mapped.The larvae of all reared species of Sepedonea are predators of non-operculate snails in various freshwater situations.

T1  - Systematics of the Neotropical Characiform Genus Steindachnerina Fowler (Pisces: Ostariophysi)

N2  - The genus Steindachnerina Fowler (1906) of the characiform family Curimatidae is defined as a monophyletic unit. Shared derived features of the gill arches and possibly in dorsal-fin pigmentation diagnose the genus. Derived features of the gill arches, buccopharyngeal complex, infraorbital series, palatine arch, and neurocranium, form of the prepelvic region of the body, details of pigmentation, and meristic features define monophyletic subunits of Steindachnerina or are autapomorphic for species.Steindachnerina has three junior synonyms Curimatorbis, Cruxentina, and Rivasella, all described by FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948). Twenty-one species are recognized in Steindachnerina: S. amazonica (Steindachner, 1911) of the Rio Tocantins; S. argentea (Gill, 1858) of Trinidad, the RÃ­o Orinoco, and coastal rivers of northern Venezuela; S. atratoensis (Eigenmann, 1912b) of the RÃ­o Atrato; S. bimaculata (Steindachner, 1876) of the Rio Amazonas and RÃ­o Orinoco; S. binotata (Pearson, 1924) of the Rio Madeira; S. biornata (Braga and Azpelicueta, 1987) of the RÃ­o de La Plata basin and the coastal rivers of Uruguay and southern Brazil; S. brevipinna (Eigenmann and Eigenmann, 1889) of the RÃ­o Uruguay, RÃ­o Paraguay, and lower RÃ­o ParanÃ¡, and possibly the upper Rio Xingu; S. conspersa (Holmberg, 1891) of the RÃ­o Paraguay and lower RÃ­o ParanÃ¡; S. dobula (GÃ¼nther, 1868a) of the western Amazon basin; S. elegans (Steindachner, 1874) of the coastal rivers of eastern Brazil; S. fasciata (Vari and GÃ©ry, 1985) of the Rio Madeira basin; S. gracilis Vari and Vari (1989) of the Rio Tocantins; S. guentheri (Eigenmann and Eigenmann, 1889) distributed from Guyana through the RÃ­o Orinoco basin, and the Andean peidmont to northern Bolivia; S. hypostoma (Boulenger, 1887a) of the Amazon basin; S. insculpta (FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez, 1948) of the upper RÃ­o ParanÃ¡; S. leucisca (GÃ¼nther, 1868) of the Amazon basin; S. notonota (Miranda-Ribeiro, 1937) of northeastern Brazil; S. planiventris Vari and Vari (1989) of the Amazon basin; S. pupula, new species, endemic to the RÃ­o Orinoco; S. quasimodoi Vari and Vari (1989) from the RÃ­o Yavari (Rio JavarÃ­); and S. runa, new species, from Surinam, French Guiana, and Brazil. A key to the species of Steindachnerina is provided.Nineteen species and subspecies are placed into synonymy in this study. Curimatus leuciscus bolivae described by Eigenmann and Ogle (1908) and Allenina pectinata FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948) are placed into the synonymy of Steindachnerina leucisca. Curimatus trachystetus Cope (1878), C. bimaculatus sialis Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889), Prochilodus pterostigma Fowler (1913), Curimatus semiornatus Steindachner (1914), and Curimata melaniris Fowler (1940) are all placed into the synonymy of Steindachnerina bimaculata. Curimata stigmosa Vari (1987) is a synonym of Curimata biornata. Curimatus nitens Holmberg (1891) and Curimatus nigrotaenia Boulenger (1902) are placed into the synonymy of Steindachnerina brevipinna. Curimatus nasus Steindachner (1882), Curimata hypostoma hastata Allen (in Eigenmann and Allen, 1942), Curimata niceforoi Fowler (1943a), and Prochilodus stigmaturus (Fowler, 1911), are all considered synonyms of Steindachnerina dobula. Steindachnerina guentheri has four junior synonyms: Curimatus morawhannae Eigenmann (1912a), Curimatus issororoensis Eigenmann (1912a), Curimatus metae Eigenmann (1922), and Curimata robustula Allen (in Eigenmann and Allen, 1942). Curimatus elegans bahiensis Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) is placed into the synonymy of Steindachnerina elegans.The phylogenetic biogeography of Steindachnerina indicates numerous cases of large-scale, secondary dispersal during the evolution of the genus. The basal speciation events within Steindachnerina predate the final uplift of the Andes. A major part of the speciation within the genus predates the formation of the Amazon basin and apparently occurred outside of the Rio Amazonas system or in peripheral portions of the basin. The previous occurrence of a Steindachnerina species within the RÃ­o Magdalena system of Colombia and its subsequent extinction is hypothesized based on phylogenetic and distributional data.

N2  - An attempt was made to obtain fossil vertebrates from the island of San Salvador, Bahamas, to compare its past fauna with that known from the islands of the Great Bahama Bank, from which San Salvador has always been isolated. Although previous agricultural practices and guano mining have rendered the caves of San Salvador a poor source of fossils, some Quaternary vertebrate remains were recovered, including the following new to the island: two turtles (Emydidae and Testudinidae, genera indeterminate), a crocodile (cf. Crocodylus sp.), Audubon's Shearwater (Puffinus lherminieri), Black-crowned Night Heron (Nycticorax nycticorax) and Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura). Remains from recent Barn Owl (Tyto alba) pellets were also analyzed and included the Blue Grosbeak (Passerina caerulea), also apparently new to the island. Notes on the status of the extant fauna treat, among others, the following endemic or near-endemic taxa: the lizards Cyclura rileyi and Leiocephalus loxogrammus, the woodpecker Melanerpes superciliosus nyeanus, and the bat Natalus tumidifrons.

These species live in small-sized, perennial epigean and hypogean groundwater habitats (e.g., primarily springs and cave streams). Fontigens and the European Emmericia Brusina, 1870, are grouped in the probably monophyletic subfamily Emmericiinae Brusina. The distinguishing features of Fontigens are from protoconch sculpture, radula, penis, and pallial oviduct complex. Nine modern species (comprising three groups) are recognized: F. aldrichi (Call and Beecher); F. antroecetes (Hubricht); F. bottimeri (Walker), new combination; F. morrisoni, new species (from Upper James River basin of Virginia); F. nickliniana (Lea); F. orolibas Hubricht; F. proserpina (Hubricht); F. tartarea Hubricht; and F. turritella Hubricht. Four species occur exclusively in subterranean habitats, whereas four others are found in small surface springs and cave streams, and one is primarily found in surface waters. Fontigens holsingeri Hubricht is placed in synonomy with F. tartarea Hubricht, while F. cryptica Hubricht is considered a distinctive form of uncertain status that is possibly extinct. Cincinnatia binneyana Hannibal is probably not referable to Fontigens (contrary to previous opinion).

T1  - Monograph of the Genus Cerithium BruguiÃ¨re in the Indo-Pacific (Cerithiidae: Prosobrachia)

N2  - The genus Cerithium BruguiÃ¨re, 1789, comprises a large group of morphologically highly variable species characterized by many-whorled, elongate shells having ovate apertures, slightly reflected anterior canals and sculpture, consisting of axial ribs, spiral cords with beads and nodes, and randomly placed varices. The mantle edge is bilobed in cross-section, and has small papillae arising from the inner lobe. The osphradium is bipectinate and the hypobranchial gland well developed. The radula is taenioglosate, paired salivary glands pass through the nerve ring, an esophageal gland is present, and the large stomach has a style sac, crystalline style, and gastric shield. The nervous system is epiathroid. Pallial gonoducts are open; the pallial oviduct includes a large spermatophore bursa and two seminal receptacles. Males are aphallate and produce dimorphic sperm, which are transferred by spermatophores. Females have a ciliated egg-laying groove on the right side of the foot and the egg mass consists of interwined, gelatinous strings.The genus dates from the late Cretaceous, and was species-rich during the Cenozoic: many living species are also known in the Cenozoic fossil record. Cerithium species span a broad variety of habitats, but the great majority live intertidally or in shallow water, and are microphagous herbivores. Most species have a planktotrophic larval stage and wide geographic distributions.The Indo-Pacific Marine Province supports 68 percent of all Cerithium species. Forty-two living species, including five new taxa, are recognized: C. abditum, new species; C. africanum, new species; C. alexandri Tomlin; C. amirantium E.A. Smith; C. atromarginatum Dautzenberg and Bouge; C. balteatum Philippi; C. caeruleum Sowerby; C. citrinum Sowerby; C. claviforme Schepman; C. columna Sowerby; C. coralium Kiener; C. crassilabrum Krauss; C. dialeucum Philippi; C. echinatum Sowerby; C. egenum Gould; C. flemischi K. Martin; C. gloriosum, new species; C. interstriatum Sowerby; C. koperbergi Schepman; C. leptocharactum Rehder; C. lifuense Melvill and Standen; C. lissum Watson; C. madreporicolum Jousseaume; C. matukense Watson; C. munitum Sowerby; C. nesioticum Pilsbry and Vanatta; C. nodulosum BruguiÃ¨re; C. novaehollandiae A. Adams; C. ophioderma (Habe), new combination; C. pacificum, new species; C. phoxum Watson; C. punctatum BruguiÃ¨re; C. rehderi, new species; C. rostratum Sowerby; C. ruppelli Philippi; C. salebrosum Sowerby; C. scabridum Philippi; C. scobiniforme, new species; C. tenellum Sowerby; C. torresi E.A. Smith; C. traillii Sowerby; C. zonatum (Wood).Four different types of radular morphology were determined among the above species. The anatomy of twelve species was studied and among these three different types of pallial oviduct arrangements were discerned, suggesting that Cerithium may comprise several clades or groups. Monophyly has not been established; thus, formal taxonomic recognition of these morphological groups is withheld until the anatomy of more Cerithium species is known.

T1  - Demography and Natural History of the Common Fruit Bat, Artibeus jamaicensis, on Barro Colorado Island, PanamÃ¡

N2  - Bats were marked and monitored on Barro Colorado Island, PanamÃ¡, to study seasonal and annual variation in distribution, abundance, and natural history from 1975 through 1980. Data gathered advances our knowledge about flocking; abundance; feeding strategies; social behavior; species richness; population structure and stability; age and sex ratios; life expectancy and longevity; nightly, seasonal, and annual movements; synchrony within and between species in reproductive activity; timing of reproductive cycles; survival and dispersal of recruits; intra-and inter-specific relationships; and day and night roost selection.Barro Colorado Island (BCI) harbors large populations of bats that feed on the fruit of canopy trees, especially figs. These trees are abundant, and the individual asynchrony of their fruiting rhythms results in a fairly uniform abundance of fruit. When figs are scarce, a variety of other fruits is available to replace them. This relatively dependable food supply attracts a remarkably rich guild of bats.Although we marked all bats caught, we tried to maximize the number of Artibeus jamaicensis netted, because it is abundant (2/3 of the total catch of bats on BCI), easily captured by conventional means (mist nets set at ground level), and responds well to handling and marking.An average Artibeus jamaicensis is a 45 g frugivore that eats roughly its weight in fruit every night. These bats prefer figs and often seek them out even when other types of fruit they might eat are far more abundant. They commute several hundred meters to feeding trees on the average, feeding on fruit from one to four trees each night, and returning to a single fruiting tree an average of four nights in succession. The bats tend to fly farther when fewer fig trees are bearing ripe fruit, and they feed from fewer trees, on the average, when the moon is nearly full. These bats, like their congeners, do not feed in the fruiting tree itself. Instead, they select a fruit and carry it to a feeding roost typically about 100 m away before eating it. We utilized radio telemetry to assess feeding rates from the number of "feeding passes"â€”transits between fruit tree and feeding roost. Bats are often netted while carrying fruit, revealing their diet. Feces also reveal dietary information.Adult female A. jamaicensis live in harems of three to 30 individuals with a single adult male. On BCI the harem groups roost during the day in hollow trees. There is presumably a large population of surplus males that roost together with nonadults of both sexes in foliage. Females commute an average of 600 m from their day roosts to feeding sites, and harem males travel less than 300 m. Twice a year most females give birth to a single young, once in March or April, and again in July or August; active gestation averages about 19 weeks. Juveniles are first netted when they are about ten weeks old, and females usually first bear young in March or April following their year of birth.

N2  - One hundred of the 155 known Japanese species of Pycnogonida (plus 4 unnamed species) were collected for this report and these are described and their distribution listed. These include 20 new species fully described and figured with five additional figures given for rare species, for sexual features of previously unknown males of known species, and for two unnamed species. The 20 new species described are Ascorhynchus simplex, Chonothea verrucosa, Cilunculus galeritus, C. gracilis, Heterofragilia hirsuta, Anoplodactylus lineatus, A. tanseii, A. velamellus, Callipallene bullata, Nymphon aritai, N. brevis, N. citerium, N. forceps, N. improcerum, N. infundibulum, N. longispinum, N. maruyamai, N. okudai, N. pumillum, and N. simulatum. The zoogeography of the 100 described species is summarized and it is concluded that one out of every six known pycnogonid species in the world is found in Japanese territorial waters within the 200 mile economic zone, making it the richest known fauna of any area of equal size in the world.The "Bibliography" includes most literature on the pycnogonids known to the authors and published in the decade since Fry and Stock produced the first comprehensive bibliography in 1978, except for a few problematical papers and a few "fossil" chapters in books, which provide nothing new to pycnogonid science.

N2  - A taxonomic and cross-referenced alphabetic catalog is presented of all stony coral type specimens deposited in the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) as of 1990. The following categories of types are included: holotype, paratype, lectotype, paralectotype, neotype, and syntype. The type specimens of 1107 nominal taxa are cataloged, including 156 calcified hydrozoans (Milleporidae, Stylasteridae) and 951 taxa of Scleractinia. Five data categories are included for each taxon in the alphabetic list: kind of type; catalog number; locality reference; number and nature of specimens; and geologic age. Optional remarks include references to senior synonyms, new generic combinations, authorships of neo- and lectotype designations, and other pertinent nomenclatural data. Special problems concerning the interpretation of the type status of species described by J.D. Dana and T.W. Vaughan are discussed; a table is presented listing new species subsequently derived from Dana's (1846) monograph. A separate bibliography is given of the 185 publications wherein stony coral types are designated that are deposited at the NMNH. Visitation to the NMNH for the purpose of examining the coral collection, and loans, gifts, and exchanges of scientifically valuable corals are encouraged. One taxonomic action is contained herein; Flabellum floridanum is proposed for Flabellum fragile Cairns, a junior primary homonym of Flabellum cuneiforme var. fragile Vaughan.

N2  - Behavioral, ecological, and distributional data are provided for 40 species of Sri Lankan wasps in the families Eumenidae, Vespidae, Pompilidae, and Crabronidae. All species are solitary except the subsocial vespid, Eustenogaster eximia (Bingham), which rarely exhibits primitive eusociality.Behavioral data on Eumenidae, Pompilidae, and Crabronidae may include the following aspects: nest construction and architecture; prey hunting or capture; prey transport to nest; natural enemies; and adult behavior.An extended section on E. eximia provides detailed information on the following: nest architecture, materials used, the bonding role of hyphae of a species of Polyporaceae or Telephoraceae (Basidiomycetes, Aphyllophorales) in carton composition, and construction; brood development with analyses of larval food (Araneae and Hymenoptera); nature of the cocoon, initially fine silken threads overlain by a glistening film; nest associates including natural enemies (Hymenoptera) and associated or commensal organisms (Isoptera, Collembola, Diptera, Lepidoptera, Acaridei, and Fusarium species (Hyphomycetes)); and adult behavior and limited eusociality.The range of each species is given as well as detailed locality records of its occurrence, insofar as possible, in Sri Lanka. Additional data include the ecological zone(s) in which each species is found in Sri Lanka, and the ranges in altitude and average annual rainfall. The text is supplemented by a map delineating the ecological zones and average annual rainfall, as well as photographs of the nests of a few species, and scanning electron micrographs of cell wall composition and cocoon fabric in E. eximia.

N2  - Two new species of Ostracoda in the suborder Myodocopina are described and illustrated from hydrothermal vents in the eastern Pacific Ocean at depths of 1570-2600 m. One species, Euphilomedes climax, is from vents along the Explorer and Juan de Fuca Ridges, and another, Prionotoleberis styx, is from vents along the East Pacific Rise. Both species are from depths not previously reported for members of the genera. During ontogeny E. climax passes through 5 juvenile instars, the same number previously reported for a shallow water species of the genus, and changes in appendages during ontogeny are similar for both species. A key is presented to blind species of Prionotoleberis. A compilation from the literature shows differences in the number of bristles on the 9th exopodial joint of the 2nd antennae between species of the Pseudophilomedinae and the Philomedinae, and a key based on the number of bristles is presented for identifying instars of five genera of the Philomedinae (Anarthron, Euphilomedes, Paraphilomedes, Philomedes, Scleroconcha). Interesting differences between the Philomedinae and Pseudophilomedinae are noted: (1) known members of Philomedinae have 4-7 bristles on the 9th exopodial joint of the 2nd antenna compared to 2 or 3 bristles for known Pseudophilomedinae; (2) except for Zeugophilomedes, known female Philomedinae have more bristles on the 9th joint than the male whereas known female Pseudophilomedinae have either the same number or fewer bristles than the male; (3) known Philomedinae have 6 stages whereas known Pseudophilomedinae have 5. Also collected at the vents were four species of the halocyprid genus Bathyconchoecia from the Guaymas Basin, and many specimens of Conchoecinae from the East Pacific Rise and Guaymas Basin.

N2  - Using 81 transformation series containing 172 characters of osteology, dentition, and external morphology, the phylogeny of Recent erinaceids is investigated using standard phylogenetic techniques. For this analysis, we used as the first taxonomic outgroup of Erinaceidae, Soricoidea + Tenrecoidea; and as the second taxonomic outgroup, â€ Leptictidae. Supraspecific monophyletic groups identified from this analysis are Erinaceidae; Hylomyinae; Podogymnura (aureospinula, truei); Echinosorex + Podogymnura; Hylomys (sinensis, suillus, hainanensis); Erinaceinae; Hemiechinus; subgenus Paraechinus ((aethiopicus, micropus), hypomelas) +  H. auritus + H. collaris; Mesechinus dauuricus  + (Erinaceus + Atelerix); Erinaceus (europaeus, concolor, amurensis); and Atelerix ((albiventris, sclateri), algirus, frontalis). Evidence does not support the monophyly of Hemiechinus (as recognized by Honacki et al., 1982) or of Hemiechinus excluding H. dauuricus. Mesechinus is elevated from subgeneric status (under Hemiechinus) to generic status to contain dauuricus and hughi. Paraechinus is considered a subgenus of Hemiechinus. Neohylomys and Neotetracus are considered synonyms of Hylomys. Diagnoses and taxonomic accounts of genera are presented along with comments on the taxonomy of and variation within species. Hemiechinus aethiopicus, H. deserti, and H. dorsalis are provisionally regarded as subspecies of H. aethiopicus.

N2  - We report on the putative primary (name-bearing) and secondary types of 189 species and subspecies, represented by 557 type lots and approximately 3600 specimens. We attempted to verify the type status of each lot, and report errors and discrepancies between information derived from putative type specimens and information in original descriptions and USNM catalog ledgers. We located some types that had been reported as missing. The resolution of two problems necessitated our designating lectotypes for Isesthes ionthas and Isesthes scrutator, both Jordan and Gilbert, 1882.Among the USNM primary type lots are some that were published as being deposited in the collections of the Natural History Museum (BMNH), Stanford University (now at California Academy of Sciences), New York Zoological Society, and the private collection of C.L.P. Bonaparte, which was once deposited at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. Many type problems we discuss emanated from the actions of D. S. Jordan and colleagues while at Stanford University (SU) during the early 1900s. Our findings regarding these problems may be useful in resolving similar problems involving other SU and USNM specimens.

N2  - The Department of Antioquia, with its capital MedellÃ­n, is situated in the northwestern quadrant of Colombia, South America. In elevation it runs from sea level to 3,900 meters and, in general, has abundant rainfall. Most of the material comes from the montane areas near MedellÃ­n, including year long emergence trap collections made at 3 sites by U. Matthias. These emergence trap collections show a definite correlation between emergence and rainfall pattern. The fauna, although nearly 46% is still known only from this one region, seems to show a distribution pattern that extends along the Andes to Ecuador and/or Venezuela, at a minimum. The 37 genera recorded belong to 13 families, and contain 124 named species, plus another 23 species whose material was not adequate for description. Of the 124 named species, 69 are described as new in this work. All the species are keyed, discussed, and illustrated.

N2  - Thirty-five species taken by the Galathea expedition are reported, most from shallow water stations. The seventeen species of Stomatopoda known with certainty to live in depths greater than 400 meters are listed. Acaenosquilla, new genus, is recognized for two species previously placed in Heterosquilloides, A. brazieri (Miers, 1880) and A. latifrons (De Haan, 1844). The collection includes a late larva of Bathysquilla crassispinosa (Fukuda, 1909), the first known larva of a bathysquillid. Five species are synonymized: Clorida javanica Moosa, 1974, with C. latreillei (Eydoux and Souleyet, 1842), Clorida merguiensis (Tiwari and Biswas, 1952) with C. verrucosa (Hansen, 1926), Gonodactylus childi Manning, 1971, with G. incipiens Lanchester, 1903, Heterosquilla (Heterosquilloides) zarenkovi Makarov, 1978, with Heterosquilloides insignis (Kemp, 1911), and both Squilloides latus spinosus Blumstein, 1970, and Squilloides espinosus Blumstein, 1974, with Lenisquilla lata (Brooks, 1886).

Other subgenera of Allotrichoma are diagnosed and keyed, and genera related to Allotrichoma are keyed and placed in Hecamedini, new tribe, which is diagnosed. Nine species are now known in Pseudohecamede, five of which are new (in alphabetical order): A. adustum (Belize, Stann Creek District, Twin Cays), A. baja (Mexico, Baja California, Todos Santos), A. ecuadorensis (Ecuador, Manabi Province, Bahia), A. jamaicense (Jamaica, Wag Water), and A. steineri (Costa Rica, Guanacaste Province, Playa Tamarindo). Species of Pseudohecamede occur only in the New World, particularly in subtropical and tropical zones, where they apparently occupy microhabitats similar to those of the nearctic Allotrichoma, sensu stricto. Descriptions of species are accompanied by distributional maps and illustrations of male terminalia. For some species, diagnostic characters of the head and thorax are also provided. A key to the species is included.

N2  - The genus Eunice has been widely reported in all kinds of marine environment. A total of 286 names have been applied to taxa originally described in, or subsequently referred to, the genus. All such taxa published prior to 1985 have been accounted for below. Of these, some or all types of about 175 are available and are described below. Twenty-five species are incompletely known; types are missing and original descriptions (or subsequent descriptions of types) are insufficient to relate these species to the rest. The descriptions of these species have been briefly summarized. A key to species includes nearly all species for which types were available. Species considered incompletely known are excluded from the key, but are included when possible in a set of tables comparing similar species. Forty-seven named taxa are indeterminable. Twenty-two have been referred to other genera, including some new combinations. In some cases the type lot included two species; some of these types could be referred to other, known species; however, four species are described as new. Seven species have been given new names for nomenclatural reasons.Attempts to group the 206 reasonably well-characterized species into supra-specific taxa using cladistic techniques did not lead to interpretable results. The reasons might include the very large number of species compared to the number of characters. A detailed analysis of the characters has been started using freshly collected material in an attempt to expand the number of characters and measure the variability of currently used characters. Similar reviews are planned for the remaining eunicean genera.

N2  - Greya is a genus of particular biological interest, in that it is among the genera closest related to the yucca moths, which are widely quoted in discussions of coevolution. Both Greya and the new genus Tetragma share some morphological and behavioral traits with the yucca moths. In this paper, the general morphology, classification, distribution, and biology of the western North American genera Greya and Tetragma new genus, are reviewed, and a phylogeny is proposed. Sixteen species of Greya are recognized, including seven new species: G. mitellae, G. obscura, G. enchrysa, G. variabilis, G. pectinifera, G. suffusca, and G. powelli. Greya piperella is resurrected as a valid species. The new genus Tetragma is described, with the single, new species T. gei. Keys are provided for all species, and diagnostic characters of all taxa are illustrated by line drawings and photographs.

N2  - The aquatic beetle family Elmidae consists of two subfamilies, the Elminae and the Larainae. There are nine genera presently assigned to the subfamily Larainae in the Western Hemisphere; five of the laraine genera, Disersus Sharp (1882), Hexanchorus Sharp (1882), Hispaniolara Brown (1981a), Phanocerus Sharp (1882), and Pseudodisersus Brown (1981a), are known to occur in the area of this studyâ€”Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies. A new genus Pharceonus based on a previously undescribed species is described and brings the number of laraine genera from the area of study to six. Keys are provided for the following: adults of the 2 subfamilies, Elminae and Larainae; adults of the 6 laraine genera known from Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies; 13 species included in those genera; and the 5 known larvae of the subfamily from the area of study (larvae of Disersus, Hexanchorus, Hispaniolara, Phanocerus, and Pseudodisersus). All included taxa are described or redescribed; synonymies are cited; and maps showing known distribution are included for each species. Pertinent character states for recognition of the various taxa are discussed, illustrated by photographs, line drawings, or scanning electron micrographs. Habitats of adults and larvae are discussed and illustrated with photographs.The following taxa presently are known to occur in the study area: Disersus longipennis Sharp (1882) and Disersus uncus Spangler and Santiago (1982); Hexanchorus caraibus (Coquerel, 1851), Hexanchorus gracilipes Sharp (1882), Hexanchorus crinitus, new species, Hexanchorus browni, new species, Hexanchorus usitatus, new species, and Hexanchorus emarginatus, new species; Hispaniolara farri Brown (1981a); Phanocerus clavicornis Sharp (1882), Phanocerus congener Grouvelle (1898); Pharceonus volcanus, new genus, new species; and Pseudodisersus goudotii (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville, 1843). Two species, Phanocerus helmoides Darlington (1936) and Phanocerus hubbardi Schaeffer (1911), are synonymized with Phanocerus clavicornis Sharp and the subspecies Hexanchorus gracilipes orientalis Zaragoza (1982) is synonymized with Hexanchorus gracilipes.

N2  - Twenty-eight species (25 new) in twenty genera in five families of myodocopid Ostracoda are described and illustrated from collections made mostly at shelf and upper bathyal depths in the northeastern end of the Mozambique Channel, primarily from the vicinity of Mayotte (Commoro Islands) and the Glorioso Islands, Geyser, Leven, and Zelee banks (Madagascar). All specimens were collected by French personnel during the BenthÃ©di Expedition of 1977, under the auspices of three French institutions: Station Marine d'Endoume, University d'Aix-Marseille; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique; Centre National pour l'Exploitation des OcÃ©ans. The ontogeny is described for three new species of Codonocera, Rutiderma, and Synasterope, and a graph is presented showing the approximate relationship between the percentage of myodocopid species worldwide having lateral eyes and the depth of water in which they live. A possible relationship between morphology, locomotion, and mating habitat is discussed for the genus Harbansus.

N2  - The family Pholoidae is reviewed and revised, based on reexamination of type material and published records, as well as on examination of new material. Two of the numerous species of Pholoe Johnston, 1839, are redescribed; four additional species of Pholoe and Genus A of Wolf, 1984a, are referred to three new genera; and two new interstitial species from New Zealand are described in one of the genera. Pholoides Pruvot, 1895 (including Peisidice Johnson, 1897, Pareupholoe Hartmann-SchrÃ¶der, 1962, and Parapholoe Hartmann-SchrÃ¶der, 1965), includes three species (and three synonyms). The aberrant neotenic Metaxypsamma uebelackerae Wolf, 1986, is removed from the family Sigalionidae and added to the Pholoidae, based on its close relationship to Pholoe. Unusual types of reproduction are described in the small interstitial species. They have relatively few large eggs developing in the body and within the elytra (viviparity) or with eggs and juveniles brooded under the elytra.

N2  - The genus Curimatella Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889) is hypothesized to be a monophyletic unit of the characiform family Curimatidae. Curimatella is defined by the apomorphic possession of a field of small scales extending over at least the basal two-thirds of the middle rays of each lobe of the caudal fin in adults.Curimatella is redefined and three genera (Apolinarella, Walbaunina, and Lepipinna) described by FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez (1948) are synonymized under Curimatella. Five species are recognized in Curimatella: C. alburna (MÃ¼ller and Troschel, 1844), distributed widely through the Rio Amazonas system and perhaps present in the upper Rupununi River basin; C. dorsalis (Eigenmann and Eigenmann, 1889b), a species distributed through the RÃ­o Orinoco, Rio Amazonas, and portions of the RÃ­o de La Plata basin; C. immaculata (FernÃ¡ndez-YÃ©pez, 1948), widespread through the RÃ­o Orinoco and Rio Amazonas; C. lepidura (Eigenmann and Eigenmann, 1889a) endemic to the Rio SÃ£o Francisco; and C. meyeri (Steindachner, 1882) of the central and western portions of the Rio Amazonas basin. A key to the species of Curimatella is provided.Seven nominal species or subspecies are placed into synonymy. Curimatella alburnus australe Eigenmann and Kennedy (1903) based on specimens from AsunciÃ³n, Paraguay, Curimatus elegans paraguayensis Eigenmann and Kennedy (1903) with a type locality in the RÃ­o Paraguay in Paraguay, Curimatus (Curimatella) alburnus var. caudimaculata Pellegrin (1909) described from specimens collected in the central Amazon, and Curimatus bolivarensis Steindachner (1910) with a type series originating in the lower RÃ­o Orinoco are placed into the synonymy of Curimatella dorsalis. Curimatella meyeri has two synonyms, Curimatus serpae Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889a) described from specimens collected at Serpa (= Itacoatiara) along the Rio Amazonas, and Curimata reticulata Allen in Eigenmann and Allen (1942) based on specimens collected in the RÃ­o Ucayali drainage of Peru. Curimatus alburnus lineatus Eigenmann and Eigenmann (1889b) based on a specimen from the western Amazon is a synonym of Curimatella alburna.Lectotypes are designated for Curimatus lepidurus Eigenmann and Eigenmann, Curimatus (Curimatella) alburnus var. caudimaculatus Pellegrin, Curimatus bolivarensis Steindachner, and Anodus alburnus MÃ¼ller and Troschel.A key is provided to the genera of the Curimatidae and a revised key is presented for the genus Curimatopsis Steindachner. Major range extensions are reported for Curimatopsis microlepis Eigenmann and Eigenmann and C. myersi Vari, and the presence of Curimata vittata Kner in the RÃ­o Orinoco basin is confirmed.

N2  - Over a 19 month period I observed the social behaviors of individually recognized green iguanas, Iguana iguana, at three sites in the llanos of Venezuela. The behavior of iguanas outside the mating season differed from that seen during the mating season in three major ways: (1) during normal waking hours outside the breeding season, adult iguanas spent the majority of time immobile, apparently resting; (2) their interactions involved fewer high intensity displays; and (3) their day to day movements were often nomadic.During the mating season, one site was watched continuously during daylight hours (iguanas sleep throughout the night), allowing a complete count of all copulation attempts (N = 250) and territorial interactions. At all sites, dominant males controlled access to small mating territories. Within the territories there did not appear to be any resources needed by females or their offspring. Thus, females could choose mates directly on the basis of male phenotype. Females aggregated in the mating territories of the largest males and mated preferentially with them. Territorial males copulated only once per day, although on several occasions more than one resident female was receptive on the same day. A few small nonterritorial males exhibited pseudofemale behavior (i.e., they abstained from sexual competition), but most nonterritorial males stayed on the periphery of mating territories and attempted to force copulations on unguarded females (peripheral male behavior). Uncooperative females were mounted by as many as three males simultaneously. Females resisted 95% of the 200 observed mating attempts by peripheral males, but only 56% of the attempts by territorial males (N = 43). The selectivity of the females probably increased the genetic representation of the territorial males in the next generation. During the mating season females maintained a dominance hierarchy among themselves. Low ranked females tended to be excluded from preferred mating territories. In this system, both sexes may be subjected to sexual selection. I hypothesize that the ecological factors responsible for the unusual mating system are related to the lack of defendable resources, the iguana's folivory, and the high density of iguanas present in preferred mating areas.

N2  - The status of the type specimens of the 68 new species described in R. Koehler's (1922) publication titled, "Ophiurans of the Philippine Seas and Adjacent Waters" is reviewed. Koehler designated type specimens in only a few new species. A.H. Clark translated Koehler's manuscript from French to English, and he attempted to make up for deficiencies in designation of types by adding to the paper a list of types "designated by the museum" (USNM). Clark was inconsistent in selecting specimens that he had designated as types, and the problems were compounded by an abundance of clerical errors, unnecessary recataloging of specimens, and inclusion of the same specimens in more than one species description. An attempt is made here to resolve discrepancies, and correct the status of the types of Koehler's new species. Tables are provided to demonstrate how Koehler's original text was corrected. Two taxonomic actions are included herein; new lectotype specimens are designated for Ophiothrix cumulata Koehler and Ophiomusium facundum Koehler.

N2  - Included in this report are new distribution records and descriptions of 44 species of Polynoidae distributed between two subfamilies: Lepidonotinae, with Hermenia verruculosa Grube and Lepidonopsis humilis (Augener); and Harmothoinae, with Subadyte pellucida (Ehlers), and three species and one new combination of Hololepidella Willey. The study includes a replacement of Malmgrenia McIntosh, 1874 (= indeterminable) with Malmgreniella Hartman, 1967, emended, with a redescription of M. dicirra Hartman, 1967, the type species, and a review and revision of the species that have been referred to Malmgrenia, resulting in 13 new combinations (with 2 new synonyms) and 19 new species of Malmgreniella. In addition, three new genera are added, including Paragattyana, for P. micropoides (Augener), new combination, and P. intesi, new species; Rullieriella, for R. monoechinata (Rullier), new combination, with synonym Parahalosydna chryostictus Hutchings and Rainer; and Wilsoniella for W. furcosetosa (Loshamn), new combination. Most of the species show a more or less close association with other invertebrates, including echinoderms (ophiuroids, spatangoid echinoids, synaptid holothurians), coelenterates (hydrocorals), and other polychaetes (arenicolids, terebellids, and chaetopterids).

N2  - The phylogenetic relationships of spider families classically placed in the superfamily Lycosoidea, which posses a grate-shaped tapetum in some or all of the indirect eyes, are examined through exemplar taxa scored for 68 classical or newly elaborated characters. A derived calamistrum, which forms an oval to rectangular patch, is considered a synapomorphy uniting the Lycosoidea and several other genera formerly placed in the Tengellidae and Miturgidae. In the resulting analysis the Lycosoidea are shown to be monophyletic and the Tengellidae and Miturgidae polyphyletic. The Senoculidae, Oxyopidae, Stiphidiidae, and Psechridae form a monophyletic group. The monophyly of the Lycosidae, Trechaleidae (including Rhoicininae), Pisauridae plus Dolomedidae, and Zoropsidae are confirmed, whereas monophyly of the Ctenidae, Machadoniinae, and Uliodoninae are called into question.

N2  - Species of Hecamede, which now number 12, are revised. New synonyms are as follows (the junior synonym is listed first): Hecamede grisescens Becker is conspecific with Notiphila albicans Meigen, Hecamede affinis Canzoneri and Meneghini is conspecific with Hecamede brasiliensis Cresson, Hecamede lacteipennis Lamb is conspecific with Notiphila granifera Thomson, and Hemicyclops maculipleuris de Meijere is conspecific with Hecamede planifrons de Meijere. The following new species are described (type localities are noted in parentheses): Hecamede (Hecamede) africana (Kenya. 100 km N Mombasa), H. (H.) australis (Australia. New South Wales: Deewhy), H. (H.) maritima (Egypt. Sinai: Nabk), H. (H.) socotra (South Yemen. Socotra: RÃ¡s ShÃ³ab), H. (Soikia) tomentosa (Nigeria. Lagos), H. (S.) bocki (Australia. New South Wales: Deewhy). The monophyly of Hecamede within the tribe Hecamedini is demonstrated, and a hypothetical phylogeny of the included species is generated from a matrix of 23 characters. From this phylogeny, a classification of two subgenera (Hecamede and Soikia) is recognized, and in the subgenus Hecamede, two species groups (the planifrons group and the albicans group) are distinguished. All known species of Hecamede and its outgroups are found in the Old World, and the probable origin of the genus also occurred there, specifically within the basin of the Indian Ocean. The two species that occur in the New World appear to have arrived there as part of range expansion. No species occur along the Pacific coast of the New World. Maps, keys to subgenera and species, and illustrations (scanning electron micrographs and line drawings) are provided to assist in the identification of the species.

T1  - Metabolic Adaptation to Climate and Distribution of the Raccoon Procyon lotor and Other Procyonidae

N2  - Although the family Procyonidae is largely a Neotropical group, the North American raccoon, Procyon lotor, is more versatile in its use of climate, and it is found in nearly every habitat from Panama to 60Â°N in Canada. We hypothesized that most contemporary procyonids have remained in tropic and subtropic climates because they have retained the metabolic characteristics of their warm-adapted ancestors, whereas Procyon lotor evolved a different set of adaptations that have enabled it to generalize its use of habitats and climates. To test this hypothesis we compared Procyon lotor with several other procyonids (Bassariscus astutus, Nasua nasua, Nasua narica, Procyon cancrivorus, and Potos flavus) with respect to (1) basal metabolic rate (b), (2) minimum wet thermal conductance (Cmw), (3) diversity of diet (Dd), (4) intrinsic rate of natural increase (rmax), and, where possible, (5) capacity for evaporative cooling (Ec). We measured basal and thermoregulatory metabolism, evaporative water loss, and body temperature of both sexes of Procyon lotor from north central Virginia, in summer and winter. Metabolic data for other procyonids were from literature, as were dietary and reproductive data for all species.Procyon lotor differed from other procyonids in all five variables. (1) Procyon lotor's mass specific b (0.46 mL O2Â·gâˆ’1Â·hâˆ’1) was 1.45 to 1.86 times greater than values for other procyonids. (2) Because of its annual molt, Procyon lotor's Cmw was about 49% higher in summer than winter, 0.0256 and 0.0172 mL O2Â·gâˆ’1Â·hâˆ’1Â·Â°Câˆ’1, respectively. The ratio of measured to predicted Cmw for Procyon lotor in winter (1.15) was similar to values calculated for Potos flavus (1.02) and Procyon cancrivorus (1.25). Values for other procyonids were higher than this, but less than the value for Procyon lotor (1.76) in summer. On a mass specific basis, Bassariscus astutus had the lowest Cmw with a ratio of 0.85. (3) Procyon lotor utilized three times as many food categories as Procyon cancrivorus, Nasua nasua, and Bassariscus astutus; about two times as many as Nasua narica; and nine times as many as Potos flavus. (4) Intrinsic rate of natural increase correlated positively with b. Procyon lotor had the highest rmax (2.52 of expected) and Potos flavus the lowest (0.48 of expected). The other procyonids examined also had low b, but their rmax's were higher than predicted (1.11-1.32 of expected). Early age of first female reproduction, fairly large litter size, long life span, high-quality diet, and, in one case, female social organization all compensated for low b and elevated rmax. (5) Although data on the capacity for evaporative cooling were incomplete, this variable appeared to be best developed in Procyon lotor and Bassariscus astutus, the two species that have been most successful at including temperate climates in their distributions.These five variables are functionally interrelated, and have co-evolved in each species to form a unique adaptive unit that regulates body temperature and energy balance throughout each annual cycle. The first four variables were converted into normalized dimensionless numbers, which were used to derive a composite score that represented each species' adaptive unit. Procyon lotor had the highest composite score (1.47) and Potos flavus the lowest (0.39). Scores for the other procyonids were intermediate to these extremes (0.64-0.79). There was a positive correlation between the number of climates a species occupies and the magnitude of its composite score. Linear regression of this relationship indicated that 89% of the variance in climatic distribution was attributed to the composite scores. Differences in metabolic adaptation, therefore, have played a role in delimiting climatic distribution of these species.It was clear that Procyon lotor differed from the other procyonids with respect to thermoregulatory ability, diet, and reproductive potential. These differences have enabled it to become a highly successful climate generalist, and its evolution of an b that is higher than the procyonid norm appears to be the cornerstone of its success.

Keys are offered to the families and subfamilies of the superfamily Palaemonoidea, to all recognized genera of the Pontoniinae, Gnathophyllidae, and the genera and species of the Hymenoceridae, to the Indo-Pacific genera of the Palaemoninae, to all species and subspecies of Leander, Leandrites, Leptocarpus, Nematopalaemon, Urocaridella, Anchistus, Coralliocaris, Dasella, Dasycaris, Hamodactylus, Harpiliopsis, Jocaste, Onycocaris, Palaemonella, Paranchistus, and Gnathophyllum, and to the Philippine-Indonesian species of Macrobrachium, Periclimenaeus, and Periclimenes. The following new species are described: Urocaridella vestigialis from Selat Butung, Celebes, Indonesia, in 68 meters; Periclimenes albatrossae from the South China Sea off western Luzon, Philippines, in 315 meters; and Periclimenes calcaratus from Albay Gulf, southeastern Luzon, Philippines, in about 267 meters. The specimen from Kepulauan Kai, Indonesia, identified by Holthuis (1952) as Periclimenaeus truncatus (Rathbun, 1906) proves to be distinct from that species and is designated as the holotype of the new species Periclimenaeus truncoideus.

N2  - Variation was studied in frogs identified as either Leptodactylus podicipinus or L. wagneri as diagnosed in my previous revision of the L. melanonotus species group. Over 6200 adults and juveniles were examined and variation analyses were performed on data from just over 3000 adult and near-adult specimens. The data set consists of a series of three kinds of morphological characters (patterns, structures, measurements), and, when available, advertisement call and habitat data. Intrapopulation variation indicates that variation among the characters studied is extensive within large samples. The intrapopulation variation results are used as a framework to interpret interpopulation and interspecific variation. Study of character variation among sympatric populations typically leads to the following results: (1) when compared side by side, most specimens can be sorted readily into distinct morphotypes representing distinct species; and (2) the variation between sympatric populations is usually distinctive, but not discrete. Advertisement calls in members of this complex appear to contain not only species-coding information, but other information that weakens the utility of calls in assessing species boundaries.The results of this study are used to delimit species for most of the specimens examined. Available material from most of Venezuela is inadequate to evaluate how many species occur there and which of them are conspecific with geographically adjacent species. Thirteen species are diagnosed as a result of this study, including the description of five new species. The recognition of 13 species is conservative and additional information likely will confirm that some of these species are composite.The distributions of most taxa within this complex are expected to be modified significantly by either newly collected specimens or data that will redefine currently recognized (composite) species. Only two distributions are considered robust as the result of this study, those of L. natalensis and L. podicipinus. The provenance of museum specimens collected by Borys Malkin purportedly from IgarapÃ© BelÃ©m, Amazonas, Brazil, is called into question.Unresolved problems are highlighted to encourage and focus further studies to understand the speciation processes and distribution patterns in this complex.

All species, including those under the junior synonym Louisfagea (Fage), are grouped in the genus Pimoa Chamberlin and Ivie. Pimoids are distributed in western North America, southern Europe, and Asia. A numerical cladistic analysis of the interrelationships of the Pimoidae was performed, focusing mainly on classical characters (such as genitalic and somatic morphology) and spinneret spigot morphology. Nine linyphiid species and the genera Tetragnatha and Zygiella were used as outgroups for assessing character polarities. Cladograms hypothesizing the interrelationships of pimoids and the sample of linyphiid taxa are provided. The monophyly of pimoids is confirmed. The Linyphiidae are hypothesized as the sister group of Pimoidae.

N2  - Previously undescribed characters are evaluated and incorporated in a redescription of the Nymphomyiidae (Diptera). The revised family includes seven species, two of which are new. Nymphomyia dolichopeza, new species, is widespread and locally abundant in streams of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains, primarily in North Carolina and Georgia, U.S.A.; and N. holoptica, new species, is recorded from Hong Kong. Based on structural and phylogenetic criteria, the monobasic genera Palaeodipteron Ide and Felicitomyia Kevan are new synonyms of Nymphomyia Tokunaga. Larval, pupal, and adult characters were used to reconstruct the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of world species of Nymphomyia. Based primarily on adult features, Nymphomyia is divided into two species groups with the following phylogenetic relationship: (1) alba group (alba + (levanidovae + rohdendorfi)); and (2) walkeri group ((walkeri + dolichopeza) + (brundini + holoptica)). Several compelling characters help define the eastern Palaearctic alba group, and others provide strong evidence that the Oriental species brundini and holoptica are monophyletic. Although data suggest that the Nearctic fauna (walkeri and dolichopeza) is monophyletic, the cladistic basis for this hypothesis is relatively weak (two reductive characters). Keys to larvae, pupae, and adults and a discussion of collection techniques, ecological data, and distributions are provided.

N2  - The species of Creagrutus GÃ¼nther occuring to the west and north of the Andean Cordilleras in Venezuela, Colombia, and Panama are revised. Eight species are recognized: Creagrutus affinis Steindachner (1880) distributed from the RÃ­o Magdalena west into central Panama and southwest to the RÃ­o San Juan of the Pacific slope of Colombia; Creagrutus brevipinnis Eigenmann (1913) and Creagrutus caucanus Eigenmann (1913) of the RÃ­o Cauca in northwestern Colombia; Creagrutus hildebrandi Schultz (1944b) of the Lago Maracaibo basin and coastal rivers draining into the southeastern portion of the Golfo de Venezuela; Creagrutus magdalenae Eigenmann (1913) of the RÃ­o Magdalena in northern Colombia; Creagrutus maracaiboensis (Schultz, 1944b) known from western and southern tributaries to Lago Maracaibo; Creagrutus nigrostigmatus Dahl (1960) known only from CaÃ±o PechilÃ­n, a small drainage basin on the Caribbean coast of Colombia in the state of Sucre; and Creagrutus paralacus, new species, from southern tributaries to Lago Maracaibo.Two specimens of an undescribed species (not formally treated in this paper) from the upper RÃ­o Magdalena that are very similar to Creagrutus paralacus are discussed.Creagrutops Schultz (1944b) is considered a synonym of Creagrutus GÃ¼nther. Four species are placed into the synonymy of Creagrutus affinis: Creagrutus leuciscus Regan (1913), Creagrutus londonoi Fowler (1945), Creagrutus notropoides Meek and Hildebrand (1912), and Creagrutus simus Meek and Hildebrand (1913).Records of Creagrutus beni from the Lago Maracaibo system (Schultz, 1944b) and from the RÃ­o Magdalena (Dahl, 1971) and Creagrutus cf. caucanus from the RÃ­o Negro of the Amazon basin (Goulding et al., 1988) are erroneous. A key is provided to the Creagrutus species of trans-Andean South America. A neotype is designated for Creagrutus nigrostigmatus Dahl and lectotypes for Creagrutus affinis and Creagrutus leuciscus.

N2  - Twenty-three species of Tachysphex are recorded from Sri Lanka. Nine previously known species are redescribed, and the following new species are described: anthracinus Pulawski (Sri Lanka), chiastotrichus Pulawski (Sri Lanka), crinitus Pulawski (Sri Lanka), diadelus Pulawski (Sri Lanka), drymobius Pulawski (Sri Lanka), eucharistus Pulawski (Sri Lanka), gryllivorus Pulawski (Nepal, Sri Lanka), haematopus Pulawski (Sri Lanka), indicus Pulawski (southern India, Sri Lanka), noar Pulawski (Sri Lanka), oxychelus Pulawski (Sri Lanka), sri Pulawski (Sri Lanka), sympleuron Pulawski (India, Sri Lanka), and xanthoptesimus Pulawski (southern India, Sri Lanka). Other species known from lowland India, Burma, and Thailand, are redescribed in the Appendix, and two new species are described: actites Pulawski from Thailand and rugicauda Pulawski from India. A key for all of the species treated is provided. Newly synonymized names are: Tachysphex consocius mookonis Tsuneki, 1972, =  nitidissimus de Beaumont, 1952; Tachysphex grandii de Beaumont, 1965, =  consocius Kohl, 1892; Tachysphex collaris Kohl, 1898, and lanatus Arnold, 1947, =  mediterraneus Kohl, 1883; Tachysphex egregius Arnold, 1924, =  plicosus (A. Costa, 1867); Tachytes flavogeniculatus Taschenberg, 1880, =  Tachysphex erythropus (Spinola, 1839); Tachysphex lugubris Arnold, 1924, rugosus Gussakovskij, 1952, and quadrifurci Pulawski, 1971, =  minutus Nurse, 1909; Tachysphex peculator Nurse, 1909, =  albocinctus (Lucas, 1849); Tachysphex schmiedeknechti satanas Pulawski, 1971, =  schmiedeknechti Kohl, 1883; Tachysphex tinctipennis Cameron, 1904, =  morosus (F. Smith, 1858); and karooensis Arnold, 1923, and foucauldi de Beaumont, 1952, =  vulneratus R. Turner, 1917. The following taxa, previously regarded as subspecies of Tachysphex panzeri (Vander Linden, 1829), are newly synonymized with the latter: Lyrops rufiventris Spinola, 1839, Tachytes oraniensis Lepeletier, 1845, Tachytes pulverosus Radoszkowski, 1886, Tachysphex panzeri fortunatus de Beaumont, 1968, Tachysphex panzeri cyprius Pulawski, 1971, and Tachysphex panzeri sareptanus Pulawski, 1971. A neotype is designated for Tachytes discolor Frivaldszky, 1877 (a junior synonym of Tachysphex panzeri (Vander Linden, 1829)). The species group classification for the genus is abandoned because of intermediate species. Tachysphex vulneratus R. Turner, previously known from Africa, is first recorded from India and Thailand; lagunaensis Tsuneki, described from the Philippines, is recorded from Laos and Thailand; and panzeri (Vander Linden), known from the western Palearctic to the Indian subcontinent, is recorded from Thailand. Original behavioral data are presented for consocius, drymobius, gryllivorus, indicus, morosus, panzeri, and sympleuron.

A comparison of the sensory bristle of the male 1st antenna of species of Rutiderma and Scleraner in the Rutidermatidae indicates that the extent of coverage of the bristle by filaments may be useful in separating males of the two genera. A study of medial sclerites of the protopodites of second antennae indicates that the Cypridinidae and Cylindroleberididae fall into one group, and the Philomedidae, Sarsiellidae, and Rutidermatidae into a second group. Some information is given on eggs, juvenile morphology, parastic copepods, and gut contents. Eye size is compared to depth. A new subfamily, Metaschismatinae in the Rutidermatidae, is proposed.

N2  - The Recent nominal species belonging to the hydrobiid snail genus Pyrgulopsis Call and Pilsbry, 1886, are reviewed. Pyrgulopsis is a large group of 65 Recent species inhabiting diverse inland waters of North America. This genus is distinguished from other members of the subfamily Nymphophilinae by the combination of small size; generally simple, ovate-conic shell; and penis ornamented with relatively few glands.Members of this genus have a globose to elongate-conic shell with near smooth to strongly punctate protoconch, smooth or rarely carinate teleoconch, and simple apertural lip often loosened from the body whorl. The taenioglossate radula features a central radular tooth with well-developed lateral angles, narrow basal process, and, usually, a single pair of basal cusps. The operculum generally is paucispiral with eccentric nucleus. The ventral operculum is notable for its variably thickened attachment scar margin and central callus. The caecal chamber of the stomach is variably developed. Animal pigmentation is variable, sometimes including dark stripes along the mantle. Cephalic tentacle ciliation generally is weak. The gonads usually are of simple lobes, and sometimes overlap the stomach. The prostate gland usually has a small pallial section and the vas deferens usually exits from the gland sub-terminally. The penis is generally large and distally bifid; with a terminal filament bearing the vas deferens, and accessory lobe (sometimes absent). The penis surface is very weakly ciliated and is variably ornamented with dorsal and ventral glands. The albumen gland usually has a small pallial section. The capsule gland is almost always bipartite, and contains a well-developed ventral channel. The genital aperture is either simple or opens to an anterior vestibule. The coiled oviduct usually is simple, and joins the bursal duct just behind, to well anterior to, the pallial wall. Both bursa copulatrix and seminal receptacle usually are present, the former being larger and often at least partly posterior to the albumen gland. The bursal duct is of variable size and shape, and often embedded, sometimes deeply so, within the albumen gland. The seminal receptacle is usually just behind the coiled oviduct and typically has a short duct. Females are oviparous, and lay single, hemispherical egg capsules.A cladistic analysis of relationships among 60 species was conducted using Nymphophilus Taylor as single outgroup. Monophyly of Pyrgulopsis was supported by 15 character-state transformations, including six non-homoplasious synapomorphies. Four large clades were recognized: a group of nine species distributed in Mississippi River drainage and other waters to the east, a group of six species from southern Nevada and southeastern Arizona; a group of 10 species from eastern California, northern Arizona, and Snake River drainage; and a group of 18 species scattered throughout the West. The remaining 17 western taxa included four species occupying basal positions on the cladogram, a poorly resolved group of eight species, and two small clades consisting of two species from northern Arizona; and three widely disjunct species from northern Mexico, Snake River drainage, and southeastern California.The following genera herein are added to the list of junior subjective synonyms of Pyrgulopsis: Savaginius Taylor, 1966a, Apachecoccus Taylor, 1987, and Yaquicoccus Taylor, 1987. Fluminicola avernalis carinifera Pilsbry, 1935, is elevated to full species status hereinâ€”this and fifteen other species are newly allocated to Pyrgulopsis. Fontelicella pinetorum Taylor, 1987, is a junior subjective synonym of Pyrgulopsis kolobensis (Taylor, 1987); and Pyrgulopsis wabashensis Hinkley, 1908a, is a junior subjective synonym of Pyrgulopsis scalariformis (Wolf, 1869). A new name, Pyrgulopsis bryantwalkeri, is proposed for Fluminicola nevadensis Walker, 1916 (not Pyrgula nevadensis Stearns, 1883).

N2  - We observed courtship and aggressive behavior in males of 13 species in four families of earwigs in order to determine the functional significance of sexually dimorphic morphology of cerci and associated structures in males. Criteria for determining function included appropriateness of design and consistency of use. In 12 species, at least 17 secondary sexual modifications of male cerci and associated structures appeared to serve in aggressive interactions between males, as weapons and/or as display devices. In two species, modifications of male cerci served to clasp females just prior to and during copulation; in one case, they were used to force copulations on females; in the other, they apparently were used as a courtship device. Functions could not be assigned confidently to many minor features, such as positions of teeth on the cerci.

N2  - The 119 species of temperate North Pacific azooxanthellate Scleractinia are described or diagnosed in two separate accounts: the 25 species known to occur in the temperate northeastern Pacific and the 102 species known to occur in the temperate northwestern Pacific, there being only eight species in common. Three genera, six species, and one species subspecies are described as new; nine new combinations are suggested; and 28 new records for the northern temperate regions are reported. A neotype for Desmophyllum dianthus (Esper, 1794) is designated. A dichotomous key to the temperate northeastern Pacific Scleractinia is provided, as well as a key to the seven species of northwestern Pacific Truncatoflabellum. Separate historical resumes are discussed and tabularized for the northwestern temperate faunas. The study is based on new material from a variety of sources, but primarily from the cruises of the Albatross (USNM) and the R/V Tansei Maru (ORI), and the collections of the California Academy of Sciences, Royal British Columbia Museum, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.The region covered in this account extendes form Bahia Magdalena on the Pacific coast of Baja California to Formosa Strait, off China, including two warm temperate provinces (California and Japan) and four cold temperate provinces (Oregon, Aleutian, Oriental, and Kurile). The most species-rich temperate region is the warm temperate northwestern Pacific Japan Province, which contains 92 azooxanthellate species. This province is directly adjacent to the even more species-rich Indo-West Pacific tropical region from which it receives many tropical and eurythermic tropical species via the warm, northerly flowing Kuroshio Current. Azooxanthellate species diversity decreases with higher latitude: 106 species occur in the combined warm temperate North Pacific provinces, 37 in the lower boreal provinces (Oregon and Oriental), and only 14 species occur in the combined upper boreal provinces (Aleutian and Kurile). The northernmost record of a scleractinian coral in the North Pacific is Caryophyllia arnoldi from Prince William Sound (60Â°48'N) in the Aleutian Province. This province also holds the record for the deepest living scleractinian coral, Fungiacyathus marenzelleri, at 6328 m in the Aleutian Trench.

N2  - The study of new material and the use of additional characters, including the sensory pores, of Stathmonotus corroborates the taxonomic assignment of Springer (1955). The osteology of S. (Parastathmonotus) sinuscalifornici is described, illustrated, and compared to that of the other five species of Stathmonotus. A key, distribution maps, color descriptions, and illustrations for all species are given.The Chaenopsidae of Stephens (1963) is expanded, based primarily on osteological characters, to include Neoclinus, Mccoskerichthys, and Stathmonotus. The expanded family is characterized by at least eight apomorphies, but its outgroup relationships are uncertain. Character evidence supporting the monophyly of the included taxa (Neoclinus, Mccoskerichthys, Stathmonotus, and the Chaenopsinae) is presented. Parsimony analysis of 61 morphological characters resulted in two most-parasimonious trees of relationships within the Chaenopsidae (differing only in the relationships of S. sinuscalifornici). Neoclinus is hypothesized to be the sister group of the remainder of the Chaenopsidae. Mccoskerichthys is hypothesized to be the sister group of a clade comprising Stathmonotus and the Chaenopsinae (= Chaenopsidae of Stephens, 1963). Within Stathmonotus, S. stahli and S. gymnodermis are hypothesized to form a monophyletic group (subgenus Auchenistius) that is the sister group of the remaining four species. Stathmonotus hemphilli is hypothesized to be the sister group of the remaining three species (subgenus Parastathmonotus). Within Parastathmonotus, S. lugubris and S. culebrai are hypothesized to be sister species. An equally parsimonious topology places S. sinuscalifornici as the sister species of S. hemphilli. Character support for these relationships is discussed, a classification of the Chaenopsidae is presented, and the biogeography of Stathmonotus is discussed.

T1  - The Intermuscular Bones and Ligaments of Teleostean Fishes
JO  - Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology
SN  - 0081-0282

EP  - 85

N2  - Intermuscular bones are found only in teleostean fishes. They are segmental ossifications in the myosepta and generally are associated with ligaments. That association takes three forms: ontogenetic or structural continuity, when intermuscular bones ossify within ligament and/or are attached to the axial skeleton by ligament: serial homology, when a series of bones is continued rostrally or caudally by series of ligaments; and homology, when a series of bones in one teleost is homologous with a series of ligaments in another. We recongnize three series of intermusculars, epineurals, epicentrals, and epipleurals. Epineurals and epicentrals develop in a rostrocadual gradient, whereas epipleurals develop rostrally and caudally from the region of the first caudal vertebra. We create a notation for recording the distribution and form of intermuscular bones and ligaments, and we map them in about 125 genera of teleosts from over 100 families, covering all major groups. The primitive state of Recent teleostean intermusculars is exemplified by Hiodon, in which all ossified epineurals are fused with the neural arches, and all epicentrals and epipleurals are ligaments. Some or all epineural bones are free (unfused) from the neural arches in other teleosts, and in many lower (nonacanthomorph) elopocephalans they develop an anteroventral branch so that they are forked proximally. Epineurals are primitively dorsolaterally directed, but the first one to three are deflected ventrally in a few nonacathomorphs (argentinoids, some aulopiforms, Neoscopelus) and in lamipridiform acanthomorphs. In polymixia, the first epineural is displaced ventrally into the horizontal septum, and in all other acanthomorphs several or all epineurals are so displaced; the bones generally called epipleurals in acanthomorphs are epineurals. Epicentrals lie in the horizontal septum and are primitively ligamentous. There are ossified epicentrals in Notopterus, Megalops, clupeiforms, gonorychiforms, gymnotoids, Thymallus, and the aulopiforms Parasudis, Alepisaurus, and Omosudis. Epicentral ligaments sometimes include a cartilage rod distally (salmonoids, osmeroids, Maurolicus, Polymixia), and in many clupeoids the distal tip of each anterior epicentral bone is associated with a separate superficial chevron of cartilage. Anterior epicentrals are lacking in some aulopiforms and among acanthomorphs in beryciforms, some zeiforms, and primitive percomorphs, so that the series of ligaments begins on the posterior abdominal vertebrae. All epicentrals are absent in some aulopiforms, in all examined paracanthopterygians and stephanoberyciforms, and in many percomorphs. A series of segmental, anterolaterally directed ligaments, "POTs," attaches to epicentrals in the horizontal septum of many teleosts. In percomorphs and zeiforms the anterior POTs acquire a new association, attaching to epineural bones secondarily positioned in the horizontal septum. Epipleurals lie below the horizontal septum and are posteroventrally directed. There are ossified epipleurals in Heterotis, elopomorphs, clupeomorphs, esocoids, ostariophysans, argentinoids, stomiiforms, aulopiforms, myctophiforms, and Polymixia. Like the epineurals, in many lower (nonacanthomorph) elopocephalan teleosts the epipleural bones develop an anterodorsal branch so that they are forked proximally. Epipleurals are unossified in salmonoids and osmeroids (except Spirinchus and some galaxiines), and this, together with cartilaginous epicentrals in those groups, indicates that they are sister groups. Aulopiforms are uniquely characterized by attached epipleurals that extend forward to the first or second vertebra. In many aulopiforms, the anterior epipleurals are displaced dorsally into the horizontal septum, the reverse of the acanthomorph situation (epineurals displaced ventrally), and in most aulopiforms the primitive bidirectional pattern of epipleural development is replaced by a rostrocaudal gradient. The epipleural series is lost in all acanthomorphs except Polymixia and holocentrids. The distribution and structure of ribs and Baudelot's ligament also are mapped. The potential systematic value of the intermusculars is illustrated by a parsimony analysis of Aulopiformes, and intermuscular characters of many other groups are enumerated.

Each account includes the name, author, date of description, genus, computer reference number, citation, collection locality, host species, date of collection, and collector, if known. The kind of primary type and its sex are designated, accompanied by the USNM type number. The remarks section includes the current status of the name and other pertinent information. Of these accounts, 63 names are junior synonyms, one of which is synonymized here. Of the remaining 354 valid taxa, nine primary types are in the Natural History Museum, London, although for various reasons they warrant further discussion. Twenty-seven lectotypes are designated. Five appendices are included. They are an alphabetical index of host/parasite names by species; a list of junior synonyms and their equivalents; a list of type localities by country and the species described from them; an alphabetical list of the valid genera, species, and subspecies represented by primary types in the collection, including their USNM numbers; and the supraspecific classification of the Siphonaptera.

A study of the relationship between carapace length of ovigerous females and egg length indicates that egg length varies directly with carapace length in the Cypridinidae, and probably also in the Cylindrolebrididae and Sarsiellinae, and possibly in the Philomedidae. Isopod parasites were found in one philomedid ostracode and choniostomatid copepods in some sarsiellids.

T1  - A Revision of New World Cyamops Melander (Diptera; Periscelididae)

N2  - The New World species of the genus Cyamops Melander, now numbering eight, are revised. New species (type locality in parenthesis): C. americus (Mexico. Chiapas: El Triunfo (49 km S Jaltenango, 1300-2000 m)), C. buenorum (Mexico, Chiapas: Cacahoatan (7 km N)), C. fasciatus (Brazil. SÃ£o Paulo: Serra da Cantareira, Chapado), and C. colombianus (Colombia. Rio Raposo). Cyamops, with Stenomicra Colquillett as its apparent sister group, is placed in the subfamily Stenomicrinae, which is recharacterized. Planinasus Cresson, previously thought to be related to genera within Stenomicrinae, is shown to be more closely related to Periscelidinae. The monophyly of Cyamops is clearly demonstrated, as is that for some species groups within the genus. The relationships between species group, however, are not well known. Phylogenetic studies, even for the fauna of the New World, are hindered by inadequate specimens to investigate many of the characters we have identified. Maps, keys to species, detailed distribution data, and illustration (scanning electron micrographs and line drawings) are provided to assist in the identification of the species.

T1  - The Neotropical Fish Family Ctenoluciidae (Teleostei: Ostariophysi: Characiformes); Supra and Intrafamilial Phylogenetic Relationships, with a Revisionary Study

N2  - Osteological and soft anatomical features of the species of the Neotropical characiform family Ctenoluciidae and other characiforms were studied to examine the hypothesis that the family was monophyletic, and to advance an hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships within the family and of the Ctenoluciidae to proximate outgroups. A series of derived features corroborate the hypothesis of monophyly of the Ctenoluciidae and are congruent with the hypothesis that the Ctenoluciidae and Erythrinidae are sister groups. A less-extensive series of derived features indicate that the African family Hepsetidae is the sister group of the clade formed by the Ctenoluciidae and Erythrinidae, with the Neotrophical family Lebiasinidae the sister group to the clade formed by those three families. Shared derived features of a variety of body systems define phylogenetic subunits of the Ctenoluciidae and characterize the majority of its species. The ctenoluciid genera Ctenolucius Gill (1861) and Boulengerella Eigenmann (1903) are defined as monophyletic units.Luciocharax Steindachner (1878) and Belonocharax Fowler (1907) are considered synonyms of Ctenolucius, with Spixostoma Whitley (1951) placed as a synonym of Boulengerella.Two species are recognized in Ctenolucius. Ctenolucius hujeta (Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1894) ranges from the Lago Maracaibo basin of northwestern Venezuela through the RÃ­o Magdalena system to the RÃ­o SinÃº of northwestern Colombia. Ctenolucius beani (Fowler, 1907) occurs in the RÃ­o Atrato and RÃ­o San Juan basins of northwestern Colombia and the rivers of the Pacific slopes of Panama as far west as Veraguas Province. Luciocharax insculptus Steindachner (1878) is a synonym of C. hujeta, and Luciocharax striatus Boulenger (1911) is a synonym of C. beani.Five species are recognized in Boulengerella.  Boulengerella lateristriga (Boulenger, 1895) occurs in the RÃ­o Negro drainage of the Amazon basin in Brazil and Venezuela and uppermost portions of the RÃ­o Orinoco in southern Venezuela. Boulengerella maculata (Valenciennes in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1849) is widely distributed through the Rio Amazonas, Rio Tocantins, and RÃ­o Orinoco basins. Boulengerella lucius (Cuvier, 1819) occurs in the Rio Amazonas and RÃ­o Orinoco systems. Boulengerella cuvieri (Agassiz in Spix and Agassiz, 1829) is widespread through the RÃ­o Orinoco, Rio Amazonas, and Rio Tocantins basins, the Essequibo river of Guyana, the Oyapock River along the boundary between French Guiana and Brazil, and the coastal rivers of AmapÃ¡ and ParÃ¡ states in Brazil. Boulengerella xyrekes, new species, a relatively rare form, inhabits the RÃ­o Orinoco and Rio Amazonas basins. Xiphostoma taedo Cope (1872) is a synonym of B. maculata, Xiphostoma oseryi Castelnau (1855) and Xiphostoma ocellatum Schomburgk (1841) are considered synonyms of B. cuvieri. Xiphostoma longipinne Steindachner (1876), based on a juvenile from the mouth of the Rio Negro in Brazil, tentatively is considered a synonym of B. cuvieri. Reports of Boulengerella from the Rio ParnaÃ­ba of northeastern Brazil and in the RÃ­o de La Plata system in Argentina either are based on specimens with questionable locality data or are probable misidentifications.Keys are provided to distinguish Ctenolucius and Boulengerella and for the species in each genus. Lectotypes are designated for Xiphostoma hujeta Valenciennes, Luciocharax insculptus Steindachner, Xiphostoma ocellatum Valenciennes, and Luciocharax striatus Boulenger.The phylogenetic biogeography of the group indicates a vicariance event between the Hepsetidae and the lineage consisting of the Ctenoluciidae and Erythrinidae associated with, or predating, the final separation of Africa and South America about 85 mya. Fossil and distributional data indicate that major cladogenesis within the Ctenoluciidae and Erythrinidae predates the late Miocene.

T1  - The Indo-West Pacific Blenniid Fish Genus Istiblennius Reappraised: A Revision of Istiblennius, Blenniella, and Paralticus, New Genus

N2  - Istiblennius Whitley, as most recently defined (Smith-Vaniz and Springer, 1971), comprises 2 monophyletic groups of species, which we recognize as separate genera, Blenniella Reid (9 species) and Istiblennius (14 species). A cladistic analysis supports the hypothesis that Blenniella and Istiblennius form a clade. The 14 species of Istiblennius include 2 new species: I. pox, from southernmost Red Sea, Persian Gulf, Gulf of Oman, and I. spilotus, from most of East African coast, Comoro Islands, Madagascar, Gulf of Oman, and Pakistan. A monotypic new genus, Paralticus, is described for Salarias amboninensis Bleeker, which had been assigned most recently (Smith-Vaniz and Springer, 1971) to Praealticus Schultz and Chapman. Although superficially similar to Istiblennius species, P. amboinensis is a member of a clade that also comprises Praealticus, Alticus, and Andamia.Most of the species we revise exhibit statistically significant meristic sexual dimorphism, as well as noticeable geographic variation. All species are illustrated, including both sexes, individual and geographic variants, and ophioblennius stage prejuveniles (for all 5 species for which these stages are known). Distribution maps for all species are presented.Cladistic analyses are given for a subset of the genera of the tribe Salariini, to which the 3 genera we revise belong, and for the species of Blenniella and Istiblennius. The generic level analysis corroborates a major portion of the analysis proposed by Williams (1990). Because of character variability, we consider the results of the generic analyses highly tentative.Discussions of the biogeography of the genera and species are presented. The Philippine Islands are noted as a general area of endemism for fishes and an explanation is proposed. The pattern of east-west disjunctly distributed species, or sister species, first noted by Springer and Williams (1990), is modified slightly and shown to be common one for fishes. The western portion of the disjunct distributions appears to be restricted to the western Indian Ocean south of the equator and west of the mid-Indian Ocean Ridge. Some species that are not disjunctly distributed are limited in distribution to the same area of the Indian Ocean as the western disjunct portions of other species. The area of disjunction almost always includes, at least, the Gulf of Thailand and the southern half of the South China Sea.

A supplementary description is given of Danielopolina wilkensi (Hartmann, 1985) based on new material from the type locality (Lanzarote lava tube), including the first description of the adult male and juveniles. This is the first report of two different species of Danielopolina living in the same anchialine habitat. An emended description is given for the family Thaumatocyprididae, and an emended diagnosis is given for the genus Danielopolina. Taxonomic keys are presented for living genera of Thaumatocyprididae and for species of Danielopolina. The origin of anchialine populations, shell ornamentation of fossil and living Thaumatocyprididae, and sexual dimorphism and ontogeny in species of Danielopolina are discussed.

Six new species are described, illustrated, and compared with their nearest relatives: Eurycyde arctica, Eurycyde depressa, Eurycyde muricata, Pycnogonum stylidium, Nymphon hirsutum, and Colossendeis dalli. Four additional species inadequately described by W.H. Hilton (1942) are redescribed fully and illustrated as if new: Achelia megova, Achelia ovosetosa, Pallenopsis (Bathypallenopsis) pacifica, and Colossendeis microsetosa. New distribution data and a diagnosis are given for the other 25 species, and new morphological information is included for each species where applicable. Several specimens are identified only to Nymphon or Pycnogonum for lack of adults or recognizable specimens.

Milne Edwards. As a result, the genus now contains five species, four of which are known only from the Caribbean Sea, and one of which is from the tropical eastern Pacific. A critical review of all species of Xylopagurus, and a discussion of unusual or unique features, are presented. The two new species, X. anthonii and X. tenuis, are described. A redescription of the type species of the genus, Xylopagurus rectus A. Milne Edwards, sensu stricto, is included, as well as diagnoses of X. cancellarius Walton and X. tayrona Lemaitre and Campos. A key for the identification of the species is presented. With the exception of the recently described X. tayrona, all species are fully illustrated, and complete synonymies are presented.

T1  - Monophyly and Phylogenetic Diagnosis of the Family Cetopsidae, with Synonymization of the Helogenidae (Teleostei: Siluriformes)

N2  - The Neotropical catfishes currently recognized as the families Cetopsidae and Helogenidae are hypothesized to be sister groups. The two taxa share numerous synapomorphies, including a lap joint between the opercle and interopercle, a dorsal displacement of the attachment of the interoperculo-mandibular ligament on the interopercle, and a strongly depressed palatine. Some of these derived characters are unique within Siluriformes. On the basis of this hypothesis of relationships, cetopsids and helogenids are united into an expanded Cetopsidae, itself subdivided into the monophyletic subfamilies Cetopsinae and Helogeninae. The Cetopsinae is synapomorphically diagnosable by, among other characters, an expanded and often ramified cartilaginous posterior process of the basipterygium, an anterior curvature of the third epibranchial, and the articulation of the palatine with the neurocranium only by means of its anterior cartilage. Synapomorphies supporting the monophyly of the Helogeninae include a reduction in the degree of ossification between the mesethmoid cornua and the remainder of the neurocranium, a large paired fontanel in frontal and sphenotic, the posterior expansion of the third basibranchial, and the lack of contact of the sphenotic with the supraoccipital. Phylogenetic diagnoses are provided for the redefined Cetopsidae, Cetopsinae, and Helogeninae. The external morphology of juvenile Helogenes and a number of unusual juvenile features, possibly unique to the genus, are described for the first time.

N2  - Thirty-four species (31 new and one left in open nomenclature) of benthic Myodocopina in 16 genera (one new) collected at depths of 204-2900 m on the SE Australian continental slope under the auspices of the Museum of Victoria and Victorian Institute of Marine Sciences, Australia, are described and illustrated. Including species in Parts 1-3, six are parasitized by Isopoda and 12 by Copepoda, and a few specimens have foraminiferans and bryozoans attached to the outer side of the carapaces. The relationship between eye development and water depth in the Myodocopina is discussed; in the collection from Australia about 72% of the species at bathyal depths (201-2000 m) and 25% at abyssal depths (2001+ m) have lateral eyes. Predators are more abundant in the upper part of the bathyal zone (201-500 m) than in deeper waters. Diversity is higher on the Australian slope than in other geographic areas where diversity is known, and it is highest in the upper part of the bathyal zone.

Each genus is diagnosed, depicted in a dorsal habitus drawing of its type species, and accompanied by a list of currently included species with additions and changes published subsequent to the Drake and Ruhoff (1965) catalog. Where practical at this time, a key to the species within some of the genera is offered.Fossil forms are excluded except for three fossil species cataloged in modern genera: For two species of the Cantacaderini genus Cantacader, the new genus Paleocader is proposed with the new combinations Paleocader avitus (Drake) (type species) and P. quinquecarinatus (Germar and Berendt); the Phatnomatini species Phatnoma baltica Drake is transferred to the new combination Sinalda baltica.In the tribe Cantacaderini, the following generic changes have been made since the Drake and Ruhoff (1965a) catalog: increase from five genera to 10; present transfer of the genus Carldrakeana Froeschner from the tribe Phatnomatini; description of the new genus Paleocader for two fossil species (see paragraph above); and earlier transfers into Cantacaderini from Phatnomatini of Cyperobia Bergroth, Pseudophatnoma BlÃ¶te, and Stenocader Drake and Hambleton. For genera within the Cantacaderini keys to two species of Allocader Drake, three species of Carldrakeana, two species of Ceratocader Drake, and two species of Pseudophatnoma are provided herein.In the tribe Phatnomatini generic changes since the Drake and Ruhoff catalog are as follows: herein description of two new genera, Etesinalda for type and only species, E. laticosta, new species, from the Island of SÃ£o Tome and Exulmus for Ulmus engaeus Drake and Ruhoff, type and only species, with new combination Exulmus engaeus; two genera described elsewhere by Froeschner, Carldrakeana, Distocader; eight by Pericart, Daillea, Indocader, Microcader, Phatnomella, Pseudacalypta, Pullocader, Taphnoma, Thaicader; one by Stusak, Phatnocader; three genera transferred to Cantacaderini (see above); redefinition of Gonycentrum Bergroth, with Sinalda Distant elevated from synonymy; Minitingis Barber elevated from synonymy; and Phatnoma baltica Drake herein transferred to genus Sinalda. Within the tribe Phatnomatini keys to two species of Eocader Drake and Hambleton, two species of Gonycentrum Bergroth, two species of Indocader, three species of Microcader, two species of Minitingis Barber, four species of Plesionoma Drake, four species of Taphnoma, three species of Ulmus Distant, two species of Zetekella Drake are provided herein.

N2  - This study treats the putative type specimens included in all the families of blennioid fishes, except those of the Blenniidae (which were treated previously), known or believed to have been deposited in the USNM collections and whose descriptions were published prior to 1 December 1995. These include 2365 specimens in 415 lots, which comprise 112 holotypes, eight lectotypes, three neotypes, 14 syntypes, 2215 paratypes, and 13 paralectotypes of 222 nominal species and subspecies. Among the eight lectotypes, the following are designated by us in the present study: Emblemaria markii Mowbray, Cryptotrema corallinum Gilbert; Labrosomus xanti Gill; and Tripterygion ellioti, Herre (located in the California Academy of Sciences, CAS-SU 38840). The holotypes or syntypes of five other nominal species that were, or could expected to be, deposited in the USNM collections appear to be lost, and the holotype of one other species has been exchanged. We list each nominal taxon together with its original literature citation and, for primary types, include published collecting associated data and length measurements. USNM accession numbers, where known, are given for all types. Discrepancies between original descriptions and putative types are discussed, as well as miscellaneous other relevant problems encountered during the course of preparing this listing.

N2  - A series of synapomorphies for the characiform family Chilodontidae, in addition to those proposed by Vari (1983), are discussed. These involve modifications of the suspensorium, hyoid arch, infraorbitals, lower jaw, supraorbital portion of the laterosensory canal system in the frontal, and lateral-line scales. The chilodontid genera Chilodus MÃ¼ller and Troschel (1844) and Caenotropus GÃ¼nther (1864) are diagnosed as monophyletic on the basis of derived features of the third postcleithrum, lower jaw, hyoid arch, pterotic, supracleithrum, and the laterosensory canal systems in the infraorbitals, frontal, and posterior lateral-line scales. Modifications of a subset of those systems, the subopercle, dentition, suspensorium, third postcleithrum, and pigmentation define subunits of Caenotropus or are autapomorphic for its species.Caenotropus is revised, with Tylobronchus Eigenmann (1912) considered a junior synonym. Three Caenotropus species are recognized: C. labyrinthicus (Kner, 1858) widely distributed in the Rio Amazonas and RÃ­o Orinoco basins, the upper Essequibo River basin in Guyana, the Saramacca and Suriname Rivers in Suriname, and the Rio ParnaÃ­ba, northeastern Brazil; C. maculosus (Eigenmann, 1912) ranging from the Essequibo River of Guyana to the Fleuve Maroni of French Guiana; and C. mestomorgmatos, new species, from the acidic black waters of the middle and upper RÃ­o Negro in Brazil and Venezuela and the upper RÃ­o Orinoco in southern Venezuela. Chilodus labyrinthicus rupununi Fowler (1914) is placed into the synonymy of Caenotropus labyrinthicus.Keys are provided to the genera Caenotropus and Chilodus and to the species of Caenotropus. A lectotype is designated for Microdus labyrinthicus Kner. The biogeographic implications of the geographic distribution of subunits of the Chilodontidae are discussed.

N2  - Sigalionid species of polychaetes included in Pelogeniinae Chamberlin, 1919, are reviewed and revised, based on reexamination of type material and published records, as well as examination of new material. The species are characterized by the dorsum and elytra being more or less covered with sand and foreign material tightly held by adhesive papillae. In this revision, the subfamily is represented by eight genera, separated into two groups, based on the presence or absence of dorsal cirri on segment III. The Pelogenia group (with dorsal cirri), includes Pelogenia Schmarda, 1861 (with synonym Eupholoe McIntosh, 1885), Claparedepelogenia (new name for Lepidopleurus ClaparÃ¨de, 1868, preoccupied), and new genera Pottsipelogenia and Heteropelogenia. The Psammolyce group (without dorsal cirri) includes Psammolyce Kinberg, 1856, and new genera Neopsammolyce, Hartmanipsammolyce, and Dayipsammolyce. The report includes remarks on general characteristics of the Pelogeniinae and the study of 30 species, including 21 new combinations, seven new species, and eight synonyms.

N2  - The limacodid group, composed of Limacodidae (+ Chrysopolomidae), Dalceridae, Megalopygidae, Aididae, and Somabrachyidae, is revised, and diagnoses, redescriptions, and keys to larval and adult stages are provided for each family. Comparative morphology and ontogeny of the larval stage are emphasized. Immature stages, including first instars, of a number of taxa are figured for the first time. New character data for adults and immatures are presented, including the presence of larval crochets on abdominal segments A2-A7 and A10 in species of Megalopygidae and Limacodidae. Computer-assisted phylogenetic analyses of limacodid-group families using separate character-data sets from adult and immature stages produces congruent cladograms of equal parsimony, with Zygaenidae selected as the outgroup. Megalopygidae (Megalopyginae + Trosiinae) is found to be the most basal family among the limacodid group, and Aididae, previously a subfamily of Megalopygidae, is the sister group to the Limacodidae + Dalceridae clade. Chrysopolomidae is placed as a subfamily of Limacodidae based on new character evidence from adult and immature stages. Relationships of Somabrachyidae, Epipyropidae, and Cyclotornidae also are discussed. Previous interpretations of character homologies for abdominal prolegs in the larvae are revised based on the phylogenetic analysis, resulting in a novel hypothesis concerning the evolutionary transformation from prolegs to a slug-like ventral surface. New representations of homology for larval body setae and for juxta and valva of male genitalia also are given. Behavioral observations of immatures and adults of species in the limacodid group are presented, along with a review of their biology.

N2  - Species currently allocated to the northwestern North American genus Fluminicola Carpenter, 1864, comprise a morphologically diverse group that is shown to be paraphyletic based on a cladistic analysis of nominal species utilizing European Lithoglyphus Hartmann, 1821, and two eastern North American genera as outgroups. Fluminicola consists of a single, highly divergent species (F. virens) and a clade comprising all other congeners, which is defined by synapomorphic conditions of pedal ganglia and penis. Groups of species within the clade are united by derived modifications of shell protoconch microsculpture, operculum, central and lateral radular teeth, ctenidium, hypobranchial gland, penis, ovary, and female capsule gland.A redefinition of Fluminicola in the wake of the above analysis cannot be provided until anatomical details of the type species (which may be extinct) are obtained. Nine Recent species currently are assigned to this group. These are Fluminicola coloradensis, distributed in the Green River basin; F. dalli, Pyramid Lake basin; F. fuscus, Snake-Columbia River basin; F. minutissimus, Snake River basin; F. modoci, Goose Lake basin; F. nuttallianus, Willamette River basin; F. seminalis, Sacramento and Pit river basins; F. turbiniformis, northwestern Great Basin; and F. virens, Willamette and lower Columbia river basins.Amnicola hindsi Baird, 1863, Fluminicola nuttalliana columbiana Keep, 1887, and Fluminicola columbiana Pilsbry, 1899a, are junior synonyms of F. fuscus (Haldeman, 1841); Lithoglyphus cumingii Frauenfeld, 1863a, is a junior synonym of F. seminalis (Hinds, 1842); and Paludina nuclea Lea, 1838, is a junior synonym of F. virens (Lea, 1838). The genus-group taxon Heathilla Hannibal, 1912, is a synonym of Fluminicola.

T1  - Weevil Diversity and Seasonality in Tropical Panama as Deduced from Light-Trap Catches (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea)
JO  - Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology

N2  - Weevils were collected with light traps at seven localities in the Republic of Panama, varying in altitude from sea level to 2200 m, in climate from sharply seasonal to virtually nonseasonal, and in habitat from natural tropical forest to areas strongly disturbed by humans. Although only an estimated 25-40 percent of the species of weevils present in an area were attracted to light, a total of 2086 species was nonetheless obtained in the traps. On Barro Colorado Island (BCI), the canopy trap caught more individuals but fewer species than the trap near the ground. Species richness (alpha-diversity) varied greatly between sites, BCI being the richest and the high-altitude site of Guadalupe Arriba being the poorest. Using the logseries as an arbitrary but useful basis for comparison, there were too many rare species and too few species of intermediate abundances at all sites. Between-site (beta-) diversity was also large, with one-third to two-thirds of the species at each site being only observed at that site, whereas species occurring at four or more sites were very rare.Descriptors of seasonal patterns are proposed that were borrowed from circular statistics, such as Mean Vector and Mean Week. The former indicates the degree of seasonality, i.e., the concentration of the individuals in a year, which ranges in value from zero (uniform distribution) to unity (all individuals occurring at the same time), whereas the latter indicates the circular mean of the seasonal distribution. These were used in conjunction with other seasonality measures, such as Peak Week, which is the mode of the seasonal distribution. For all six sites with at least one year of data, these measures were calculated for each year for all species with at least 10 individuals in that year. A very rich variation in seasonal patterns was observed among species, ranging from species with very short seasons to species occurring year-round, sometimes without any clear seasonal peaks. At the climatically seasonal sites and at one less seasonal site, most species exhibited their maximum abundance at the beginning of the rainy season. However, at all sites some species were active or even had their mean or maximum abundance at any time of the year. Most species demonstrated very similar seasonal patterns in successive years, apart from shifts of a few weeks related to the actual beginning of the rainy season, but there were some clear exceptions. Similarly, for most species that occurred at more than one site in reasonable numbers the seasonal patterns were rather similar in those different sites in spite of differences in habitat, seasonality, or altitude. However, there were a number of species with spectacular differences in seasonal patterns at different sites. In some cases such differences could partly be attributed to differences between the sites, in others they could not. Species with an intermediate degree of seasonality showed a higher variability between sites than between years within sites.The results were compared with those obtained for weevils from temperate areas. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on between-year and between-site comparisons in seasonality with a large number of tropical insect species.

T1  - A Generic Revision and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Turbinoliidae (Cnidaria: Scleractinia)
JO  - Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology
SN  - 0081-0282

SP  - 1
EP  - 55
UR  - http://www.sil.si.edu/smithsoniancontributions/Zoology/sc_RecordSingle.cfm?filename=SCTZ-0591
N2  - The monophyly of the Turbinoliidae is based on the unique (within the Caryophylliina) character of having its entire corallum invested with tissue, which is reflected in its well-formed costae from base to calice and its characteristically deep intercostal regions. All turbinoliids are solitary and free-living, and thus the complete investiture of its corallum might facilitate movement through or across a sandy substrate.The Turbinoliidae consists of 28 genera and 163 valid species, of which 22 genera and 49 species are extant. The earliest known turbinoliid is from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian) of Antarctica. All 28 genera are diagnosed and figured herein. The stratigraphic and geographic distributions are discussed for each genus, and a list of species known for each genus, including junior synonyms, is given. Two genera and two species are described as new: Pleotrochus, P. zibrowii, Foveolocyathus, and Sphenotrochus wellsi. Peponocyathus is restricted to those species having transverse division, which requires the resurrection of Deltocyathoides Yabe and Eguchi, 1932, for those species that do not reproduce by transverse division, and it also requires the synonymy of Truncatocyathus Stolarski, 1992. Tropidocyathus is divided into two genera, allowing the resurrection of Cyathotrochus Bourne, 1905. Oryzotrochus stephensoni Wells, 1959, is identified as a Turbinolia, which synonymizes Oryzotrochus and extends the stratigraphic range of Turbinolia from the Oligocene to Recent.Phylogenetic analysis of the 28 turbinoliid genera was carried out using 16 characters, comprising 49 character states. Relationships among taxa were determined based on parsimony and successive weighting of characters. Subfamilies of the Caryophylliidae were used as outgroups. Characters that contributed highly to the phylogenetic hypothesis were costal ornamentation, costal origination, and septal number. Characteristics of thecal structure (i.e., imperforate, externally pitted, perforate) were re-examined in all genera. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis (Figure 2) suggests that the turbinoliids are divided into two major clades. One (clade 2) contains 12 genera including all six Late Cretaceous Antarctic genera, as well as genera first recorded from the Eocene of New Zealand and Oligocene of South Australia. Coralla of this clade are characterized by having trifurcate costal origination and serrate costal ornamentation. The other major clade (clade 3) contains 14 genera, including one from the Late Cretaceous of New Zealand, five with first occurrences in the Paleocene to Miocene of Europe and North America, and three from the Eocene to Oligocene of South Australia. These are genera characterized by coralla with less than 48 septa and granular or smooth costae. It is cautioned that the results of this analysis are considered preliminary, as it is based exclusively on skeletal characters. Consequently, clades are not highly supported, nonetheless, this analysis suggests which skeletal characters should be examined more carefully in the future, and it serves as a comparison for future analyses that might include tissue and/or molecular characters. The status of the Early Cretaceous genus Platytrochopsis Sikharulidze, 1975, is also discussed.

N2  - Shore flies (Diptera: Ephydridae) from the Belizean cays are reviewed, including the description of one new genus (Garifuna) and five new species (Discocerina (Discocerina) juniori, Polytrichophora reginae, Guttipsilopa (Nesopsilopa) dianneae, Paralimna (Paralimna) fellerae, and Garifuna sinuata). Although the known shore-fly fauna of these cays is relatively diverse, comprising 56 species in 31 genera, none of the species is thought to be endemic, i.e., the species are introductions from the mainland. The subfamily Gymnomyzinae has greatest species diversity on the cays, especially the tribe Discocerinini, which has 12 species in three genera.

N2  - Pillar Point Harbor, a small harbor formed in 1961 by construction of a breakwater in Half Moon Bay, California, in 1975 contained five species of benthic myodocopid Ostracoda. Analysis of the environment suggests that the distribution of individual species may, in part, have been affected by the substrate. Two new species, Rutiderma apex and Euphilomedes morini, are described and illustrated, and supplementary descriptions are provided for Euphilomedes carcharodonta (Smith, 1952) and Postasterope barnesi (Baker, 1978). The ontogenies of both species of Euphilomedes are described, and it is shown that juveniles of E. morini are capable of swimming, whereas those of E. carcharodonta are not. The abundance of the ostracodes in Pillar Point Harbor was greater than in many other continental bays for which abundances are known. Commensal protistans colonized carapaces of both species of Euphilomedes but not other species in the harbor.

N2  - The genus Chimarra, subgenus Curgia Walker, is revised, resulting in 92 species being recognized, of which 52 are described as new. The subgenus, which is exclusively New World in distribution, is characterized in the adult stage, and its relationships are briefly discussed. A key to the species, based primarily on the male genitalia, is presented. Diagnostic characters and descriptions are given for all species, the male genitalia are figured, and distribution maps are presented. The subgenus is divided into 16 species groups, which are characterized, their distributions are given, and relationships of the contained species are discussed. Of the 52 names available before this work, 40 are still recognized as valid. Six synonymies are proposed herein: C. martinmoselyi Botosaneanu under morio (Burmeister); alayoi Botosaneanu under moesta Banks; punctulata Flint under parana Flint; catarinensis Flint under scopuloides Flint; and brustia Ross and alamosa Denning under laguna Ross. One species, barrettae (Banks), is resurrected from the synonymy of mexicana (Banks).

N2  - This is a vade mecum of terms for describing all aspects of sponge morphology, such as habit, surface structure, consistency, and anatomy. Definitions of microscopic features include aquiferous system, cytology, reproductive structures, skeletal architecture, and calcareous and siliceous spicules. Terms were selected and reviewed by an international group of 10 experts in sponge systematics, during several workshops. Each entry is accompanied by a precise diagnosis and an illustration. Terms listed as "rejected" are those judged unsuitable, redundant, or preoccupied. The thesaurus will aid descriptions in future systematic papers, computerized data banks, and identification keys. The literature cited presents a historical perspective on similar attempts to create a precise terminology of sponge morphology and helps to further clarify the selected terms.

T1  - A World Classification of the Harmacloninae, a New Subfamily of Tineidae (Lepidoptera: Tineoidea)

N2  - The systematics, phylogeny, morphology, and distribution are summarized for the newly proposed subfamily Harmacloninae. Synapomorphies distinguishing this subfamily from the sister group, Myrmecozelinae, include (1) unique wing coupling system consisting of raised scales along the ventral hindmargin of the forewing interlocking into similar scales along the dorsal subcostal area of the hindwing; (2) pretarsus without arolium and pseudempodial seta; (3) the presence of paired abdominal tympanic organs; (4) enlargement of the sternal apophyses on the second abdominal sternum; and (5) aedoeagus with a basal, midventral keel. Cladistic analysis of the 22 species, using the genus Gerontha of the Myrmecozelinae as an outgroup, resulted in the recognition of two monophyletic genera: Micrerethista, with 10 of the 11 recognized species concentrated in the Oriental/Australian regions and a single species from equatorial Africa, and Harmaclona, consisting of 11 pantropical species. The following taxa are described as new: Micrerethista africana, M. bifida, M. denticulata, M. dissacca, M. fasciola, M. fusca, M. nigrapex, M. resima, Harmaclona afrotephrantha, H. hexacantha, H. robinsoni, H. tetracantha, and H. triacantha. Distribution maps and keys are provided for all species. Diagnostic characters of all taxa are fully illustrated by line drawings and photographs.The vicariant distributions of certain Harmacloninae suggest a minimum age of more than 90 m.y. for the subfamily. If tympanic organs in Harmacloninae evolved primarily as a defense against insectivorous, echolocating bats, as has been proposed for other Lepidoptera, then this would indicate that echolocating bats must have appeared earlier than the Harmacloninaeâ€”at least by the beginning of the late Cretaceous.

N2  - Twenty-one species of the family Axinellidae (sensu LÃ©vi) reside in the central West Atlantic region, from the Carolinas to the southern Caribbean. They are distributed in seven genera, and five are new species: Axinella pomponiae, A. meandroides, Pseudaxinella(?) zeai, Dragmaxia undata, and Auletta tuberosa. A taxonomic diagnosis of these genera and species indicates that the nominal genera Teichaxinella de Laubenfels and Homaxinella Topsent previously recorded from the region are invalid and that in the study area their species can be allocated to Axinella. Acanthella and Ptilocaulis, traditionally grouped with the Axinellidae but recently allocated to the families Dictyonellidae and Desmoxyidae of the Order Halichondrida (sensu van Soest et al., 1990), are included in this revision because the scope of the other families has not yet been established. Ptilocaulis, at least, is shown to be closely related to Axinella.

N2  - We provide herein a description of morphological characters of aquatic gastropods of the family Hydrobiidae and of several other families of Rissooidea that resemble these snails in general features. The hydrobiid gastropods comprise the largest group of freshwater mollusks, with more than 1,000 species and more than 400 Recent and fossil genera. This compilation is a prelude to the first rigorous phylogenetic analysis of the higher taxa of this cosmopolitan, yet poorly understood, group, for which at least 70 family-group taxa have been proposed. It also was prepared to fulfill a need for standardization of terminology and interpretation of characters used in taxonomic descriptions of these small, often morphologically simple, snails. Given that taxonomic study of these animals has long been hampered by reliance on a limited number of morphological features, all aspects of the shell and the soft-part anatomy are reviewed as part of this treatment, and we attempt to be maximally inclusive in listing characters. Emphasis is placed on characters considered potentially useful in recognizing and defining hydrobiid clades, although features having utility for species-rank descriptions are summarized in an appendix. For 202 characters, sufficient information was available to delineate states and tentatively identify plesiomorphic conditions (based on outgroup comparisons). Features utilized are from the shell (29 characters), operculum (13), external features (32), pallial cavity (10), digestive system (29), life history (6), female reproductive system (52), and male reproductive system (31). Discussion of many characters is augmented by schematic diagrams and in almost all cases by reference to taxa and published figures illustrating given states. Many characters are extensively annotated, and in some cases new concepts of homology and/or division of characters are proposed.

T1  - Natural History of the Sea Fan Blenny, Emblemariopsis pricei (Teleostei: Chaenopsidae), in the Western Caribbean

N2  - The chaenopsid blenny Emblemariopsis pricei Greenfield presently is known only from waters off Belize and Honduras, where it occurs at depths of 1 to 30 m. It is unusual among Atlantic Ocean fishes in partitioning its microhabitat usage according to sex and age. During daylight, females, nonbreeding males, and immatures are found mostly on the surface of soft-coral sea fans (Gorgonia ventalina Linnaeus), whereas breeding males occupy cavities in live scleractinian corals. The cavities are the remains of serpulid worm (Spirobranchus giganteus (Pallas)) tubes, which are most often found in elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata (Lamarck)), but which also are found in species of several genera of globose mound corals. Breeding males are dark-headed and range from 17.5 to 28.6 mm standard length (SL). Adult females, adult nonbreeding males, and immatures are semitransparent; mature females attain up to 19.6 mm SL and nonbreeding males up to 24.3 mm SL. Approximately one in eight sea fans at a study reef at Carrie Bow Cay, Belize, has a blenny present. Pale adult males, presumably seeking tube cavities to occupy, frequently are found on the surface of live coral, especially in the vicinity of cavities occupied by dark-headed males. Pale males immediately enter any tube cavities that become vacant when resident dark-headed males are removed. Upon occupation, pale males turn dark headed overnight, although the full complement of dark pigment that remains evident in preserved specimens takes up to 10 days to develop. Females deposit their eggs in the tube cavities, where the resident breeding male fertilizes and incubates them. Mature females have 21 to 27 large ovarian eggs, and most tube cavities contain an average of about 300 eggs in various stages of development from multiple spawning deposits.

N2  - A new species of myodocopid Ostracoda, Tetragonodon rex, is described and illustrated, including all growth stages. Based on morphology only, it is concluded that the adult male is capable of swimming, whereas adult females and juveniles are restricted to the sediment. Gut contents were unidentifiable, except for some foraminiferans. The species has five growth stages, and order of appearance of appendages, as well as their progressive morphological development, are similar to those of other Myodocopina in the subfamily Pseudophilomedinae. Methods for the determination of age of growth stages are discussed, and it is concluded that T. rex does not undergo postadult molting. Evidence for postadult molting in other myodocopid species is reviewed, and it is concluded that the question remains tenuously open for Macrocypridina and Gigantocypris. The production of eggs and mortality in the Myodocopina is discussed, and additional data is reported supporting clutch size being in part a function of adult size. In general, for those few species for which all instars are known, the Cypridinidae appear to have six stages, the Sarsiellidae and Rutidermatidae have five stages, the Philomedinae have six stages, and the Pseudophilomedinae have five stages. Within the Cylindroleberididae, the Asteropteroninae have five to seven stages, the Cylindroleberidinae have six stages, and the Cyclasteropinae have seven stages. Analysis of the relative lengths of adult males and females of the Philomedidae indicates that length differences are not affected by whether or not the adult female is capable of swimming.

N2  - The myrmecophyte Humboldtia laurifolia is endemic to Sri Lanka, where it is a common understory tree in lowland rainforests. It attracts a diversity of invertebrate associates and possesses morphology and phenology, including expanded, hollow, self-opening internodes and a variety of extrafloral nectaries that facilitate a relationship with ants.Fourteen ant taxa were collected on H. laurifolia. Technomyrmex albipes (F. Smith) was dominant at many sites. Other ant taxa included Tetraponera sp., Cataulacus taprobanae F. Smith, three species of Crematogaster, Pheidole sp., Tetramorium pacificum Mayr, Dolichoderus sp., Tapinoma sp., Anoplolepis gracilipes (F. Smith), Camponotus sp., Oecophylla smaragdina (Fabricius), and Polyrhachis bugnioni Forel.Among other invertebrates found on H. laurifolia was the internode-nesting crabronine wasp Krombeinictus nordenae Leclercq. It is unique among Sphecidae in its attentive maternal care, progressive feeding of pollen to a single larva at a time, and cocoon placement and structure.Also commonly found nesting in Humboldtia was the crabronine Crossocerus mukalanae Leclercq. It makes a typical crabronine nest, constructing a linear series of cells from fragments of the dried, collapsed plant pith within the internode. The paralyzed prey provided for the larvae were predominantly Diptera, the majority of them nematocerous species; other less common prey included chalcidoid wasps and Ephemeroptera. Several species of Perilampus (Chalcidoidea) are pupal parasites of C. mukalanae, and larvae and adults of species of Staphylinidae found in wasp nests are presumed to be brood predators.A much less common hymenopteran nesting in internodes was an undescribed species of the social xylocopine bee Braunsapis. Four nests contained one or two females, an occasional male, and immature brood. A larva of a species of Cleridae, presumably a brood predator, was found in two of the nests.Several invertebrate associates of Humboldtia are clearly ant predators. The fly larva of Platyceridion edax Chandler and Matile (Keroplatidae) is primarily predaceous on worker ants. Also recorded were the larvae of Microdon sp. (Syrphidae), which feed on ant brood, and the pseudoscorpion Haplochernes warburgi (Tullgren), which is predatory on worker ants. The relationship of other associates was less clear. These included spiders (Theridiidae, Hadrotarsinae), the bee Nomada wickwari Meade-waldo (Anthophoridae), the wasps Carinostigmus costatus Krombein (Sphecidae) and Physetopoda fumigata (Turner) (Mutillidae), and numerous specimens of Pscoptera and Collembola.Also, clusters of an arboreal annelid, Perionyx sp. (Megascolecidae), were found in some internodes, and individuals were noted crawling on stems or leaves during light rains. Adults were observed mating on foliage and were never found on the ground.The diapausing larva of Krombeinictus nordenae is described in an appendix by Howard E. Evans. It is not significantly different from other crabronine larvae of the genera Crossocerus, Crabro, and Rhopalum, even though the larvae were fed pollen rather than paralyzed arthropods.

N2  - A new genus and two new species of marine Ostracoda (Myodocopina: Cypridinidae), collected mostly from baited traps in the waters of the Bahamas and the Caribbean Sea, are described and illustrated. Jimmorinia gunnari, the type species, is nonluminescent and was captured at 88-99 m depth on a submarine escarpment in Exuma Sound near Lee Stocking Island and Great Exuma Island, Exuma Cays, Great Bahama Bank, Bahamas, and from shallower depths (3-15 m) off Discovery Bay, Jamaica, Roatan Island, Honduras, and the San Blas Islands, Panama, whereas J. gamma was collected only near Lee Stocking Island. Descriptions for adult females are given for both species, and descriptions of adult males and some juvenile stages are given for J. gunnari. Some sexual and geographic variation is described. A table of generic comparisons is presented. Some specimens of the new genus were tested and were found to be nonluminescent. Jimmorinia has an upper lip with fewer glandular processes (nozzles) than are present on the lips of Caribbean bioluminescent species. This paucity of nozzles may be related to a lack of bioluminescent capacity. The reduced number of ommatidia, very unusual in a cypridinid from shallow depths, may be related to the lack of luminosity, or perhaps it indicates an ancestral relationship to cypridinids from greater depths or from an anchialine cave.

N2  - Of those lanternfishes in the genus Lampanyctus (sensu lato) with short or no pectoral fins, 17 species are recognized, removed to the separate genus Nannobrachium, and placed into five species groups. These groups are designated Nigrum (four species), Regale (five species), Cuprarium (two species), Achirus (five species), and Isaacsi (one species).The genus Nannobrachium includes those species of the tribe Lampanyctini that are characterized by the following features: either a lack of pectoral fins or short fins with a narrow base in adults; vertically elongate, squarish otoliths with smooth margins; reduced musculature resulting in a soft, flaccid body; body profile appearing "pinched" with concave dorsal and ventral profiles behind the head; and swimbladder atrophied in adults.The four species in the Nigrum group are N. nigrum, from the tropical and subtropical Pacific and eastern Indian oceans; N. atrum, from the temperate North and South Atlantic, South Indian, and Southwest Pacific oceans; N. gibbsi, herein described from the tropical Pacific; and N. indicum, herein described from the tropical Indian Ocean. All have extremely reduced pectoral fins with downward pointing fin rays in the adult.All five species in the Regale group are confined to the Pacific Ocean: N. regale in the Subarctic and North Temperate; N. ritteri in the eastern North Pacific Subarctic and Temperate; N. fernae in the eastern North Pacific Temperate; N. idostigma in the eastern tropical Pacific; and N. bristori herein described from the North Subtropical Pacific. In the Regale group, the pectoral fin is not as reduced compared with other Nannobrachium groups, and the VLO photophore is low on the side of the body.The two species in the Cuprarium group are N. cuprarium, bipolar in the subtropical Atlantic, and N. lineatum, from the tropical-subtropical Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. Both species have black pigmentation on the posterior of the supracaudal and infracaudal luminous glands.Four of the five species in the Achirus group are herein described: N. hawaiiensis, N. crypticum, and N. phyllisae from the North Central, Equatorial, and Southeast Pacific, respectively; and N. wisneri, circumglobal from the southern temperate and subtropical regions. The previously described N. achirus is circumglobal in the Subantarctic. In all five species, the pectoral fin becomes greatly reduced or is completely lost and covered over by skin in adults.The Isaacsi group contains only N. isaacsi from the eastern tropical Atlantic. It has the VO2 photophore raised in position, above and slightly forward of the VO1.Most of the species and species groups show remarkably little overlap in their distributions. Analysis of the distribution patterns revealed distinct patterns concordant, or largely so, with patterns recognized for other oceanic organisms.

N2  - The rufoaenea and quararibea groups (section Rufoaenea); the famula, formicaria, and phaenicodera groups (section Erythropus); and the capitata, cyanea, dimidiata, neblina, novaurora, and poguei groups constituted the study group for this paper because they share cribriform elytral interneurs, an easily recognizable attribute for selecting specimens for study. They are referred to as the "Novaurora complex." The pusilla group, which shares interneur structural features with the Novaurora complex but little else, also was included in the key to groups. All of the above are treated in the key and are tersely described at the group level. The following groups are herein revised.The novaurora group is a northern Amazon-Orinoco lineage comprising five species with a composite range extending from Ecuador to French Guiana and south into Brazil. Four specific taxa of the novaurora group are described as new (type locality in parentheses): alinahui (Ecuador: Napo Province, 20 km E Puerto Napo, Alinahui, 01Â°00'S, 077Â°25'W), orinocensis (Venezuela: CaÃ±o Marcareo, Orinoco Delta), novaurora (Ecuador: Napo province, 20 km E Puerto Napo, Alinahui, 01Â°00'S, 077Â°25'W), superba (Venezuela: T.F. Amazonas, confluence of Rio Negro and Rio Baria, 00Â°55'N, 066Â°10'W).The dimidiata group, predominantly northern Neotropical, comprises 16 species with a composite range extending from Mexico to northern Peru, and east to easternmost Venezuela. Thirteen specific taxa of the dimidiata group are described as new: bci (Panama: Barro Colorado Id., 09Â°10'N, 079Â°50'W), duckworthorum (Panama: Barro Colorado Id., 09Â°10'N, 079Â°50'W), eponine (Costa Rica: Puntarenas, Quepos, Parque Nacional Manuel Antonio, 09Â°24'N, 084Â°09'W), falcon (Venezuela: FalcÃ³n, Sanare, Finca Tillerias, 09Â°39'N, 069Â°45'W), hespenheide (Costa Rica: Heredia, La Selva, 10Â°26'N, 084Â°01'W), hovorei (Mexico: Vera Cruz, Estacion Biologica Los Tuxtlas, 18Â°27'S, 095Â°13'W), inbio (Costa Rica: Puntarenas, Mata de LimÃ³n, 09Â°55'54''N, 084Â°42'42''W), maracay (Venezuela: Maracay, 10Â°15'N, 067Â°36'W), paratax (Costa Rica: Puntarenas, Estacion Biologica Carara, E Quebrada Bonita, 09Â°46'25''N, 084Â°36'24''W), pichincha (Ecuador: Pichincha, Santo Domingo, Tinalandia, 00Â°18'S, 079Â°04'W), samiria (Peru: Loreto, Cocha Shinguito, 05Â°08'S, 074Â°45'W), tuxtlas (Mexico: Veracruz, Estacion Biologica Los Tuxtlas, near 18Â°27'S, 095Â°13'W), zapotal (Guatemala: Alta Verapaz, San Cristobal Verapaz, Quixal, 15Â°23'N, 090Â°24'W).The quararibea group is a southern and western Amazon-Pantanal lineage comprising five species with a composite range extending from the upper Xingu drainage of Brazil west into Peru and Ecuador. Four specific taxa of the quararibea group are described as new: magnifica (Peru: Madre de Dios, "Avispas" (Avispal), 12Â°59'S, 071Â°34'W), othello (Ecuador: Napo, 20 km E Puerto Napo, Alinahui, 01Â°04'S, 077Â°25'W), smurf (Brazil: Amazonas, Taperinha, Santarem, 02Â°32'S, 054Â°17'W), suprema (Brazil: Mato Grosso, Rosario Oeste, 14Â°50'S, 056Â°25'W).Distributions are dot-mapped and are discussed in general for each of the species in these three groups. Geographical ranges are given for all the groups of the Novaurora complex herein discussed.

N2  - This paper provides the first numerical cladistic analysis of erigonine phylogenetic relationships based on a sample of taxa. A total of 73 characters, most of them morphological, have been scored for 31 erigonine genera plus 12 outgroup taxa. The parsimony analysis of these data supports the monophyly of Erigoninae based on two synapomorphies: the male pedipalpal tibial apophysis and the loss of the female pedipalpal claw. The monophyly of Linyphiidae and of Linyphiidae plus Pimoidae also is supported. One of the largest clades within the erigonines is the "Distal Erigonines clade," whose monophyly is supported by the loss of the taenidia in the tracheoles and the loss of the distal dorsal spine of tibia IV. The clade composed of Stemonyphantinae plus Mynogleninae is the sister group of Erigoninae. A number of relatively "basal" erigonine lineages, which have been classically regarded as "taxonomically problematic" or "transitional," retain some plesiomorphic characters typical of other subfamilies, like the haplotracheate system or the taenidia in the tracheoles. The available data suggest that the cephalothoracic sulci and glands found in mynoglenines and erigonines are not homologous.

N2  - The bee genus Sphecodogastra Ashmeadis revised from the study of approximately 3200 specimens. Eight species are recognized withthree described as new. All species are described and diagnosed. The systematic history of thegenus, including questions concerning its monophyly, is presented. Flight records are summarizedwith histogram plots, distributions are indicated by dot maps, and illustrated keys are providedfor species identification. Floral association data and daily flight activity records aresummarized, and a literature review of nesting biology is presented for four species (S. antiochensis,S. lusoria, S. oenotherae, S. texana). The new species are S. antiochensis (a potentiallyendangered species), S. danforthi, and S. potosi. Sphecodogastra lusoria (Cresson) is elevatedfrom junior synonymy under S. aberrans (Crawford), and Halictus galpinisae Cockerell is synonymizedunder S. lusoria. New combinations are S. aberrans (Crawford), S. lusoria(Cresson), and S. oenotherae (Stevens).

N2  - This is the second of a planned series providing aids (keys and dorsal habitus drawings of the type species of each genus) for identifying the world's genera of Tingidae and in some cases their included species; it treats two tribes of the subfamily Tinginae: Litadeini Drake and Ruhoff and Ypsotingini Drake and Ruhoff (with tables of distribution of the genera).For the tribe Litadeini, 14 genera are keyed. To the single genus, Litadea China, cataloged in this tribe by Drake and Ruhoff (1965a), subsequent literature added 10 genera and herein Cephalidiosus Guilbert, Cottothucha Drake and Poor, and Palauella Drake are transferred into the tribe. Keys are given to species of four genera: two in Aristobyrsa, two in Cephalidiosus, two in Psilobyrsa, and five in Stragulotingis; all other genera of Litadeini contain a single species.For the tribe Ypsotingini, seven genera and two subgenera are keyed. In this paper Euaulana austrina Drake is made a junior synonym of Chorotingis indigena Drake, and Ypsotingis chlaina Drake and Ruhoff is transferred to the genus Engyotingis, in the tribe Tingini, and forms the new combination Engyotingis chlaina (Drake). Keys to species are given for three genera: two species in Dictyotingis, two in Euaulana Drake, and five in Ypsotingis Drake. Of the other four genera, Chorotingis has one species, Derephysia has 16 species, Dictyonota has 28 species, and Kalama has 28 species. Keys for the latter three genera were not included because of lack of specimens at hand.

N2  - Morphological variation among members of the genus Tryonia (and its subgenus Paupertryonia) is congruent with a recently published phylogenetic analysis based on mtDNA sequences that showed that these taxa are polyphyletic assemblages of ecologically similar snails. Tryonia is reconstituted as a North and Central American monophyletic subunit of the subfamily Cochliopinae based on a synapomorphy of posterodorsal insertion of the vas deferens into the prostate gland. Presumably derived modifications of the shell, radular teeth, and genitalia unite groups of species within this genus.Tryonia is redefined and 18 species are recognized in the genus. Congeners are T. aequicostata (Pilsbry, 1890a), distributed in the Florida peninsula; T. cheatumi (Pilsbry, 1935) and T. circumstriata (Leonard and Ho, 1960), Rio Grande basin; T. hertleini (Drake, 1956), interior drainage of northeast Mexico; T. clathrata Stimpson, 1865, and T. gilae Taylor, 1987, lower Colorado River basin; T. angulata Hershler and Sada, 1987, T. elata Hershler and Sada, 1987, T. ericae Hershler and Sada, 1987, T. margae Hershler, 1989, T. monitorae Hershler, 1999, T. rowlandsi Hershler, 1989, T. salina Hershler, 1989, and T. variegata Hershler and Sada, 1987, southern Great Basin; T. porrecta (Mighels, 1845), lower Colorado River basin, Great Basin, Hawaii; T. quitobaquitae Hershler in Hershler and Landye, 1988, Rio Sonoyta basin; T. imitator (Pilsbry, 1899), southern California coast; and T. exigua (Morelet, 1851), Lake PetÃ©n Itza, Guatemala. Tryonia protea (Gould, 1855) is found to be a junior synonym of Paludina porrecta Mighels, 1845.Tryonia kosteri Taylor, 1987, from the Pecos River basin, is found to be a member of the genus Durangonella Morrison, 1945, which was previously known only from the Mexican Plateau. A new North American genus, Pseudotryonia Hershler, is erected for three species previously placed in Tryonia. Pseudotryonia is diagnosed by a combination of genitalic characters. Its congeners are P. brevissima (Pilsbry, 1890b), Florida panhandle; P. adamantina Taylor, 1987, and P. alamosae Taylor, 1987, Rio Grande basin; and an undescribed species from the Tombigbee River basin. A new monotypic genus, Ipnobius Hershler, is erected for Tryonia robusta Hershler, 1989, from Death Valley, California. Ipnobius is diagnosed by genitalic autapomorphies. Lectotypes are designated for Melania exigua Morelet, and Amnicola protea Gould.

N2  - Creagrutus GÃ¼nther (1864) and Piabina Reinhardt (1867) are diagnosed as a monophyletic assemblage on the basis of synapomorphies in various osteological and soft anatomical systems. Synapomorphies in a subset of these systems diagnose each genus and partially resolve the intrageneric phylogeny within Creagrutus. Piabina was found to be nonmonophyletic as previously constituted and is restricted herein to its type species, P. argentea Reinhardt (1867). Creagrudite Myers (1927) and Creagrutops Schultz (1944) share the characters diagnostic for Creagrutus and are considered junior synonyms of that genus in order to make Creagrutus monophyletic. Piabarchus Myers (1928), based on a species originally described in Piabina, was found to lack the derived features of the Creagrutus-Piabina lineage.A total of 64 species are recognized in Creagrutus (including 37 new species), 56 of which occur east of the Andean Cordilleras and are reviewed in this paper. The number of Creagrutus species herein recognized represents 337% of the number of species considered valid prior to Harold and Vari (1994).Contrary to recent taxonomic practice, Piabina is recognized as distinct but is limited to a single species, P. argentea Reinhardt (1867), distributed in various rivers of eastern Brazil.Keys are provided to the species of Creagrutus and Piabina in the major drainage basins within the range of the genera.Creagrutus nasutus GÃ¼nther (1876) is considered a synonym of C. peruanus, and Creagrutus boehlkei GÃ©ry (1972) is placed into the synonymy of C. amoenus. Creagrutus pellegrini Puyo (1943) is assigned to the characid genus Chalceus.Lectotypes are designated for Piabina argentea Reinhardt, Leporinus muelleri GÃ¼nther, Creagrutus nasutus GÃ¼nther, C. pearsoni Mahnert and GÃ©ry, Piabina peruana Steindachner, and C. phasma Myers.

N2  - Eleven leaf-mining species of Phyllonorycter are recognized as being restricted to the host plant genera Populus and Salix in North America, including Mexico. Previously described species and their new synonyms include the following: P. apicinigrella (Braun); P. apparella (Herrick-SchÃ¤ffer.) (=P. atomariella (Zeller), P. tremuloidiella (Braun), P. ontario (Freeman)); P. nipigon (Freeman); P. populiella (Chambers); P. salicifoliella (Chambers) (=P. kenora (Freeman)); and P. scudderella (Frey and Boll) (=P. salicivorella (Braun)). The following new species are proposed in this study: P. acanthus, P. deserticola, P. erugatus, P. latus, and P. mildredae. Only P. acanthus and P. deserticola are known to occur in Mexico. Three species groups are recognized primarily on the basis of their similar morphology and, to a lesser extent, on their host preference: the apparella group (including P. apparella, P. deserticola, P. latus, and P. nipigon), which are almost entirely restricted to Populus; the salicifoliella group (including P. acanthus, P. erugatus, P. mildredae, and P. salicifoliella), which feed mostly on Salix and secondarily on Populus; and the hilarella group (including P. apicinigrella, P. populiella, and P. scudderella), which feed primarily on Salix but with one species restricted to Populus. The known life stages of each species are fully illustrated and described, and their distributions are plotted on maps. A synoptic catalog of the 24 Old World species of Phyllonorycter reported from Salicaceae is also provided, wherein P. eophanes (Meyrick) is synonymized under P. iteina (Meyrick). Tentative association of the Palearctic species, based on male genital morphology, with the three proposed species groups is summarized in Table 1.

T1  - A Generic Revision and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Dendrophylliidae (Cnidaria: Scleractinia)

N2  - The Dendrophylliidae comprises 29 genera and 364 valid species, of which 20 genera and 166 species are extant. The earliest known dendrophylliid is from the Early Cretaceous (Barremian) of Serbia, but they are common throughout the fossil record since the Cretaceous and today are worldwide in distribution (except off continental Antarctica) at depths of 0-2165 m. All 29 genera are diagnosed and discussed herein, and representatives (usually the type species) of 27 of the 29 genera are also figured. For each genus, the stratigraphic range and geographic distributions are discussed, and a list of valid species is given, including junior synonyms. Bathymetric ranges are given for all Holocene species and genera. One genus is described as new: Pourtalopsammia. Seven genera previously considered to be in the family are removed from the Dendrophylliidae: Petrophyllia Conrad, 1855 (an oculinid); Turbinacis Gregory, 1900 (a Stylophora; Rhabdopsammia Alloiteau, 1952 (an eusmiliid?); Kumbiopsammia Alloiteau, 1958 (an anthemiphylliid?); Spongiopsammia Kuzmicheva, 1987 (a sponge); Patelopsammia Reig Oriol, 1988 (a fungiid?); and Ilerdopsammia Reig Oriol, 1992 (a caryophylliid). Four other genera, also considered to be dendrophylliids, are herein considered to be of uncertain taxonomic position and are discussed but are not included in the phylogenetic analysis of the dendrophylliid genera: Stereopsammia Milne Edwards and Haime, 1850; Desmopsammia Reis, 1889; Aplopsammia Alloiteau, 1958; and Makridinophyllia Kuzmicheva, 1987. Ceratopsammia Alloiteau, 1958, is newly synonymized with Balanophyllia (Eupsammia). Finally, five new names are proposed for junior homonyms within the genus Balanophyllia.Phylogenetic analysis of the 29 dendrophylliid genera was done using 10 characters, comprising 41 character states. The monophyly of the Dendrophylliidae is based on its possession of a synapticulotheca in conjunction with having septa composed of only one fan system; preliminary molecular analysis also supports its monophyly. Relationships among taxa were determined based on parsimony (PAUP* ver. 4.0) and successive weighting of characters. The early Jurassic caryophylliid genus Discocyathus was used as the outgroup for the analysis. Twenty-seven equally parsimonious trees of 64 steps resulted from the phylogenetic analysis, each having a tree consistency index of 0.531. Characters that contributed highly to the phylogenetic hypothesis were corallum shape, colony form, budding type, and columella type. The cladograms do not support the interpretation of two subfamilies within the Dendrophylliidae; however, all colonial genera do form a clade. In general, the consensus tree is poorly supported, leading to the conclusion that, because of the paucity of characters available from a data set consisting of both fossil and Recent taxa, phylogenetic analysis of supraspecific coral taxa based solely on corallum morphology will usually produce inconclusive and/or poorly supported results.

N2  - Three troglobitic myodocopid ostracodes (two previously described and one new) in the Order Halocyprida are reported from anchialine waters in inland blue holes on Grand Bahama Island and Andros Island. The adult male and female Deeveya bransoni Kornicker and Palmer, 1987, is described and illustrated, a key is presented to species of Deeveya, and the sexual dimorphism and ontogeny of the genus is discussed.Ten species of myodocopid ostracodes (seven previously described and three new) in the Order Myodocopida are reported from eight oceanic blue holes in the vicinity of Exuma Cays and Andros Island. The sarsiellid genus Junctichela Kornicker and Caraion, 1978, is reported from the Bahamas for the first time, and the new species J. pax is interpreted to be endemic to Crab Cay Cravasse, Exuma Cays. Descriptions of some myodocopids include brief notes on gut contents (including nematode, amphipod, worm).No anchialine halocyprid ostracodes have been collected in oceanic blue holes, nor have they been reported from shallow open waters of the Bahamas, from which 28 species of Myodocopida have been reported. Nine species of Myodocopida, which previously had been reported either from the shallow open water of the Bahamas, or the Atlantic shelf of North America, were collected also in the oceanic blue holes. The Simpson Index of faunal resemblance between species of Myodocopida occupying the open ocean and oceanic blue holes is 67, which suggests a close relationship.

N2  - The shore-fly tribe Dryxini is revised, including a cladistic analysis at the generic level, and now includes eight genera. Two of the genera, Omyxa and Papuama, are new, as are their respective type species. Of the remaining six genera, the species are revised for Dryxo Robineau-Desvoidy, Corythophora Loew, Oedenops Becker, and the subgenus Phaiosterna Cresson of the genus Paralimna Loew. In addition, the species of Afrolimna Cogan, Oedenopiforma Cogan, and the limbata group (Paralimna) are reviewed. This study revealed the following synonyms: two genus-group names: Karema Cresson (1929) = Corythophora Loew (1862), and Cyphops Jaennicke (1867) = Dryxo Robineau-Desvoidy (1830); and seven species-group names: Karema loewella Cresson (1929) = Corythophora longipes Loew (1862), Cyphops fasciatus Jaennicke (1867) and Dryxo spreta Osten Sacken (1882) = Dryxo lispoidea Robineau-Desvoidy (1830), Paralimna ligabuei Canzoneri (1987) = Paralimna madecassa Giordani Soika (1956), Oedenops aurantiacus Giordani Soika (1956) and Oedenops flavitarsis Miyagi (1977) = Oedenops isis Becker (1903), and Paralimna (Phaiosterna) vidua Giordani Soika (1956a) = Ephydra bicolor Macquart (1851). Six new species are described in four genera (type locality in parentheses): Dryxo brahma (Sri Lanka. Colombo: Negombo), D. freidbergi (Cameroon. Kribi (beach), Rt. N7), D. india (India. Nedungadu), Omyxa scuta (Iran. 40 km SE Minab), Paralimna (Phaiosterna) longiseta (Dominican Republic. Azua: near Pueblo Viejo (18Â°24.8'N, 70Â°44.7'W)), and Papuama ismayi (Papua New Guinea. Central Province: Daramouka Village).The cladistic analysis was based on 45 morphological characters and resulted in nine most parsimonious cladograms of 55 steps with consistency and retention indices of 0.83 and 0.83, respectively. The tribe is divided into four basal sublineages in the strict consensus cladogram. The first sublineage comprises a single genus (number of species indicated in parentheses), Afrolimna (2), which is Afrotropical in distribution. The second sublineage likewise includes a single genus, Paralimna (>85), including Phaiosterna as a subgenus. Paralimna currently has greater species diversity than the rest of the tribe combined; it is pantropical, with numerous species ranging into subtropical regions. The third sublineage comprises three genera: Dryxo (9), Corythophora (2), and Omyxa (1), with Corythophora as the sister group to Dryxo and Omyxa. Genera of this sublineage occur only in the Old World, with greatest species diversity in Africa. The three genera of the fourth sublineage are Papuama (2), Oedenops (3), and Oedenopiforma (3). In this sublineage, Papuama is the sister group to Oedenops and Oedenopiforma. Oedenops is also pantropical and subtropical in distribution, but Papuama occurs in the Australasian/Oceanian and Oriental regions, and Oedenopiforma occurs in the Old World, primarily Africa and Australia.

N2  - This cladistic study, using 103 putatively informative characters (mostly osteological)of representatives of all of the genera of zeiforms, a primitive tetraodontiform, bothgenera of caproids, and numerous outgroups, strongly supports the monophyly of zeiforms.The possible relationship of zeiforms with tetraodontiforms and caproids is ambiguous; it issupported in three of the four analyses (data ordered with and without most meristic featuresand data unordered with most meristic features) but not in the one that we consider the mostrational and best justified (data unordered without most meristic features).Within zeiforms, there is strong support for a phylogeny that requires a substantially differentarrangement of genera within a new concept of six monophyletic families (three with subfamilies)in two suborders.The genus Cyttus (Cyttoidei, Cyttidae) is shown to be the sister group to all other zeiforms(Zeioidei). The study indicates that the zeiform families, as recognized herein, have the followingphylogenetic sequence: Cyttidae (Cyttus)â€”Oreosomatidae (Pseudocyttinae, Pseudocyttus;Oreosomatinae, Allocyttus, reosoma, Neocyttus)â€”Parazenidae (Parazeninae, Parazen; Cyttopsinae,Cyttopsis, Stethopristes)â€”Zeniontidae (Zenion, Capromimus, Cyttomimus)Ã¢Â€Â”Grammicolepididae (Macrurocyttinae, Macrurocyttus; Grammicolepidinae, Xenolepidichthys,Grammicolepis)â€”Zeidae (Zeus, Zenopsis).The newly composed families and subfamilies are systematically defined, and keys to themare provided.Examples of nearly all of the features used in the phylogenetic analyses and systematicaccounts are illustrated.

The cladistic analysis of genera within Pelomyiinaewas based upon 19 morphological characters and resulted in a single most-parsimonious cladogramof 11 steps with consistency and retention indices of 1.0 and 1.0, respectively. The fourgenera composing the subfamily Pelomyiinae are divided into two lineages in the cladogram:Masoniella plus Pelomyia as the sister group to Neopelomyia plus Pelomyiella.Keys at various taxonomic levels are provided as follows: the genera of Pelomyiinae, thespecies groups of Pelomyia, the species of the coronata group (separate keys to males andfemales), the species of the melanocera group (combined key to males and females), and thespecies of Masoniella (combined key to males and females).

N2  - The systematics, morphology, distribution, and generic phylogeny are summarized for the family.A single autapomorphy, the terminal position of the female ostium at the caudal end of theprolonged and partially separated eighth sternum, distinguishes Arrhenophanidae from its sisterfamily Psychidae. The latter family is further characterized by at least two larval autapomorphies:the presence of four pairs of ventral epipharyngeal setae on the labrum and thecomplete fusion of the prothoracic lateral pinaculum bearing the spiracle with the pronotum.Cladistic analysis, based largely on antennal and venational characters, of the five recognizedgenera positions the southeast Asian genus Palaeophanes basally within the family, followedby the Australian genus Notiophanes. The widespread Neotropical genera Arrhenophanes andDysoptus were found to be the most derived. Larvae of four species, Arrhenophanes perspicilla(Stoll), Cnissostages oleagina Zeller, Dysoptus argus, new species, and Dysoptus prolatus,new species, have been reared. In all known species the larvae construct tough, silken casesand feed on wood decay fungi (Coriolaceae, Hymenochaetaceae, and Polyporaceae).The family occurs in wet tropical forests of southeast Asia (Palaeophanes, four species),Australia (Notiophanes fuscata), and through much of the Neotropical Region (except the WestIndies; Arrhenophanes, Cnissostages, Dysoptus, 21 species). Two genera, Notiophanes Davisand Edwards and Palaeophanes Davis, and the following 18 species are described as new:Cnissostages osae Davis, Dysoptus acuminatus Davis, D. argus Davis, D. asymmetrus Davis,D. avittus Davis, D. bilobus Davis, D. denticulatus Davis, D. fasciatus Davis, D. pentalobusDavis, D. prolatus Davis, D. pseudargus Davis, D. sparsimaculatus Davis, D. spilacrisDavis, Notiophanes fuscata Davis and Edwards, Palaeophanes brevispina Davis, P. lativalvaDavis, P. taiwanensis Davis, and P. xoutha Davis.

N2  - Extensive collectingefforts involving rotenone sampling throughout the Caribbean Sea during the last four decadeshave vastly increased the numbers of specimens of cryptic fishes in museum collections.Among such collections containing clingfishes of the genus Tomicodon Brisout de Barnevilletaken by ourselves and others, we have discovered numerous Caribbean species of Tomicodonin addition to those recognized by W.F. Smith-Vaniz in 1968 (T.fasciatus (Peters, 1859) and T.rhabdotus Smith-Vaniz, 1968). We recognize herein eight more species: three for which namesare availableâ€”T. rupestris (Poey, 1860), T. australis Briggs, 1955, and T. reitzae Briggs, 2001(the last erroneously described as a species from the eastern Pacific Ocean); and five speciesdescribed as new hereinâ€”T. briggsi, T. clarkei, T. cryptus, T. lavettsmithi, and T. leurodiscus.

N2  - The investigation of the inter- and intrafamilial relationships of the Prochilodontidaewas investigated based on information from osteological and soft anatomical systems. Synapomorphiesuncovered during this study provide additional evidence that (1) the clade formed bythe Prochilodontidae plus Curimatidae is the sister group to the clade that consists of the Anostomidaeplus Chilodontidae, (2) supports the hypothesis of the monophyly of the Prochilodontidae,Ichthyoelephas Posada Arango (1909), Prochilodus Agassiz (in Spix and Agassiz, 1829),and Semaprochilodus Fowler (1941), (3) demonstrates that Prochilodus is the sister group tothe clade formed by Ichthyoelephas plus Semaprochilodus, and (4) partially resolves interspecificrelationships.Recognized genera of the Prochilodontidae are Ichthyoelephas, Prochilodus, and Semaprochilodus.Pacu Agassiz (in Spix and Agassiz, 1829) and Chilomyzon Fowler (1906) are synonymsof Prochilodus.Ichthyoelephas includes two species: I. humeralis (Giinther, 1859); and I. longirostris (Steindachner,1879). Ichthyoelephas patalo Posada Arango (1909) and I. longirostris neglectus Dahl(1971) are synonyms of I. longirostris.Prochilodus consists of thirteen species: P. argenteus Agassiz (in Spix and Agassiz, 1829); P.brevis Steindachner (1874); P. britskii Castro (1993); P. costatus Valenciennes (in Cuvier andValenciennes, 1850); P. hartii Steindachner (1874); P. lacustris Steindachner (1907); P. lineatus(Valenciennes, 1836); P. magdalenae Steindachner (1879); P. mariae Eigenmann (1922); P.nigricans Agassiz (in Spix and Agassiz, 1829); P. reticulatus Valenciennes (1850); P. rubrotaeniatusJardine (1841); and P. yimboides Kner (1859).Semaprochilodus contains six species: S. brama (Valenciennes, in Cuvier and Valenciennes,1850); S. insignis (Jardine, 1841); S. kneri (Pellegrin, 1909); S. laticeps (Steindachner, 1879);S. taeniurus (Valenciennes, in Humboldt and Bonpland, 1817); and S. varii Castro (1988).Semaprochilodus squamilentus Fowler (1941) is a synonym of S. brama. Prochilodus theraponuraFowler (1906) and P. amazonensis Fowler (1906) are synonyms of Semaprochilodusinsignis.Keys are provided to the genera and species of prochilodontids. Neotypes are designated forProchilodus argenteus and P. nigricans. Lectotypes are designated for Prochilodus affinis, P.asper, P. brevis, P. cearensis, P. hartii, P. humeralis, P. kneri, P. lacustris, P. longirostris, P.asper var. magdalenae, P. oligolepis, P. reticulatus, P. scrofa, and P. vimboides.The phylogenetic biogeography of the Prochilodontidae indicates that the family dates backminimally to approximately 12 million years ago, with higher level intrafamilial cladogenicevents also dating to at least that time period; these dates are congruent with data from the fossilrecord for more encompassing groups within the Characiformes. Major shifts of overallbauplan characterize the Prochilodontidae and the major clades within the family, but there isrelatively little interspecific diversity. The Prochilodus bauplan has apparently been static forat least 12 million years.

Portland: Crystal Springs (18Â°12.5'N, 76Â°37.9'W)), N. cinnamea (GrandBahamas Island. Freeport), N. duaguttata (Costa Rica. Puntarenas: Rincon (5 km S; 8Â°42.1'N,83Â°30.8'W; 95 m)), N. footei (Panama. Canal Zone: Balboa), N. franciscana (Jamaica.

Chimborazo:Naranjapata Chilicay), N. melina (Panama. Canal Zone: Kobbe Beach), N. negruzca(Grenada. St. John: Concord Falls (12Â°07.1'N, 61Â°43'W)), N. simuliflavida (Dominica. CabritSwamp), N. spinosa (Bermuda. Paget Parish: Botanical Gardens), N. stellata (Ecuador. Orellana:Rio Tiputini (0Â°38.2'S, 76Â°8.9'W)), N. tresguttata (Ecuador. Napo: Baeza (17 km S; 1815m)), N. velutina (Mexico. Chiapas: San Cristobal de Las Casas (2160 m)), N. williamsi (CostaRica. Alajuela: San Mateo, Higuito), N. xenohypopia (Dominican Republic. Pedernales: Sierrade Baoruco, Las Abejas (1300 m)), N. xenoptera (Costa Rica. Puntarenas: Rinc6n (3 km SW,9Â°55'N, 84Â°13'W, 10 m)), N. ypsilona (Costa Rica. Puntarenas: Rincon (3 km SW, 9Â°55'N,84Â°13'W, 10 m)). This study revealed the species-group Nostima niveofasciata Cresson (1947)is synonymous with Nostima canens Cresson (1941).The cladistic analysis was based upon 10 morphological characters. An analysis using"implicit enumeration" (ie-) of Hennig86 resulted in a cladogram of minimal length. This cladogramhas a length of 16 steps, a consistency index of 1.0, and a retention index of 1.0. Fromthe cladogram (Figure 255) and supporting synapomorphies, the following hypotheses can bemade: (1) Nostima is monophyletic; (2) Nostima and Garifuna form a monophyletic lineage(supported by three synapomorphies); (3) Garifuna is the immediate sister group of Nostima,and Philygria forms a clade immediately basal to the common lineage of Nostima and Garifuna;and (4) New World species of Nostima are provisionally arrayed into five lineages. Someof these lineages apparently demonstrate a speciation pattern in which peripheral or isolatedspecies diverged from more widely distributed species.Keys to the tribes and genera of Ilytheinae, as well as to the New World species of Nostima,are provided. Distribution maps are also produced for the New World species.

N2  - This study of the functional morphology of the male reproductive system in astacidean crustaceans has allowed for comparisons of representatives of the superfamilies Parastacoidea, Enoplometopoidea, Nephropoidea, and the Astacoidea with a focus on the crayfishes. Tissues from the testes and (to the extent possible) vasa deferentia were prepared for light and scanning electron microscopy and specimens of the following families were used: Parastacidae â€”Â€ Parastacoides tasmanicus tasmanicus, Astacopsis franklinii, Parastacus nicoleti; Enoplometopidae â€” Enoplometopus occidentalis; Nephropidae â€” Homarus americanus; Astacidae Ã¢Â€Â“ Pacifastacus leniusculus trowbridgii; Cambaridae Ã¢Â€Â“ Cambaroides japonicus, Cambaroides similis, Cambarus (Puncticambarus) acuminatus, C. (Hiaticambarus) longulus, Procambarus (Ortmannicus) fallax, P. (O.) zonangulus, P. (Scapulicambarus) paeninsulanus, and Orconectes (Procericambarus) rusticus. The single organ testis is "H-shaped" in members of the Parastacoidea, Enoplometopoidea, and Nephropoidea and consists of a pair of longitudinal lobes, each composed of an anterior and posterior lobule joined by a transverse commissure or bridge. The derived "Y-shaped" pattern of the testis of the Astacoidea is trilobed and consists of a pair of anterior lobules and a median posterior lobule that in most adult Cambaridae are joined by a trifurcate, constricted stalk, a structure that is lacking in the Cambaroidinae and Astacidae. The sac-like acini lie in the axes of the testicular lobules and produce spermatozoa. As spermatogenesis proceeds, each acinus becomes larger and, with spermiogenesis and the expulsion of spermatozoa into the collecting ducts, undergoes one or two of three fates: (1) acinus regeneration occurs and another cycle of sperm production ensues (adopted exclusively by the Astacidae and Cambaroidinae); (2) secondary acini develop in the wall of existing acini, converting the primary acinus into a passageway to the collecting tubules; or (3) the acinus degenerates and new acini arise from collecting tubules (employed only by the Cambarinae and Cambarellinae).The first and second fates have been adopted by the Parastacoidea, the Enoplometopoidea, and the Nephropoidea. In the Cambarinae and Cambarellinae, the germinal cells are recognizable only in the acinar buds from the collecting tubules and when they assume the role of spermatogonia; they are not evident along the lengths of the tubules nor are they present within an acinus after the onset of spermatogenesis. In all other astacideans examined, the germinal cells seem always to be present in the collecting tubules. Additionally, they appear in the walls of acini by the time the spermatogenic elements are being converted to spermatids, frequently forming clusters, the primordia of secondary acini in the Parastacoidea, the Nephropoidea, and occasionally the Enoplometopoidea. Germinal cells may be disposed in a partial layer or scattered within the walls of an acinus and constitute the initial spermatogonia of a new cycle of sperm production. This is what occurs in the acini of the Astacidae, Cambaroidinae, Parastacoidea, Nephropoidea, and Enoplometopoidea.

N2  - The systematics, morphology, and distributions are summarized for the 91 species and 2 subspecies of New World Opostegidae. A phylogenetic analysis using the "parsimony rachet" in Winclada and based on 34 morphological characters for the seven currently recognized world genera indicates the monotypic Chilean genus, Notiopostega, to be the basal taxon. Monophyly of the Nepticuloidea (Nepticulidae + Opostegidae) is well supported by nine morphological synapomorphies. Several synapomorphies distinguish the Opostegidae from all other Lepidoptera. Principal among these are the presence of a single, spinose seta on the larval mandible, adult wing venation extremely reduced with all veins unbranched, frenulum lost in both sexes, antennal flagellomeres each typically with 3 sets of ascoid sensillae, and a pedunculate, typically elliptical, cucullar lobe bearing a well-developed pectinifer on the valva of the male genitalia. Larval biologies of only two New World species are known. Larvae of both species mine primarily the cambium layer in woody plant stems. Results from light trap sampling at the La Selva Biological Station in Heredia Province, Costa Rica, indicated that adult Opostegidae were much more abundant in canopy habitats compared with near-ground level. Four genera (Neopostega new genus, 5 species; Notiopostega Davis, 1 species; Opostegoides Kozlov, 1 species; and Pseudopostega Kozlov, 84 species and 2 subspecies) are recognized for the New World. One genus (Neopostega) and the following 68 species and 2 subspecies are described as new: Neopostega asymmetra, Neopostega distola, Neopostega falcata, Neopostega longispina, Neopostega petila, Pseudopostega acrodicra, Pseudopostega acuminate, Pseudopostega apotoma, Pseudopostega attenuate, Pseudopostega beckeri, Pseudopostega bicornuta, Pseudopostega bidorsalis, Pseudopostega brachybasis, Pseudopostega breviapicula, Pseudopostega brevifurcata, Pseudopostega brevivalva, Pseudopostega caulifurcata, Pseudopostega clavata, Pseudopostega colognatha, Pseudopostega concave, Pseudopostega conicula, Pseudopostega constricta, Pseudopostega contigua, Pseudopostega crassifurcata, Pseudopostega curtarama, Pseudopostega denticulate, Pseudopostega didyma, Pseudopostega diskusi, Pseudopostega divaricata, Pseudopostega dorsalis dorsalis, Pseudopostega dorsalis fasciata, Pseudopostega duplicate, Pseudopostega ecuadoriana, Pseudopostega ferruginea, Pseudopostega floridensis, Pseudopostega fumida, Pseudopostega galapagosae, Pseudopostega gracilis, Pseudopostega lateriplicata, Pseudopostega latiapicula, Pseudopostega latifurcata latifurcata, Pseudopostega latifurcata apoclina, Pseudopostega latisaccula, Pseudopostega lobata, Pseudopostega longifurcata, Pseudopostega longipedicella, Pseudopostega microacris, Pseudopostega mignonae, Pseudopostega monstruosa, Pseudopostega obtuse, Pseudopostega ovatula, Pseudopostega parakempella, Pseudopostega paraplicatella, Pseudopostega plicatella, Pseudopostega resimafurcata, Pseudopostega rotunda, Pseudopostega sectila, Pseudopostega serrata, Pseudopostega spatulata, Pseudopostega sublobata, Pseudopostega subtila, Pseudopostega suffuscula, Pseudopostega tanygnatha, Pseudopostega tenuifurcata, Pseudopostega texana, Pseudopostega triangularis, Pseudopostega truncate, Pseudopostega tucumanae, Pseudopostega turquinoensis, Pseudopostega uncinata.
