N2  - A three-year study of the fish population of White Oak Lake, Roane County, Tennessee, was made in 1950-1953. That lake received the radioactive waste effluent, the chemical waste effluent, and the primary-treated sewage effluent from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Six semi-annual estimates of the size and composition of the fish population were made by the mark-and-recapture method. Immediately following the last semiannual netting study, the lake was partially drained and treated with emulsifiable rotenone. Approximately 60 percent of the fish that had been marked during the last semi-annual netting study were recovered following the treatment with rotenone. The estimated total weight of the fish population was approximately 985 pounds per acre. The data from the mark-and-recapture studies were not quantitatively sound but did provide good qualitative information on the composition of the fish population. They indicated that white crappies and redhorse were gradually disappearing from the population; these findings were corroborated by the data from the rotenone study. Age and growth data, supplemented by data on length frequencies, indicated that the fish of White Oak Lake grew more slowly and did not live so long as fish of the same species in near-by reservoirs of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Dissection of fishes provided data on the percentage composition, by weight, of the various tissues in the body. A year-round study of the food habits of the black crappie revealed that it fed primarily on larval Chaoborus and other midges and to a certain extent on copepods and cladocerans. The bluegill, on the other hand, was very omniverous and showed no such preference for certain food items. Radioassay of samples of the various tissues of the black crappie and the bluegill indicated that radiomaterials were selectively concentrated in all tissues of the body. The hard tissues selectively concentrated radiostrontium in amounts 20,000 to 30,000 times that of the water in which they lived. Some radiophosphorus was also concentrated in the hard tissues. The soft tissues selectively concentrated cesium and the rare earths. The total body burden carried by a 7-inch black crappie during the summer of 1952 was more than a microcurie, whereas that for a 6-inch bluegill was only slightly less. There were definite seasonal changes in the accumulation of radiomaterials which corresponded, to some extent, with the seasonal changes in water temperature. However, the accumulation of radiomaterials stopped when the temperature of the water reached its maximum about August 1. The rapid loss of radiomaterials during August and September indicated that both species of fish probably entered a period of summer dormancy during that time. The total radiation dose received by the fish in White Oak Lake was estimated to be at least 57 rep per year from external irradiation and was probably several times that amount from internal irradiation. As a result of this irradiation, it is believed that the fish population of White Oak Lake may have suffered deleterious effects, as manifested by the shortened life span, the slowed growth rate, and possibly the decreased fertility of the breeding stock of the redhorse.

N2  - The genus Somatolophia is revised for the first time. It is redescribed and divided into two groups, defined on the basis of male and female genitalia. Relationships within the genus are discussed, and a cladogram is presented; simplicia and cuyana form an apomorphic group and are sister species to all the others in the genus. A key is given for the species, based on male genitalia. All species are described, and both the adults and their genitalia are illustrated; distributional data are given for all species. The following species are described as new: desolata (California), montana (California), sinaloa (Sinaloa), incana (Nevada), vatia (Arizona), and petila (Texas); aberration 'obliterata' Warren is placed as a synonym of pallescens McDunnough. The members of this genus occur in the western United States and Mexico, from southern Idaho to the states of Puebla and México.

T1  - Calmoniid trilobites of the Lower Devonian Scaphiocoelia zone of Bolivia, with remarks on related species.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 165
SP  - 183
N2  - The calmoniid trilobites of the Scaphiocoelia assemblage zone (Lower Devonian) of Bolivia are described. The Scaphiocoelia Zone is the oldest Devonian unit in Bolivia and is recognized in the base of the Belén Formation, the Icla Formation, and the Gamoneda Formation, in northern, central, and southern Bolivia, respectively. Twenty-one trilobite and one eurypterid taxa are recognized from this zone, 17 of which are species of Calmoniidae. Scaphiocoelia Zone calmoniids herein described as new include one genus (Deltacephalaspis), and five subgenera (Bainella (Belenops), the nominate subgenus of Deltacephalaspis, Deltacephalaspis (Prestalia), Schizostylus (Curuyella), and Kozlowskiaspis (Romanops)). Ten new Scaphiocoelia Zone species are described: D. (Deltacephalaspis) comis, D. (D.) retrospina, D. (D.) magister, D. (Prestalia) tumida, Schizostylus (Curuyella) granulata, ?Acastoides gamonedensis, Phacopina convexa, Kozlowskiaspis (Romanops) borealis, K. (Romanops) australis, and Tarijactinoides tikanensis. Additionally, two new species are characterized but not formally diagnosed, and two others are distinguished but remain unassigned to genera. Three previously described species from the Scaphiocoelia Zone are redescribed: Bainella (Belenops) insolita (Wolfart), Parabouleia calmonensis Eldredge, and Tarijactinoides jarcasensis Suárez Soruco. The vicariant pattern within Bolivia, and the biogeographic affinities of Bolivia with other areas within the Malvino-Kaffric Province are briefly discussed. We also present a general discussion of calmoniid anatomy and taxic diversity. Non-Scaphiocoelia Zone trilobites from Bolivia and elsewhere are also described, discussed or figured as a consequence of our study of the Scaphiocoelia Zone material. We describe the new genus Andinacaste from the Silurian of Bolivia. We describe as new Andinacaste legrandi and Phacopina padilla, the latter from the Icla Formation, above the Scaphiocoelia Zone, at Padilla, Bolivia. We present formal revisions for the following six genera: Bainella, Schizostylus, Phacopina, Kozlowskiaspis, Parabouleia, and Tarijactinoides. We discuss the status of three additional genera: Probolops, Acastoides, and Scotiella. We formally revise Kozlowskiaspis (Kozlowskiaspis) superna and Andinacaste chojnacotensis. Finally, we also discuss or figure an additional 15 calmoniid and acastid species in conjunction with our analysis of the composition of the calmoniid component of the Scaphiocoelia Zone fauna.

T1  - Birds of Karkar and Bagabag islands, New Guinea.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 164
SP  - 469
N2  - We analyze the avifaunas of Karkar and Bagabag, two Quaternary volcanic islands off the northeast coast of New Guinea. Our discussion is based on collections and observations of birds, and incidental collections of mammals, made on these islands in 1969. The first part of our discussion considers general features of interest in the avifaunas, and the second part consists of individual species accounts. Most bats and nonvolant mammals of Karkar and Bagabag occur in the adjacent New Guinea lowlands and on other nearby islands. However, the bat Pteropus tonganus is otherwise absent from the New Guinea and Bismarck regions, though widespread on more remote Pacific archipelagoes from the New Hebrides eastward. As judged by distributions and subspecific affinities, most bird species have been derived from New Guinea, except for seven species (including four small-island specialists or 'supertramps') derived from the Bismarck Archipelago. There are no endemic forms. Most of the bird species are superior overwater colonists shared with other nearby islands. Altitudinal ranges are plotted for all resident species of Karkar. Species number decreases regularly with altitude. Altitudinal limits of different species show little tendency to coincide: i.e., there is little altitudinal zonation of the avifauna. Eight species on Karkar are confined to the mountains. Comparison of the resident avifauna of Karkar in 1969 with that determined by Meek's collectors in 1914 yields a minimum turnover rate of 0.34 percent of Karkar's bird populations turning over (immigrating or going extinct) per year. Karkar and Bagabag support only a fraction of the bird species found in similar habitats on New Guinea. Total population densities on Karkar and Bagabag are considerably below those on New Guinea. Due to this reduction in interspecific competition, half of the species on Karkar undergo niche shifts--i.e., occupy broader altitudinal, habitat, or vertical ranges or live at higher densities than do the source populations on New Guinea. Study of primary molt and gonad condition of collected specimens and nest records permit tentative conclusions about reproductive cycles for most species. Few species breed in the dry season except for frugivores. Some species, especially wide-ranging colonizers, increase their reproductive potential by molt-breeding overlap, adventitious breeding, or both. Our accounts of individual species report measurements and weights of collected specimens, color of soft parts, local names, breeding and molt data, stomach contents, taxonomic conclusions, and voice and other field observations.

N2  - One. The organization of a school of Jenkinsia is based on visual cues which become inoperative at just about the visual limit in man under certain conditions or before it under others. 2. Normally a school of Jenkinsia maintains a specified distance from solid vertical objects such as piles, and approaches twice as close to light-colored ones as to dark-colored. 3. The formation of a mill in Jenkinsia, typically based on extrinsic factors, may evidently under certain conditions be based on strictly intrinsic factors. 4. A mill of 3 feet in diameter of about 500 fish had members at the periphery traveling at about 3 inches per second. 5. Such a mill traveling around the wall of a circular tank traveled at the rate of about 1.4 feet per minute. 6. Individual fish near the center of a mill are more closely spaced than are those at its periphery. 7. A mill passing along a wall moves in a direction that a wheel would in rolling along a similar surface but with many more revolutions than a wheel would show without slipping. 8. Isolation of an individual or a small group for as short a time as a week will cause them to show reluctance to join a larger group. 9. Effects of weather such as rippled surface of the water or passing clouds tend to loosen the school, so that it is found in its most striking cohesive form close to the surface on days of clear skies and no wind. 10. Small differences in water temperature control the form and location of a school to a marked extent, certain isothermal lines acting as an effective barrier to the passage of such schools. 11. Within a school of somewhat mixed sizes there appears to be continual self-sorting, resulting in fish of the most nearly similar sizes being found together. 12. Aggressive behavior and aggregating tendencies are considered in theoretical terms in reference to school formation, simple aggregation, and solitary habits. 13. Further analytical suggestions are indicated with reference to future work extending to greater refinement of method than has been possible up to the present.

T1  - The sloughing of the melanic area of the dorsal fin, an ontogenetic process in Tylosurus raphidoma.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 99
SP  - 1
N2  - Small juvenile Tylosurus raphidoma (Ranzani) concomitantly develop elongation of the posterior rays of the dorsal fins and mandibular lappets. Both structures are areas of intense melanin concentration. 2. Larger juveniles and sexually mature adults lack both these features, having no mandibular lappets and possessing a dorsal fin which is high anteriorly and low posteriorly, and shows no concentration of melanophores at any place. 3. The metamorphosis from one form into the other is evidently rapid, for individuals in the state of transformation are not nearly so common as those above and below the size at which it occurs. 4. This transformation takes place when the fish are 200 mm. and 300 mm. in standard length and long before sexual maturity is attained which at the earliest is not under 600 mm.; therefore it is evidently not under the control of endocrine changes which take place at the attainment of sexual maturity. 5. The transformation takes place at an age of approximately six months, and sexual maturity is not attained until a year has passed. 6. Individuals in the transitional stage may be found in the summer and fall, most of the spawning evidently taking place in the first half of the year. 7. The black areas of the dorsal are reduced not by resorption but by a process of sloughing off. The melanophores break down first, the fin membranes then disintegrate, and finally the fin rays snap off at their articulations. 8. Before the destructive changes take place, the final form of the fin is foreshadowed by the shape of the melanic area of the juvenile fin. 9. A change in behavior takes place before the process of sloughing off occurs, the young juveniles associating with floating twigs or stems about their own size and general color. After they stop this association, the changes described take place, and from then on they avoid such objects and live freely in open water. 10. Histological examination of the mandibular lappets of Tylosurus and the barbels of Cypselurus showed that these structures are eliminated by a process of resorption. 11. The presence of large numbers of coarse granular eosinophiles in all these involuting structures may be associated either with parasitism or with the resorption process. 12. No taste buds were found to be present in either the belonid lappets or the exocoetid barbels which are evidently homologous, a condition apparently unique among teleost oral appendages.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 103
SP  - 379
N2  - Embryos of the mouthbreeding cichlid fish Tilapia macrocephala do not survive, extra-orally, in aquarium water taken from the tank in which the spawning occurred. Experiments were performed to determine the role of oral incubation in embryonic survival. The approach used was to find methods of raising the embryos extra-orally and to relate extra-oral survival with the factors of survival in the milieu of the oral cavity. To facilitate this study, a series of embryological stages were described and defined from fertilization to hatching. Certain of the more obvious microscopic changes were described in conjunction with the gross descriptions of the stages. The most effective experimental media were 40 per cent sea water and sterile aquarium water in which mean embryonic survival ranged between 80 and 85 per cent. The common factor found in these media was their capability of keeping the bacterial growth that killed the embryos to a minimum. The limited effectiveness of other experimental media, e.g., NaCl, artificial sea water, methylene blue, and lysozyme, was dependent on a balance between their toxic properties and their bactericidal (or bacteriostatic) properties. Fungus mycelia usually appeared on embryos raised extra-orally in aquarium water. However, it was demonstrated experimentally that the fungus was a secondary invader, since survival was high when embryos were raised in sterile aquarium water to which a fungus culture had been introduced. Conversely, no embryos survived when they were raised in sterile water to which a culture of bacteria had been introduced. The churning action of the mouth was found to be one of the survival factors in oral incubation. When embryos were placed in a small quantity of aquarium water in a mechanical shaker, survival rates were good. On the other hand, embryos that remained stationary while a large quantity of water flowed over them never survived. These experiments show that the slow mechanical churning of the embryos in the mouth is a factor in survival, whereas the quantity of water flowing over the embryos during respiration of the parent is not critical. The oral epithelium may secrete mucus which protects the embryos. However, experiments designed to test the protective nature of mucus were not conclusive. Special pharyngeal glands, described in this paper, may secrete a bactericidal agent. Similar glands were found in Tilapia ovalis and have been described in two other mouthbreeding cichlids, while we were unable to find them in two non-mouthbreeding species of the genus Tilapia.

The Cornell Dam Member (new) in the basal Valentine Formation has salient lithic features and geologic relationships not found in other members of the Valentine. Basal channel sand disconformably overlying the Rosebud Formation contains macro- and microinvertebrate fossils (Norden Fauna, new) that also show the ecological and faunal distinction of this member. Fission track dates suggest that Valentine sediments spanned one and perhaps three million years. The Merritt Dam Member (new) of late Clarendonian to late Hemphillian age, disconformably overlies the Cap Rock Member of the referred Ash Hollow Formation. The Merritt Dam Member is less cliff forming than the Cap Rock Member, contains more volcanic ash and local channel and pond sediments. Tectonic readjustment caused deep channel erosion through the Ogallala into Arikaree rocks on the east flank of the Chadron Arch and eastward into the Cap Rock Member and the Valentine Formation. Sediments filling some of these channels contain vertebrate fossils overlain by vitric tuffs with a fission track date of 9.5 [+ or -] 0.8 Ma. The paleogeomorphology of the Ogallala Group and its depositonal framework is the product of overlapping alluvial fans of at least three paleodrainage systems which filled pre-existing valleys and spread sediments over a vast Great Plains area in Nebraska and South Dakota. In north-central Nebraska widespread aggradation and two short periods of degradation occurred during the Valentinian. Gradual aggradation during the early Clarendonian was followed by intermittent aggradation and degradation during the late Clarendonian and Hemphillian. The stratigraphic allocation and history of 98 collecting localities and documentation of 90 holotypes of fossil vertebrates and 13 plants provide a firm base for continued research. The prinipal aquifer in the Ogallala is the Crookston Bridge Member of the Valentine Formation.

VL  - 114
SP  - 331
N2  - The histo-morphology of the ovaries of the pediculates Histrio histrio, Antennarius scaber, and Ogcocephalus vespertilio is described. 2. The ovaries of all three species show similar characteristics: fusion of the two glands at their caudal ends, presence of ovigerous tissue on one side of the lumen only, and considerable quantities of smooth muscle in the walls. 3. The ovaries of Histrio and Antennarius consist of flattened sacs scrolled from the distal lateral tips ventrally towards the midline of fusion; the ovary of Ogcocephalus is scrolled along the longitudinal axis of each ovary, the long edges of the organ rolled ventrally. 4. The structure of the egg raft of Histrio is described. The mucoid material in which the ova are embedded is secreted by the epithelium lining the ovarian walls and covering the lamellae. At ovulation, the mucoid material is cast into the lumen along with the ova which have ruptured from the follicles. The form of the raft is a replica of the internal surfaces of the ovary. 5. Pores in the raft are formed by spaces caused by the junction of lamellae with the ovarian wall where no mucus-producing epithelium is present. When the raft is released, sea water enters the pores, presumably carrying sperm with it. Each ovum is then confined in its own mucoid-walled compartment, free to revolve in the sea water contained within the compartment. 6. The frequency of raft release by mature female Histrio was found to vary between once every three days and intervals of several weeks. 7. The explosive character of the release of the raft is discussed. The central portion of the raft, from the fused part of the ovary immediately above the oviduct, issues from the vent first, followed by the portion from one side of the ovary, followed in turn by the portion from the remaining side. The ovulation takes many hours to complete; the final release is affected by pressure of the mass within the ovary, contractions of the muscular ovarian wall, and contractions of the abdominal muscles. 8. A detailed description of the early embryology of Antennarius is given, with a short comparison with Histrio development. Development of these pelagic larvae shows several deviations from the classic pattern of vertebrate embryology. Up to the time of their death, nine days after having been spawned, the following features were noted to be lacking: vitelline circulation, hemoglobin and blood cells, and nephric tubules. No division of somites into somatopleure and splanchnopleure could be identified. No true proctodeum or stromadeum is developed, as there is no invagination of outside ectoderm in these areas. A simple slit appears in the outer covering. The yolk is absorbed by the liver. 9. The larvae possess large subdermal spaces and specialized structures in the outside ectoderm. The possible relationship of these structures to osmoregulatory functions is considered in the Discussion.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 67
SP  - 181
N2  - 1. The Perissodactyla show a very early and very fundamental dichotomy into two suborders, for which the names Solidungula and Tridactyla could be appropriately revived. The family Hyrachyidae is a very primitive group of the Rhinocerotoidea, and still closely resembles the other Eocene families of the suborder Tridactyla. The family is known from the Eocene (Lost Cabin to Uinta, inclusive) of Wyoming, Utah, Colorado and Montana. It includes four genera, of which Hyrachyus is by far the best known. Hyrachyus has the greatest time range of any American Eocene ungulate genus, and has an unusually long range for a placental mammal. The taxonomy, stratigraphic distribution and probable phylogeny are summarized in figure 1. 2. The genus Hyrachyus apparently includes three contemporary main series (consisting of small, medium-sized and large forms, two of which series have side branches, of which a few are rather aberrant in one or more characters). Each series contains successive grades of organization which are best treated as species. It is significant that when known from sufficiently numerous specimens, the individual measurements of the representatives of each species form normal curves of distribution, with relatively slight, or no, overlapping with other contemporary forms, or with earlier or later forms. Certain of these forms are now sufficiently well documented to deserve rank as index fossils for their respective horizons. H. modestus is an index fossil for the Lower Bridger, H. eximius and H. princeps for the Upper Bridger, and the genus Hyrachyus is very characteristic of the Bridger in general, although not confined to it. 3. Paired horns appear independently in the second and third genera of the family, Colonoceras and Metahyrachyus. Colonoceras is close to H. affinis. Metahyrachyus is a rather aberrant form, particularly as to P[superscript]2, in which the peculiar 'amphiloph' parallels the similar development in P[superscript]3 of the horses. 4. The fourth genus, Ephyrachyus, not previously separated from Hyrachyus, is the most advanced member of the family, and shows progress toward a rhinocerine grade of organization. It could hardly be ancestral to any of the American or European true rhinoceroses, but might conceivably lead to Caenolophus of Mongolia, especially to C. obliquus. I doubt Matthew's view that Caenolophus might be ancestral to the true rhinoceroses, since it is rather too late in time, nor can I accept his alternative hypothesis that primitive amynodonts were the ancestors of the true rhinoceroses. On the contrary, this study confirms the traditional view that the Hyrachyidae are approximate, morphological ancestors of the other rhinocerotoids, although the actual common ancestor has probably not yet been discovered, and should be found in the early Lower Eocene, in view of the presence of a true rhinoceros, Prohyracodon, in the Auversian of Transylvania (Wood, 1929b). 5. The Hyrachyidae agree with other lines (Matthew, 1909) in suggesting a hiatus between the Lower and Upper Bridger. The following new stratigraphic names are proposed, to represent units which are already rather widely, although tacitly, accepted: Black's Fork, Twin Buttes, Wagonhound, and Myton. Emmons Peak is proposed as a substitute for 'Uinta' Quartzite, and Green Cove for 'so-called Bridger.' The Sage Creek Beds are apparently of either Lower Uinta or Upper Bridger age. Cook Ranch is proposed for new Middle Oligocene Beds in the Sage Creek region of Montana. 6. Study of the brain casts of the hyrachyids, as compared with more primitive and more progressive forms, illustrates the same tendencies seen in other lines. 7. It is possible to follow the evolution of the permanent premolars, deciduous premolars, and molars. In some of the lines, the metamorphosis of the upper premolars may be followed step by step, from one horizon and its species to the next. It is not possible to do this for the lower premolars and deciduous premolars, but general trends may be recognized. Although the molars are usually notable for their conservatism, some changes may be observed. Evolution of the upper and lower teeth usually moves pari passu, as would be predicted, thereby safeguarding the occlusal relations, or if aberrant changes do occur, they are of such a character as not to interfere with the occlusion. All phases of the evolution of the cheek teeth conform to mechanical principles, but there is no evidence favoring orthogenetic or neo-Lamarckian interpretations of this accordance. On the contrary, the data may best be explained on the strictly neo-Darwinian basis of natural selection from among random mutations.

T1  - New Paleocene insectivores and insectivore classification.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 135
SP  - 219
N2  - New genera and species are Pantinomia ambigua and Pantomimus leari, both possible pantolestids from the middle Paleocene; Leptonysson basiliscus, a middle Paleocene leptictid; and the apheliscines Parapheliscus bjorni and P. wapitiensis, the former from the late Paleocene and the latter from the early Eocene. Palaeosinopa senior is made the type of a new genus, Paleotomus, of the Palaeoryctidae, and the formerly referred specimens of this species are made a new species, Palaeosinopa simpsoni, of the Pantolestidae. These new taxa and other evidence indicate that the interrelationships of early Cenozoic insectivores are even more poorly understood than is commonly believed. The Pentacodontinae are removed from the Pantolestidae, provisionally as a separate family, and a number of generic synonymies and transfers of genera are made. These changes, together with a generic revision of the Leptictidae and other suggestions, do not greatly clarify which similarities among the families are convergent and which are indicative of relationship. A classification of the insectivores and deltatheridians is given that differs in a number of respects from the others available. New suprageneric taxa are the following: Erinaceota and Hyaenodonta, new suborders; Adapisoriculinae, Unuchiniinae Van Valen and McKenna, Thylacaelurinae, and Gypsonictopinae, new subfamilies; and Scaptonychini, new tribe. Primitive erinaceoids are more or less arbitrarily grouped into four subfamilies of the Adapisoricidae. The interrelations of moles are discussed. A family Plesiosoricidae is included in the Soricoidea. All zalambdodonts are tentatively removed from the Insectivora to the Deltatheridia, and recent work on the Hyaenodonta is critically reviewed. The Dermoptera and Macrocroscelidea are treated as suborders of the Insectivora.

N2  - The results of this investigation tend to show that the characters of phylogenetic value are those not easily affected by the immediate environment or by the habits of a species. These characters have determined the main lines of development and are of value in determining groups of the grade of class, order, or suborder. They are deep-seated characters and include the vertebral structure, the basals of the paired fins and of the myxopterygia, the jaw attachment, and the rostral cartilages. The physiological characters are those which appear to have direct application to the environment or habits of the species. They cause wide variation within the groups determined by the phylogenetic characters and may be used in determining family, genus, or species relationships. These characters include the radials of the pectoral fin, the axial cartilages of the myxopterygia, the position of the dorsal fins, the teeth and denticles, the mouth and nostrils, the general body form, and all modifications of the skin such as folds, keels, pits, etc. The phylogenetic characters determine the lines of adaptive radiation and the physiological characters determine the adaptive radiation within the subgroups. The phylogenetic characters were laid down during the geological age of origin and when present today have been retained. The physiological characters may continue to vary at the present time. Certain physiological characters have become linked to the phylogenetic so consistently that linkage groups are suggested. Slight variations from the linkage may mean crossing over. The modern groups which were separated from the main stock more recently have proved to be more stable than those originating at an earlier time. Variation is, therefore, found in the more primitive groups and these may be supposed to be still in a varying or mutating condition. Certain species have been found to vary in characters otherwise typical of a group and these may represent mutating species. Feeding habits seem to have determined the direction of tooth development; temperature and water pressure, denticle development; depth and water pressure, the general body form, position of the dorsal fins, and numerous dermal specializations. Bottom and shallow water habits have determined the movement of the nostrils toward the mouth, the width of the mouth gape, the size of the spiracles, and the spreading of the pectoral fins. Restricted environments have tended to lengthen the body and free environments to deepen the body and increase bulk, leading in either direction to over-specialization in some cases. The intermediate grovelling type has been primitive in any group because of the fundamental need for securing food, which would have been primarily more abundant close to the shores. The Hexanchea and Holocephali branched from the ancestral stock during the Paleozoic; the Hybodonts, in the Triassic; the Squalea, Platosomeae, Orectoloboidea and Catuloidea, in the Jurassic; the Odontaspoidea and Isuroidea, in the Cretaceous; the Carcharinoidea, in the Eocene. The groups established in the Jurassic have been less stable than those of later origin and appear to be still in mutating condition. An hypothetical ancestral shark may be constructed on the basis of characters found to be primitive: A grovelling shore type depressed anteriorly, tapering toward the tail; mouth wide, nearly terminal and ventral; nostrils very near the mouth with a nasoral groove; eyes large, lateral, with large spiracle behind them and without a nictitating fold or membrane; gill slits five in number, lateral and wide, all open to the exterior, all anterior to the pectoral fins and at equal distances apart; two spiny dorsal fins of equal size with ridges and ornamentations on the spines, the first over or just back of the pelvic fins; a large anal fin; a caudal fin with axis not raised and without notches, keels, or pits; denticles as flat plates with bases fitted together; teeth small, multicuspid, with a broad base deeply embedded in the jaw; coloration uniform, lighter below; the rostral support absent; the jaw suspension amphyhyostylic and the pterygoquadrate articulation extensive; the basals of the pectoral fins of equal size and expansion, the radials unsegmented rods about equally distributed on the basals; the notochord unconstricted, the vertebrae with no secondary calcifications; a condition of diplospondyly in the tail; the spiral valves of the spiral type with from five to ten valves; the heart valves in three series arranged in two rows; the myxopterygia absent indicating an oviparous habit with external fertilization; the fish probably lived in the early Devonian and followed the armored Stegoselachians. The results of the present investigation show the need of reorganization in the order Galea. Previous classifications have either included the Orectolobidae with the Catulidae or given them parallel standing. There are two types of vertebral structure in the Galea: the Orectoloboidea have one type, and the Catuloidea have the transitional stages approaching the other. I believe the two types of vertebrae to have had a separate origin in the Jurassic, and the two groups to represent, therefore, fundamentally distinct groups. These I have called suborders, within which the Orectoloboidea form the stem group of one, and the Catuloidea the stem group of the other. Therefore superfamilies have been established and the members of the order Galea have been distributed according to the foregoing key (p. 109).

N2  - This paper consists of a series of eight studies on Paleocene and Eocene fossil primates. The first describes Jepsenella, new genus, type J. praepropera, new species, from the Middle Paleocene of Montana, referred to the Apatemyidae, of which it is the oldest known member. The second describes Loveina, new genus, type L. zephyri, new species, from the Lower Eocene of Wyoming, an anaptomorphid allied to Omomys and Washakius. The third proposes and defines the new genus Teilhardina for Omomys belgicus Teilhard, 1927, from the Lower Eocene of Belgium, pointing out that this is quite distinct from, although allied to, Omomys and that it appears to be the most generalized known tarsioid. In the fourth study, a partial skeleton referred to Hemiacodon from the Middle Eocene of Wyoming is described The skeleton of this supposed tarsioid is found to be unique in several respects and to resemble the lemuroids at least as much as the true tarsioids, and the possible bearings of this unexpected fact on primate history are discussed. The fifth divides the large family Anaptomorphidae into five subfamilies, Omomyinae, Paromomyinae, Anaptomorphinae, Necrolemurinae and Pseudolorisinae, defining each and discussing them briefly. The sixth study is devoted to the relationships of the five families of Paleocene and Eocene primates to each other and to the Primates in general. Pronycticebus, Caenopithecus and Anchomomys are referred to the lemuriform family Adapidae in addition to the genera commonly placed there. The Plesiadapidae are held to be definitely lemuroid and not specially related to Daubentonia. The Apatemyidae may not be primates at all, but there is at present no other less doubtful place to put them. The Carpolestidae appear to be a peculiarly aberrant offshoot of the proto-primate and probably prototarsioid stock. The usual view that the Anaptomorphidae are tarsioids is accepted, but the contents of the family are somewhat modified and it is pointed out that it is heterogeneous and may now include some non-tarsioid genera. In the seventh study knowledge of early primate distribution is summarized and the occurrences of each of the 55 genera tentatively accepted as valid are given in tabular form. The last, eighth, section gives a selected bibliography of the subject and an alphabetical list of valid genera with references by which the important literature on each can readily be found.

N2  - A group of late Carboniferous actinopterygian fishes is described and referred to the genera Haplolepis Miller, 1892 (syn. Mecolepis Newberry, 1856, Eurylepis Newberry, 1857 - both preoccupied), and Pyritocephalus Fritsch, 1893 (syn. Teleopterina Berg, 1936). They are from six localities, of which the stratigraphical horizons can be stated by reference to Dix's succession of Coal-Measures floras. Haplolepis is divided into two new subgenera, Haplolepis (sensu stricto) and Parahaplolepis. The following species are described: Haplolepis (Haplolepis) ovoidea (Newberry), Linton, Ohio, Zone H-I (Syn.

In several cases it has been possible to make very detailed reconstructions of the dermal bones and the body, but remains of the endoskeleton are too bad for description. The fishes are shown to be closely related and sharply marked off from all other known Carboniferous Actinopterygii; the new family, Haplolepidae, is set up for their reception. It is shown that the family was probably derived from the lower Carboniferous Canobius, which in turn is derived through Mesopoma from a series of 'normal' palaeoniscoids allied to Rhadinichthys. The family was thus well separated from most Carboniferous evolutionary lines within the palaeoniscoids. It is shown that Aeduella Westoll is not a close relative of the Haplolepidae and that the resemblances are largely due to parallel evolution; and that Trissolepis Fritsch, of which the skull roof has been described as fenestrated in a manner similar to that of Pyritocephalus, is probably of normal palaeoniscoid structure with an entire skull roof. The subgenera of Haplolepis and Pyritocephalus are separate throughout their known range, but Pyritocephalus was certainly derived from an early Parahaplolepis. The comparative anatomy of the dermal bones, the body, and the fins is discussed in detail. Peculiar modifications of the skull roof and cheek, some of them independently undergone in different members of the group, are demonstrated. The development and significance of the paired fenestrations in the skull roof of Pyritocephalus are discussed. Attention is given also to the remarkable modifications of the snout, external nares, and opercular apparatus; to the presence of a flattened venter between the paired fins, associated with a modified course of the scale rows of the body; to the frequent development of very deep scales on the anterior flank; to the modifications leading to the extreme thinness of the scales; to the latero-sensory system, which is very fully developed, and includes main and accessory, together with dorsal and ventral, lateral lines, the last described for the first time in an actinopterygian; and to the significance of the structure and nature of the dermal fin rays and of the relative positions of the fins. Many of the characters demonstrated in Haplolepidae are to be found also in some members of the 'Holostei' and 'Sub-Holostei.' A critical discussion of the status of these unnatural groups leads to a general statement of a new hypothesis of the evolution of the 'holostean' condition, in which it is shown that the characteristic modification of the tail fin has happened independently in different lineages and is correlated with a great change in habitat and environment. This section is based largely on a consideration of the fish as a swimming organism. The geographical distribution of the Haplolepidae is remarkably extensive for so specialized a family. In particular, the highly specialized Pyritocephalus sculptus from Bohemia is extremely similar in all details to the contemporaneous P. lineatus from Ohio. An analysis of the probable conditions of deposition of the rocks yielding the fossils leads to the conclusion that the Haplolepidae were fresh-water fishes thoroughly adapted to life in stagnant swamps, and almost certainly incapable of migration by sea. The implications of such conclusions in the understanding of the distribution and nature of Coal-Measures swamps and on the theory of continental drift are considered. The faunas associated with Haplolepidae are shown to include certain peculiar Amphibia, the distribution of which is extremely closely correlated with that of the fishes. The fate of this 'facies fauna' is described, and the food relations of the various members are briefly noted.

N2  - In this review, material on the separation and assay of isotopes is presented. All of the available evidence on isotope effects in the biosphere is collected and discussed. The reader will find that while on the one hand a large fund of data is available on the laboratory separation and assay of isotopes, there is a paucity of reliable data on geochemical isotope effects. This situation arises from the fact that only recently have assay methods methods reached the precision required for application to geochemistry. The special role of biological systems in affecting isotope separations still remains to be established. Preliminary data already reveal such effects for hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon, and perhaps potassium. It can hardly be doubted that careful systematic studies with the newer techniques available will contribute much more valuable data, as well as resolve anomalies and uncertainties now existing in the present data.

N2  - Inasmuch as the frequency distributions of many biological data approach the normal probability curve as developed by statisticians it is often possible for the taxonomist to adopt various statistical measures based on this type of distribution in the systematic analyses of biological material. The ones most commonly employed by the systematist to analyze normally distributed data are those of the central tendency (mean, median, and mode), of variation (standard deviation), of variability (coefficient of variability), and of reliability (standard errors). The mean is an expression of the average tendency in the sample and serves as a point on the variation scale from which the measure of variation can be oriented. The median and mode are measures of central tendency used primarily in comparing the frequency distribution of the sample with the normal curve to reveal possible skewness. The standard deviation is the measure of variation with which the systematist estimates the range of variation in the population from which a particular sample was taken. The population range is calculated as the mean of the sample plus and minus three standard deviations of the sample (M [plus or minus] 3 S.D.) which gives the systematist the range of variation within which would occur approximately 100 per cent of the total population represented by that sample. The coefficient of variability enables the systematist to establish the relationship between the variation and the mean size of the sample, giving the relative variability which can then be used in making comparisons. The standard errors indicate the reliability of the preceding measures and are used to show the systematist the theoretical range of variation of any of these measures, within which range would be found the same measures of additional samples drawn from the same population. With these statistical tools and a knowledge of the biology and distribution of the population, the systematist should be able to establish more accurately the classification status of his samples.

T1  - The ancestral crocodilian Protosuchus.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 97
SP  - 147
N2  - In this paper there are presented a description in detail and a discussion of Protosuchus richardsoni, from the Dinosaur Canyon beds of northern Arizona. It is shown that the Dinosaur Canyon beds are intermediate in position between the typical Upper Triassic Chinle formation below, and the supposed Lower Jurassic sediments above. Consequently, the relationships of the Dinosaur Canyon beds and its contained fossils to the Triassic below or the Jurassic above are a question open to some differences of opinion. Protosuchus is definitely a primitive crocodilian. It is small as crocodilians go, being about 1 meter in length. The skull is rather short and broad and quite crocodilian in many of its features. For instance, the skull roof shows a characteristic crocodilian arrangement of bones, with the squamosal, the parietals, and the frontals enlarged, and with the supratemporal fenestrae reduced in size. The top of the cranial region is quite flat, as is typical of many crocodilians. There is no antorbital fenestra, which is a character diagnostic for the crocodilians. In some respects, however, Protosuchus shows either primitive characters or special features in the skull. The orbit is directed more laterally than in most crocodilians. The snout is short, yet in the front part of the dental series there is a long diastema between the last premaxillary tooth, which is enlarged, and the first maxillary tooth, a most peculiar specialization for a crocodilian. There seemingly are 24 presacral vertebrae in Protosuchus, a number similar to that for the crocodilians, while there are two sacrals and about 35 caudals. The vertebrae are platycoelous, and in the dorsolumbar and caudal regions they have somewhat elongated centra, while the spines are closely comparable in relative height and strength to the vertebral spines in other crocodilians. Protosuchus shows a definite advance towards the crocodilians in the extension of the transverse processes, to which the ribs are articulated by both head and tubercle in the region behind the neck. The shoulder girdle is strongly crocodilian in that the coracoid is greatly elongated to such a degree that it is almost equal to the scapula in size. The bones of the leg are similar to those of the Crocodilia, and the radiale and ulnare in the carpus are elongated fully as much as they are in typical crocodilians of Mesozoic, Cenozoic, and Recent times. The pelvis is characterized by the elongated, rod-like pubis, a crocodilian character, but proximally this bone participates in the acetabulum, whereas in later crocodilians it is completely excluded from the acetabulum. The ischium is large, and the two ischia are joined by an extensive symphysis. The ilium is elongated anteriorly to form a strong process above and in front of the acetabulum. As in the fore limb, the bones of the hind limb are very much like the same bones in other crocodilians. The astragalus and calcancum on the tarsus are enlarged, and the latter bone is characterized by its large, expanded tuber. The fifth digit is reduced to a short, metatarsal hook, a character that is inherited by the crocodilians from their thecodont ancestors. The body armor is heavy. On the back there is a double row of rectangular scutes running along the midline, while the belly and the ventral and lateral surfaces of the tail are protected by smaller rectangular scutes. This array of characters indicates the strong crocodilian habitus of Protosuchus, for it is evident that in most respects this reptile is a true crocodilian. It does retain certain thecodont heritage characters, but these are quite secondary in importance as compared with the crocodilian features that typify the genus. Such resemblances as are apparent between Protosuchus and the thecodonts, especially genera like Aetosaurus and Stegomus, are clearly due to the persistence in Protosuchus of basic thecodont heritage characters or to parallelism in evolution. On the other hand the resemblances between Protosuchus and the South African genera Notochampsa and Erythrochampsa are close and are based on the comparisons of crocodilian habitus characters. Therefore, Protosuchus, Notochampsa, and Erythrochampsa are without much doubt closely related, and are here considered as members of a single family and suborder of ancestral crocodilians.

T1  - The Phenacolemuridae, new family of early primates.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 105
SP  - 415
N2  - The Tiffanian through Wasatchian North American genus Phenacolemur represents a highly distinctive group here defined as a family: Phenacolemuridae. The Torrejonian genus Paromomys, although more primitive than Phenacolemur, foreshadows most of its peculiarities and is tentatively placed in the same family. The likewise Torrejonian Palaechthon, although less like Phenacolemur, seems to be related to Paromomys and is still more tentatively referred to the family. Palenochtha and Plesiolestes may possibly also belong in this general group, but are not now referred to it. Phenacolemur, as now known, includes four species: Tiffanian P. frugivorus and P. pagei and Wasatchian P. praecox and P. jepseni. Phenacolemur praecox is heterogeneous, but included taxa cannot be sharply distinguished by available samples. There is some suggestion of distinguishable early populations of larger and later of smaller individuals in the Willwood formation, and these are tentatively redefined as subspecies. There is no evident progressive tendency among the species of Phenacolemur. They represent non-progressive deployment within an early established and specialized generic pattern. The generic pattern of the dentition is characterized especially by a nipping pair of incisors, reduction of other teeth anterior to P[superscript 4][subscript 4], retention and enlargement of P[superscript 4][subscript 4], short, transversely quadrate molar trigonids, great development of a third lobe on M[subscript 3], and development of a talon basin but no hypoconid on M[superscript 1-3]. The Phenacolemuridae represent a sharply distinct special group or line, extinct without issue, and with eclectic resemblances suggesting origin from the same unspecialized ancestry as the Omomyinae, Notharctinae, Plesiadapidae, Necrolemuridae, and others. On this basis, the Phenacolemuridae are considered Primates and Prosimii. The advisability or, indeed, possibility of dividing Paleocene-Eocene Prosimii into Tarsiiformes (or Tarsioidea) and Lemuriformes (or Lemuroidea) is strongly questioned. The Phenacolemuridae are considered one of many divergent, extinct early families that do not properly belong in either of those later Cenozoic groups.

T1  - American Hyracotherium (Perissodactyla, Equidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 110
SP  - 1
N2  - The teeth of Hyracotherium are in most respects quite primitive. They do, however, possess well-developed lophs and lophids, and in one species there is a definite tendency towards the molarization of P[superscript 3]. Although the teeth of Hyracotherium are in most respects more primitive than those of the phenacodontids, the possession of a mesostyle excludes all phenacodontid genera except Desmatoclaenus from the ancestry of Hyracotherium. The skull of Hyracotherium is not strikingly similar to the skulls of later horses. The orbit is relatively more posteriorly located than it is in any of the condylarths, and in the arrangement and relationship of the skull bones Hyracotherium closely resembles Mesohippus. The lumbar neural spines are almost vertical, indicating a relative unimportance of the longissimus muscle. Some of the lumbar zygopophyses were apparently embracing. In these characters Hyracotherium resembles the later horses. It is probable that the lumbar series was relatively inflexible. The scapula and fore limb are remarkably primitive, while the pelvis and hind limb exhibit most of the fundamental equid specializations. The feet, although strongly mesodactyl, were digitigrade. In view of the structure of the vertebral column, pelvis, and hind limb it is probable that Hyracotherium ran more or less in the typical ungulate manner, gaining most the propulsive force from the action of the hind limb relative to the pelvis rather than from an alternate flexing and straightening of the back. All the Lower Eocene perissodactyls are very similar in general structure, and it is only in the structure of the teeth and the astragalus and calcaneum that Hyracotherium is more horse-like than its closely related contemporaries. A study of large samples of teeth has shown that most of the specific characters cited by earlier authors show great variation within single populations. On the basis of the structure of P[superscript 3] and  P[superscript 4] three species have been recognized, one from the Gray Bull and equivalents, and two from the Lost Cabin and Lysite and equivalents. Subspecies have been defined on the basis of significant mean tooth size differences. It is possible that two subspecies found in the Almagre member of the San Jose formation, H. a. etsagicum and H. a. angustidens, which were partially isolated but apparently in competition, gave rise to the two late Wasatchian species H. vasacciense and H. craspedotum. Hyracotherium v. venticolum from the Lost Cabin member of the Wind River formation is clearly the most advanced form of the genus and is undoubtedly ancestral to the genus Orohippus.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 112
SP  - 129
N2  - One. A large collection, mainly of isolated molars, from Águas do Araxá, Brazil, seems to represent a single population within a species identified as Haplomastodon waringi. The variation, described in some detail, is far greater than has hitherto usually been taken into consideration in the diagnosis of supposed species of mastodonts. 2. Mastodonts have been found at many localities scattered throughout Brazil. A few specimens are anomalous, but the great majority belong to, or are at least inseparable from, H. waringi on the basis of known characters. 3. Ecuadorian Haplomastodon is not at present specifically separable from H. waringi, and neither in Brazil nor in Ecuador is there good evidence of the presence of more than one species (or subgenus). 4. The only species and genera that now seem to be clearly distinct among South American mastodonts are Cuvieronius hyodon, Haplomastodon waringi, and Stegomastodon platensis. All these names have numerous synonyms. The species Stegomastodon superbus and the genus and species Notiomastodon ornatus are also tentatively listed as distinct, but are of doubtful status. 5. Haplomastodon is believed to be about as closely related to Cuvieronius as to Stegomastodon. 6. All the South American mastodonts seem to represent end terms of divergence within a single broad stock. Cuvieronius, Stegomastodon, and probably also Haplomastodon were already differentiated before they spread from North America to South America. The North American Rhynchotherium may belong to the same complex. All may ultimately have arisen from early Old World Anancinae, and all are tentatively referred to that subfamily.

N2  - The anomuran sand crab family Albuneidae sensu stricto was previously known worldwide from 41 validly described Recent species in eight genera and four fossil taxa of the genus Albunea. A worldwide revision is presented based on a comprehensive survey of the literature and examination of more than 1700 specimens representing all known species. The state of taxonomic knowledge regarding the Albuneidae is summarized; the family is divided into two new subfamilies; two new genera and six new species of albuneids are described; and new information on species' ranges and biology is presented. Additionally, the genera Blepharipoda Randall and Lophomastix Benedict are removed from the Albuneidae and placed in a new family, based in part on characters of the gill formula and morphology. This new family contains six Recent species and one fossil taxon. Although there is some doubt about its hippoid affinities, it is retained in the Hippoidea as the most basal taxon, pending further cladistic phylogenetic analyses.

N2  - The present study examines the rhyparochromine tribe Myodochini at the generic level on a world basis. A key to 56 genera is provided and diagnoses and brief summary descriptions of salient morphological features are given for all genera. Thirteen new genera (Ashlockaria, Bacacephalus, Ereminellus, Froeschneria, Humilocoris, Megacholula, Neopamera, Paracholula, Paraparomius, Pseudoparomius, Slaterobius, Stalaria, and Stridulocoris) and the new species Megacholula englemani are described. The following new synonymies are made: Exptochiomera with Prytanes; Neocattarus with Cholula; Sphaerobius with Erlacda; and Sphaerobius gracilis with Erlacda arhaphaeoides. New combinations include: Ashlockaria sobrius; Bacacephalus globiceps; Cholula firmus, C. irrorandus, C. maculatus, C. parvus, C. vigens; Ereminellus arizonensis; Froeschneria infumatus, F. multispinus, F. oblitus, F. piligerus, F. vicinalis; Horridipamera bergrothi, H. ebenaui, H. inconspicuus, H. perlongus, H. pullatus, H. rusticus, H. spinicrus, H. subsericeus; Humilocoris cephalotes; Ligyrocoris occultus; Neopamera albocinctus, N. bilobata, N. brachialis, N. costalis, N. crassicornis, N. honduranus, N. insularis, N. intermedius, N. mumfordi, N. neotropicalis, N. paganus, N. platanus, N. procerulus, N. recinctus, N. serripes, N. sororculus, N. tineodes, N. tuberculatus, N. vicarius, N. vividus; Orthaea consuta, O. procinctus ; Pamerana punctulatus, P. scotti, P. sinae; Paracholula thoracicus, P. vegetus; Paraeucosmetus albofasciatus, P. crassiceps, P. gemmatus, P. harimaensis, P. malayus, P. mimulus, P. nervosus, P. sladeni, P. vitalisi, Paraparomius lateralis, P. leptopoides; Paromius limbatus; Prytanes albomaculata, P. caeca, P. confusa, P. dissimilis, P. foeda, P. formosa, P. fusicornis, P. intercisa, P. minima, P. oblonga, P. plebeius, P. tumens; Pseudopachybrachius basalis, P. capicolus, P. nesovinctus, P. pacificus, P. reductus, P. undulatus, P. vinctus; Pseudopamera ater, P. institius, P. setosa; Pseudoparomius linearis; Remaudiereana africana, R. andrewsi, R. annulipes, R. boninensis, R. castanea, R. flavipes, R. horvathi, R. inornatus, R. kydippe, R. nigra, R. nigriceps, R. noctuabundus, R. octonotata, R. puberulus, R. robustus, R. sidnicus, R. sobrina, R. tibialis; Slaterobius insignis, S. quadristriatus; Stalaria ferruginosus, S. kisseis, S. nysias; Stigmatonotum afrus, S. geniculatus; Stridulocoris gracilis. A cladistic analysis of the myodochine genera is presented with emphasis on the valuable character system of the male genitalia. Plesiomorphic and apomorphic states are designated for all characters employed, and only synapomorphic character states are employed to infer relationship and to construct a generic cladogram for the tribe Myodochini. The phylogeny shown in the cladogram is viewed against the current known distributions of the various living myodochine species and used to propose a broad zoogeographic hypothesis about the origins of the tribe and major monophyletic assemblages within the Myodochini. Almost total lack of transoceanic sister groups at the generic level suggests a post-Gondwanaland origin and evolution for the tribe, and the distributional patterns also attest to the isolated evolution of two major lineages in North America.

N2  - The cyprinodontiforms, or killifishes, are a large and diverse group of 900 fresh- and brackish-water species with a pantropical and temperate Laurasian distribution. Traditionally, it has been classified in five families: the worldwide, oviparous Cyprinodontidae, and four New World viviparous families: the Poeciliidae, Anablepidae, Jenynsiidae, and Goodeidae. Fishes of the diverse Cyprinodontidae, in turn, have been divided into as many as eight subfamilies. The objectives of the present study are to: (1) determine if the cyprinodontiform fishes as a whole form a monophyletic group; (2) determine if each of the five families is monophyletic; (3) define the major subgroups of cyprinodontiforms, concentrating on the genera of the Cyprinodontidae; (4) determine the interrelationships of the subgroups; (5) present a comprehensive classification of the cyprinodontiforms that reflects the interrelationships; and (6) provide a hypothesis for the distribution of the group. The following general results were obtained by using the methods of phylogenetic systematics and vicariance biogeography: (1) the cyprinodontiforms are considered to be monophyletic by their sharing derived characters of the caudal skeleton, upper jaw, gill arches, position of the first pleural rib, pectoral girdle, and aspects of breeding and development; (2) the family Cyprinodontidae is nonmonophyletic as it contains some of the most primitive and derived cyprinodontiforms; (3) each of the four viviparous families is monophyletic; however, their previous definitions in terms of uniquely derived characters have been altered; (4) the development of an annual habit, exhibited by members of the aplocheiloid killifishes and possibly some cyprinodontoids, includes derived reproductive traits exhibited to some degree by all killifishes; therefore, the annual habit does not define a monophyletic group of killifishes; (5) similarly, viviparity is not hypothesized to be a uniquely derived character, but has apparently arisen at least three times within the group; and (6) the interrelationships of cyprinodontiforms correspond, in part, with a pattern of the break-up of Pangea, except for an Andean-Eurasian sister group pair. A scheme of interrelationships of cyprinodontiforms as well as of monophyletic subgroups is presented in the form of cladograms, of which the former is transformed into a comprehensive classification of the group. The fishes under study are recognized as comprising the order Cyprinodontiformes Berg and divided into two suborders, the Aplocheiloidei (which previously comprised, in part, the Cyprinodontidae), and the Cyprinodontoidei (comprising all other cyprinodontiforms as well as the four viviparous families). In order to minimize the number of named empty categories, a numbering system is incorporated into a traditional naming system to create the new classification.

T1  - Marine bryozoans (Ectoprocta) of the Indian River area (Florida).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 173
SP  - 100
N2  - The distribution and ecology of marine bryozoans of the Indian River area on the east coast of Florida was studied through collections made at 21 stations over the course of a year. Bryozoans were identified from collections of all substrata (e.g., shells, hydroids, algae, rock, seagrasses) on which colonies might be able to grow. Eighty-four species of bryozoans have been obtained thus far from the waters of the Indian River region. All collections indicated that the availability of a suitable substratum is the chief factor governing distribution of bryozoan species. In the river the main substrata are the relatively short-lived blades of seagrasses on which small, rapidly growing bryozoan species are found. Eighteen species were found in the Indian River; 12 of them in waters of salinities less than 30% (estuarine conditions). Coastal stations, with more varied substrata available for settlement and with a wider range of microenvironmental conditions, were richer in species. Twenty-three species were found at Sebastian Inlet inner breakwater, 31 at North Beach breakwater, Fort Pierce, 36 at  Walton Rocks, and 31 at Seminole Shores. Offshore areas were also sampled. Twenty-one species were found at Capron Shoals. Twenty-eight species were identified in samples from two R/V Gosnold cruises. In the Indian River area some bryozoan reproduction occurred year-round, but many species reproduced primarily from late fall to early spring, in contrast to the late summer-early fall peak reproduction of bryozoan populations in temperate seas. Biogeographically, the species collected offshore had generally tropical affinities, whereas those collected at coastal and river stations included a number of tropical species, but also many species with broader Western Atlantic or cosmopolitam distributions.

T1  - Morphology and relationships of Apternodus and other extinct, zalambdodont, placental mammals.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 273
SP  - 1
N2  - We describe and illustrate new, middle Cenozoic fossils of dentally zalambdodont, North American placentals, including six relatively complete crania of Apternodus and two of Oligoryctes, as well as many partial skulls, mandibles, and teeth of these and other taxa. Several of the new Apternodus specimens are also associated with postcrania. We recognize seven species of Apternodus, three of which are new, formally propose the combination Oligoryctes altitalonidus, and recognize two other genera of small, North American, anatomically zalambdodont placentals, Parapternodus and Koniaryctes. We regard two other taxa previously associated with North American fossil zalambdodonts, one Bridgerian and the other Tiffanian, as valid but do not name them in this paper. In addition, we argue that dental zalambdodonty entails a primary occlusal relationship between the paracone and the ectoflexid, and the reduction or absence of the metacone and talonid basin. A phylogenetic analysis of cranial, dental, and postcranial characters of 30 fossil and Recent taxa leads us to conclude that (1) the Apternodontidae as defined in previous literature is not monophyletic and should be restricted to seven species of Apternodus, (2) the genus Oligoryctes contains at least two species and has a considerably longer geologic record than Apternodus, (3) neither Micropternodus nor currently known Paleocene taxa are closely related to Apternodus or Oligoryctes, and (4) a case can be made for a close relationship among modern soricids, Parapternodus, Koniaryctes, Oligoryctes and Apternodus to the exclusion of other insectivoran-grade taxa. With the use of ordered, multistate character transformations, Solenodon comprises the sister taxon to a soricid-fossil zalambdodont clade.

T1  - Higher-level relationships of the spider family Ctenidae (Araneae, Ctenoidea).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 274
SP  - 1
N2  - A cladistic analysis based on parsimony is undertaken to test hypotheses concerning the monophyly of the ctenid spiders and the relationships among their various clades. The data matrix comprised a total of 98 species representing 16 families scored for 146 characters, with all but six taken from various morphological systems; the remaining are behavioral attributes. Ctenidae is shown to be polyphyletic as currently delimited, but the most severely questioned taxa (i.e., Acanthoctenus, Cupiennius, and Ancylometes) are indeed members of this family. The so-called ctenid eye pattern is shown to be a synapomorphy uniting a more restricted set of taxa. This clade is recognized as Ctenidae sensu stricto and it comprises at least five major lineages: Acantheinae, Acanthocteninae, Calocteninae, Cteninae, and Viridasiinae. The latter taxa are hypothesized to be the sister group of all other ctenids. In turn, a clade formed by Miturgidae s.s. and Zoridae s.s. is proposed as the sister group of Ctenidae. The cladistic analysis also refutes the monophyly of Ctenus, Anahita, Enoploctenus, Celaetycheus, and Leptoctenus. The following taxonomic changes are proposed: Anahita isaloensis Ono, 1993 is transferred to Vulsor Simon, 1888; Diallomus Simon, 1897, currently placed in Zoridae, is transferred to Ctenidae; Tunabo Chamberlin, 1916 is synonymized with Neoctenus Simon, 1897; Neoctenus is removed from Zoridae and transferred to Trechaleidae; Xenoctenus Mello-Leitão, 1938 is removed from the synonymy of Tunabo and considered incertae sedis, within Ctenoidea.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 275
SP  - 1
N2  - Rhombomylus is a gliroid mammal endemic to several early Eocene localities of central and eastern Asia. It is best represented by a collection of numerous jaws and teeth, dozens of juvenile and adult skulls, and associated postcranial specimens from the early Eocene Yuhuangding Formation at the Dajian village, Junxian County, Hubei Province, China ... The core of the study consists of a taxonomic revision of the genus, a detailed description of the osteological morphology, extensive analyses on morphological characters, analyses on phylogeny, discussions on divergence time of the Glires, and analyses on functional morphology of mastication and locomotion. In comparing all known specimens assigned to the genus, we recognize only a single species, Rhombomylus turpanensis, for the genus and consider 'R. laianensis' a junior synonym ....

T1  - Phylogenetic studies on didelphid marsupials. 2, Nonmolecular data and new IRBP sequences : separate and combined analyses of didelphine relationships with denser taxon samplings.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 276
SP  - 1
N2  - In order to test the results of a previous study of didelphid marsupial phylogeny based on IRBP nuclear gene sequences (Jansa and Voss, 2000. Phylogenetic studies on didelphid marsupials I. Introduction and preliminary results from nuclear IRBP gene sequences. Journal of Mammalian Evolution 7: 43-77), we surveyed external, cranial, dental, and karyotypic characters among a more densely taxon-sampled didelphine ingroup. Separate maximum-parsimony analyses of these nonmolecular data and of a new (taxon-dense) IRBP matrix yielded superficially dissimilar strict-consensus topologies. However, no didelphine clade that was even moderately well supported by either separate analysis was contradicted by any equivalently well-supported clade in the other. Instead, all examples of taxonomic incongruence involved weak nodal support from one or both datasets. A maximum-likelihood analysis of the IRBP data produced a consensus topology that was completely congruent with, although slightly more resolved than, the maximum-parsimony consensus. A combined (simultaneous) maximum-parsimony analysis of both datasets (nonmolecular + IRBP) produced a consensus topology that closely resembled the results of analyzing IRBP separately. Most of the didelphine relationships previously reported by Jansa and Voss (op. cit.) are supported by these analytic exercises, with some notable exceptions. The taxon currently known as Marmosa canescens is conspicuously divergent from congeneric species and variously clusters with three different groups ('other Marmosa' + Micoureus, Monodelphis, or higher didelphines (= clade H of Jansa and Voss, op. cit.)) in several parsimony-equivalent resolutions of a fourfold basal polytomy in the IRBP and combined-data consensus topologies. Even without canescens, however, the genus Marmosa is not demonstrably monophyletic. The nomenclatural consequences of these results are discussed, and a new genus is described for 'Marmosa' canescens. Future analyses should test the monophyly of other speciose didelphine genera, but new sources of character data will be needed to offset the loss of resolution and decreased nodal support that are often caused by denser taxon sampling.

T1  - The spider subfamily Amaurobioidinae (Araneae, Anyphaenidae) : a phylogenetic revision at the generic level.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 277
SP  - 1
N2  - A cladistic phylogenetic analysis at generic level of the subfamily Amaurobioidinae is presented. The analysis is based on a dataset of 93 representative species scored for one behavioral and 199 morphological characters. Tree searches were made under equal and implied weights according to homoplasy, and the results were compared in terms of sensitivity to jackknife resampling. Mildest weighting functions produced trees more robust to resampling, and those results were selected as the working phylogenetic hypotheses. Groups of weak support as identified by jackknifing and Bremer indices are in general those that vary in resolution with different character-weighting schemes. Seven outgroup representatives were included (Malenella nana Ramírez, from Malenellinae, and six Anyphaeninae species). In this analysis Anyphaeninae, previously identified as sister group of Amaurobioidinae, is paraphyletic, but forcing its monophyly does not alter the groupings within Amaurobioidinae. The monophyly of the genera is in general well supported, but some particularly conflicting groups are discussed. In contrast, the relationships among genera are in general problematic. Amaurobioidinae is diagnosed by a pronounced indentation at the base of male palpal tegulum, and by a particular male copulatory bulb conformation, with a paramedian apophysis. The subfamily is classified in two tribes (Gayennini and Amaurobioidini); the genus Josa Keyserling, probably sister group to Gayennini, is not assigned to either tribe. The tribe Amaurobioidini is mainly diagnosed by an apical loop of the sperm duct in the male copulatory bulb. It includes 10 genera: Amaurobioides O.P.-Cambridge is restricted to seashores of southern continents. Clubiona chilensis Nicolet, transferred to Amaurobioides, is the first true record of the genus for South America. The male of Axyracrus elegans Simon, three species of Aysenia Tullgren, and three of Coptoprepes Simon are newly described. Four new genera are proposed in Amaurobioidini: Gamakia, Selknamia (described for one new species each), Aysenoides (for three new species), and Negayan (type species Gayenna tridentata Simon, including also Axyracrus coccineus Mello-Leitão, Clubiona paduana Karsch, Gayenna excepta Tullgren, Gayenna exigua Mello-Leitão, and Tomopisthes lebruni Simon). The previously revised genera Acanthoceto Mello-Leitão and Ferrieria Tullgren are also included in the tribe. The basal branch and most intergeneric branches of the tribe have low support values. Amaurobioides and Negayan, however, are relatively well supported. The tribe Gayennini is well defined by a homogeneous conformation of male and female genitalia, with a distinctive secondary conductor and spherical spermathecae. It includes 11 genera: Gayenna Nicolet includes only G. americana Nicolet from Chile and adjacent Argentina. Arachosia O.P.-Cambridge comprises many species previously assigned to Oxysoma. Abuzaida striata Keyserling, Anyphaena oblonga Keyserling, Gayenna proseni Mello-Leitão, Gayenna duplovittata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna bonneti Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma dubium Berland, Oxysoma bifasciatum Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma cubana Banks, Oxysoma polytrichium Mello-Leitão, Phidyle bergi Simon, and Samuza praesignis Keyserling are transferred to Arachosia. The males of Arachosia bergi (Simon), A. honesta Keyserling, and Arachosia praesignis (Keyserling) are newly described. Arachosia is easily recognized by the thick setae on the anterior lateral spinnerets, and it has good support values. A very diverse group of species here assigned to the genus Sanogasta Mello-Leitão is paraphyletic in terms of Arachosia. It includes many of the species formerly placed in Gayenna Nicolet. Anyphaena maculatipes Keyserling, Clubiona maculosa Nicolet, Gayenna paucilineata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna alticola Simon, Gayenna bonariensis Mello-Leitão, Gayenna rufithorax Tullgren, Gayenna x-signata Keyserling, Gayenna approximata Tullgren, Samuza minuta Keyserling, and Tomopisthes backhauseni Simon are transferred to Sanogasta. The female of Sanogasta alticola (Simon), the males of S. x-signata (Keyserling) and S. approximata (Tullgren), and four species are newly described. The males of Monapia carolina Ramírez and Monapia angusta (Mello-Leitão) are newly described. A new species of Oxysoma Nicolet from southern Brazil is described, and Gayenna saccata Tullgren is transferred to Oxysoma. Phidyle Simon is removed from the synonymy of Oxysoma Nicolet; the male of its only species Phidyle punctipes (Nicolet) is newly described. The genus Philisca Simon is redefined to include Liparotoma Simon. Clubiona tripunctata Nicolet and Clubiona gayi Nicolet are also transferred to Philisca. The male of Philisca hahni Simon and two species are newly described. The genus is reasonably supported, except for one basal species of questionable placement. Anyphaena punctata Keyserling, Gayenna fuscotaeniata Keyserling, Gayenna tripunctata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna reticulata Mello-Leitão, Gayenna taperae Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma quinquenotatum Simon, Oxysoma unipunctatum Simon, Oxysoma novum Mello-Leitão, Oxysoma lineatum Tullgren, and Tomopisthes frenatus Mello-Leitão are transferred to Tasata. The males of Tasata parcepunctata Simon, T. variolosa Mello-Leitão, and three species are newly described. Tasata albofasciata Mello-Leitão is transferred to Tupirinna Bonaldo, in the Corinnidae. Tomopisthes Simon includes only three species from Chile and adjacent Argentina. Clubiona horrenda Nicolet and Clubiona pusilla Nicolet are transferred to Tomopisthes. The male of Tomopisthes pusillus (Nicolet) is newly described. Two new genera are proposed in Gayennini: Araiya (Gayenna pallida Tullgren, type species and Gayenna coccinea Simon) and Gayennoides (for two new Chilean species). The genus Josa Keyserling, distinguished by a femoral apophysis on the male palp, is extremely diverse in Andean cloud forests and tropical America. It is one of the better supported groups of the analysis. Anyphaena keyserlingi L. Koch, Gayenna andesiana Berland, Gayenna simoni Berland, Gayennella riveti Berland, Haptisus nigrifrons Simon, Haptisus analis Simon, Haptisus maurus Simon, Olbophthalmus lojensis Berland, Olbus personatus Simon, Olbus gounellei Simon, Tetromma luteum Keyserling, and Tomopisthes chazaliae Simon are transferred to Josa. The male of Josa riveti (Berland) and one species are newly described. The following names are newly synonymized: Cluilius Simon, with Amaurobioides O.P.-Cambridge; Schiapellia Mello-Leitão, with Axyracrus Simon; Schiapellia gerschmanni Mello-Leitão and Amaurobioides boydi Forster, with Axyracrus elegans Simon; Tomopisthes magellanicus Simon and Gayenna strigosa Tullgren, with Clubiona (now Negayan) paduana Karsch; Tetromma Keyserling (preoccupied), Haptisus Simon, Olbophthalmus Simon, and Gayennella Berland, with Josa Keyserling; Anyphaena pilosa Keyserling and Gayenna riveti Berland, with Tetromma (now Josa) luteum Keyserling; Pelayo insignis Banks, with Haptisus (now Josa) nigrifrons Simon; Samuza Keyserling, Abuzaida Keyserling, and Gayennina Gertsch, with Arachosia O.P.-Cambridge; Tomopisthes tripunctatus Mello-Leitão, with Samuza (now Arachosia) praesignis Keyserling; Oxysoma ramboi Mello-Leitão, with Arachosia honesta Keyserling; Sanogasta intermedia Mello-Leitão, with Anyphaena (now Sanogasta) maculatipes Keyserling; Gayenna monticola Chamberlin, with Gayenna alticola Simon; Clubiona sternalis Nicolet, Anyphaena ignota Keyserling, Gayenna affinis Tullgren, Gayenna dubia Tullgren, Tomopisthes conspersus Simon, Tomopisthes modestus Simon, Tomopisthes taeniatus Simon, Gayenna skottsbergi Berland, and Tomopisthes injucundus Simon, with Clubiona (now Sanogasta) maculosa Nicolet; Tomopisthes kraepelini Simon, with Gayenna approximata Tullgren; Liparotoma Simon, with Philisca Simon; Philisca navarinensis Tullgren, with Philisca hahni Simon; Heteromma Karsch (preoccupied), with Tomopisthes Simon; Tomopisthes immanis Simon, Heteromma fuegiana Karsch, Philisca sica Strand, and Nonianus argentinus Mello-Leitão, with Clubiona (now Tomopisthes) horrenda Nicolet; Gayenna chilensis Tullgren, with Clubiona (now Tomopisthes) pusilla Nicolet; Gayenna stellata Simon, with Gayenna (now Araiya) coccinea Simon; Oxysoma punctipes Nicolet, Oxysoma aurata Nicolet, Oxysoma longipes Nicolet, Oxysoma lineata Nicolet, and Aporatea valdiviensis Simon, with Oxysoma punctatum Nicolet.

N2  - This study deals with the sister genera Chaetophloeus, new genus and Plocamocera Spinola of the checkered beetle subfamily Epiphloeinae. Chaetophloeus is monotypic and is described on the basis of C. hispidus, new species. Plocamocera is revised to include 35 species as follows: P. castanea, new species; P. pupula, new species; P. jayhawkalis, new species; P. confrater Kuwert; P. procera, new species; P. aliguantula, new species; P. minima, new species; P. manausensis, new species; P. coactilis, new species; P. sericella Spinola; P. auratilis, new species; P. argentea, new species; P. lucis, new species; P. sesquipedalis, new species; P. salasis, new species; P. iota, new species; P. prolixa, new species; P. quadrula, new species; P. baria, new species; P. aura, new species; P. buenavista, new species; P. taruma, new species; P. aspera, new species; P. paris, new species; P. bispina, new species; P. onorei, new species; P. carnegei, new species; P. santa, new species; P. sericellopsis, new species; P. insula, new species; P. ambra, new species; P. similis, new species; P. bolivari, new species; and P. selva, new species. A neotype is selected for P. sericella Spinola. Lectotypes are designated for P. confrater Kuwert and P. byssinus Erichson (junior synonym of P. sericella Spinola). Five new synonymies are recognized, they are P. confrater var similes Kuwert (junior synonym of P. confrater Kuwert), P. confrater var. sericelloides Kuwert (junior synonym of P. confrater Kuwert), P. impressicollis Pic (junior synonym of P. confrater Kuwert), Epiphloeus byssinus Erichson (junior synonym of P. sericella Spinola), and P. latefasciata Pic (junior synonym of P. sericella Spinola). Plocamocerans are diurnal, but are considerably active at night, highly cryptic on bark, when disturbed conduct flylike escape behavior, and are predators of lignicolous insects. The morphology of integumentary sensilla on the antenna, pronotum, and elytra are described, and SEM photographs of them is provided. Described for the first time are four types of antennal sensilla (one type of sensilla trichodea, two types of sensilla chaetica, and one type of sensilla basiconica), four pronotal trichobothria, and three types of pronotal sensilla trichodea, and on the elytra of Plocamocera confrater Kuwert eight trichobothria and two types of sensilla trichodea. It is postulated that filamentous sensilla trichodea on the antenna serve to perceive volatile tree trunk chemicals and/or aggregate pheromones of prey bark beetles. The study includes a review of trichobothrial function and distribution among insects. Morphological analysis is extended to include structure of the internal reproductive organs of some plocamoceran species. Also included are a discourse on species-level discontinuities; discussion of the specimen-study methods; methods for phylogenetic analysis; a treatise of evolutionary relationships based on Hennigian principles implemented in a data base analysis involving Farris's Hennig 86 which produced a computer-based phylogeny involving genera, species groups, and species; a list of specimen repositories (with e-mail addresses); key to species groups and species; table of character-state analysis; four color photographs; 20 SEM photographs; a total of 219 illustrations; 12 distribution maps; and one diagram of phylogeny that depicts a hypothesis of inter-and intrageneric evolutionary relationships. The 35 plocamoceran species are categorized into six species groups whose combined distribution extends from southern Mexico to southern Brazil. The members of the confrater and coactilis species groups are superficially very similar; their aedeagal structure and shape of antennomeres must be examined in detail for credible identifications at the species level. The sister group relationship between Chaetophloeus and Plocamocera is supported by the following four synapomorphies, they are pedicel very large, aedeagus lanceolate, male accessory glands reduced to two pairs, and metabasitarsomere one longer than metabasitarsomere two. Profuse distribution of bristlelike setae (chaetosomes) on the dorsum, forebody, and elytral disc and presence of moderately elongated sensilla trichodea on the antenna are autapomorphies for Chaetophloeus, whereas filamentous sensilla trichoidea on the antenna, boldly transverse pronotum, very robust metacoxa, very robust metafemora, presence of trichobothria on the epipleural margin, and sex dimorphism of abdominal color are synapomorphic character states that establish the monophyly of Plocamocera and define its ancestral basic plan. It is postulated that South America was the ancestral environs of Chaetophloeus and Plocamocera and that there were three independent northward extensions of major plocamoceran lineages into Central America.

T1  - New data on the skull and dentition in the Mongolian late Cretaceous eutherian mammal Zalambdalestes.

N2  - Exquisitely preserved specimens of the late Cretaceous eutherian Zalambdalestes recently collected from the Djadokhta Formation (early Campanian) of the Gobi Desert by the Mongolian Academy of Sciences-American Museum of Natural History Expeditions are the centerpiece of a thorough redescription of this taxon's craniodental morphology. Resolved and amended are uncertainties and errors in prior descriptions based on poorer preserved specimens collected by earlier expeditions to the Gobi. Preserved and described for the first time in Zalambdalestes is the basicranium, including an ectotympanic bone and portions of the hyoid arch. Zalambdalestes with a skull length of nearly 50 mm is large compared with other Cretaceous eutherians. It is also highly specialized with a long, thin, tubular snout, large diastemata in the anterior upper dentition, and an elongated mesial lower incisor with restricted enamel. These specializations, though less extreme, are also present in the zalambdalestids Barunlestes from the slightly younger Barun Goyot Formation of the Gobi and Kulbeckia from the late Turonian and Coniacian of Uzbekistan and the Santonian of Tadjikistan. No phylogenetic analysis published to date includes enough taxonomic and morphological breadth to evaluate the relationships of Zalambdalestes. Nevertheless, we investigate the impact of our observations on seven phylogenetic analyses published since 1993 that include Zalambdalestes. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis testing the relationships of Zalambdalestes is not included here, but it is expected to result from our ongoing efforts to produce a phylogeny of basal tribosphenic and therian mammals. Currently, zalambdalestids are viewed either as stem eutherians or as having affinities to Glires (lagomorphs and rodents). Our comparisons with other extinct and extant taxa support a position for Zalambdalestes within Eutheria but outside the crown-group Placentalia. Supporting this basal position for Zalambdalestes are such primitive features as the last upper incisor in the maxilla, nasals broadly expanded posteriorly to contact the lacrimals, pterygoids meeting on the midline, and the position of the glenoid fossa on the zygoma and not the braincase proper, in addition to the occurrence of epipubic bones reported previously. Zalambdalestes shares a number of apomorphies with Asioryctitheria, the clade including the Mongolian late Cretaceous Asioryctes, Ukhaatherium, and Kennalestes. Among the unusual specializations supporting a zalambdalestid-asioryctithere clade are: the postglenoid foramen anterior rather than posterior to the postglenoid process; the postglenoid and entoglenoid processes of the squamosal continuous; a fusiform ectotympanic expanded laterally and contacting the entoglenoid process; a suprameatal foramen in the squamosal; a crista interfenestralis connecting from the petrosal promontorium to a fingerlike tympanic process behind the round window; a large piriform fenestra in the anterior roof of the tympanic cavity, which transmitted the ramus inferior of the stapedial artery endocranially to the orbit; a foramen ovale between the alisphenoid and squamosal; and a medially positioned internal carotid artery. All but the last two of these specializations are reminiscent of those occurring in various extant lipotyphlans, including taxa placed by recent DNA sequence analyses within Afrotheria and Eulipotyphla, and may provide a link between the Mongolian Cretaceous eutherians and lipotyphlans. The available sample of Zalambdalestes exhibits a remarkable degree of individual variation, including the incidence of the upper maxillary incisor, the first upper premolar, and the second lower premolar. The possibility exists that more than a single species, Z. lechei, is represented.

T1  - Geology and paleontology of the Upper John Day beds, John Day River Valley, Oregon : lithostratigraphic and biochronologic revision in the Haystack Valley and Kimberly areas (Kimberly and Mt. Misery quadrangles).

N2  - The John Day Formation of north-central Oregon preserves a succession of speciose, superposed Oligocene through early Miocene mammalian faunas that establish the sequence of mid-Cenozoic mammalian evolution within the Pacific Northwest. Upper John Day rock units initially described by Merriam (1900, 1901) in the Kimberly and Haystack Valley areas were later divided into lower (Kimberly) and upper (Haystack Valley) members by Fisher and Rensberger (1972). We focused our study on the lithostratigraphic succession within the Haystack Valley Member. Rocks previously included in the Haystack Valley Member can be subdivided into four unconformity-bounded, genetic lithostratigraphic units that range in age from ~24 to ~18 Ma, three of the units incorporating age-diagnostic mammalian faunas. We have identified two principal depositional units within the Haystack Valley Member of Fisher and Rensberger south of Kimberly: (1) Johnson Canyon Member--late or latest Arikareean tuffaceous siltstones and fine sandstones (~?19-22.6 Ma) with fluvial monomictic intraformational pebble gravels, well exposed along the west wall of the John Day valley; (2) Rose Creek Member--coarse polymictic welded tuff-bearing gravels, debris flows, coarse obsidian-shard tuffs, and fine-grained tuffaceous units, yielding early Hemingfordian mammals (~18.2-18.8 Ma), deposited in angular unconformity on lower units of the John Day Formation along the east wall of the John Day valley. At Balm Creek in the type area of the Haystack Valley Member, the southern limb of the Balm Creek syncline exhibits the most complete local section of upper John Day rocks, here comprising three members: (1) a revised Haystack Valley Member made up of early late Arikareean ribbed tuffs (~23.5-23.8 Ma) with monomictic welded tuff conglomerate channels, overlain by a gray massive airfall marker tuff (GMAT); (2) Balm Creek Member--tuffaceous late Arikareean siltstones and fine sandstones interbedded with lacustrine tuffs, overlain by stacked fluvial fining-upward sequences and gray airfall tuffs; (3) Rose Creek Member--coarse polymictic welded tuff-bearing gravels, debris flows, lacustrine units, and fine-grained tuffaceous sediments, believed to correlate to the fossiliferous early Hemingfordian unit south of Kimberly. The complexity of upper John Day rocks (evidenced by marked lithofacies variation within multiple unconformity-bounded subunits, punctuated by numerous paleosols) suggests an early Miocene depositional regime with more varied local environments and pronounced episodic sedimentation relative to the more uniform Oligocene environments documented by lower John Day strata. Whereas the lower John Day Formation consists of fine-grained volcaniclastic sediments that were deposited in basins with minimal topographic relief, the upper John Day Formation is characterized by a succession of increasingly coarse fluvial channel fills, as well as compression appears to have triggered fluvial incision and valley filling from ~24 Ma to at least ~19 Ma. Extension in latest John Day times resulted in the development of half-grabens or grabens both in Haystack Valley and south of Kimberly, ensuring the preservation of upper John Day sediments. Significantly, a final episode of normal faulting appears to have immediately preceded the earliest eruption of Picture Gorge Basalt, as evidenced by flows of the Twickenham Member (PGBS) abutting against vertical fault scarps south of Kimberly. The faunas of the upper John Day units thus play a critical role in dating a complex sequence of tectonic events which preceded the onset of Columbia River Basalt Group flooding in the early Miocene.

T1  - Freshwater stingrays of the Green River Formation of Wyoming (early Eocene), with the description of a new genus and species and an analysis of its phylogenetic relationships (Chondrichthyes, Myliobatiformes).

N2  - Freshwater stingrays from the Fossil Butte Member of the late early Eocene Green River Formation of Wyoming are reviewed, and a new genus and species of fossil stingray is described. †Asterotrygon maloneyi, n.gen., n.sp. is remarkably well preserved and is known from articulated skeletons of juveniles and adults, both males and females. It is distinguished from all Recent and fossil stingrays, including  †Heliobatis radians from the same formation, by the unique presence of a dorsal fin covered with dermal denticles directly anterior to the caudal stings. Other characters that in combination distinguish the new fossil genus from all other stingrays include: retention of separate, individual vertebrae extending to the tail extremity instead of a cartilaginous rod posterior to caudal stings; dorsal surface of disc and tail covered by numerous, closely packed, minute denticles; tail relatively stout at base; and relative proportions of disc and tail. †Asterotrygon, n.gen. shares with certain stingray genera postorbital processes of neurocranium separated from a supraorbital process by a small notch in the supraorbital shelf, presence of both dorsal and ventral tail-folds posterior to caudal stings (and internally supported by rudimentary radial elements), and hyomandibulae separated from lower jaws by a gap that originally contained the hyomandibular-Meckelian ligament. A calcified angular cartilage between the hyomandibula and Meckel's cartilage is tentatively identified in †Asterotrygon, n.gen. as well. †Asterotrygon, n.gen. is unquestionably a stingray, presenting many myliobatiform synapomorphies including caudal stings on the dorsal aspect of tail, lack of jugal arches in neurocranium, a thoracolumbar synarcual cartilage posterior to scapulocoracoid, absence of thoracic ribs, and laterally expanded, shelflike postorbital processes. †Asterotrygon, n.gen. and †Heliobatis primitively retain a narrow and slightly arched puboischiadic girdle and primitively lack calcified rostral elements in adults. A phylogenetic analysis of 23 stingray genera, two outgroups, and 44 informative morphological characters resulted in 35 equally most parsimonious trees. The strict consensus reveals the following hierarchical structure: Hexatrygon + (†Asterotrygon, n.gen., Plesiobatis, Urolophidae + (Urotrygonidae + (†Heliobatis + (Potamotrygonidae + (amphi-American Himantura, Pteroplatytrygon, Himantura, Taeniura, Dasyatis + (Gymnuridae + Myliobatidae)))))). Our resulting tree has nodes in common with previous phylogenetic analyses of stingrays (e.g., Hexatrygon is the most basal stingray genus; gymnurids and myliobatids (pelagic stingrays) are well-supported sister-groups), but includes novel components, such as a clade that includes all dasyatid genera (as a polytomy) and the component Gymnuridae + Myliobatidae. 'Dasyatidae' is not monophyletic in any of the minimum-length trees obtained; Urolophidae (Urolophus and Trygonoptera) and Urotrygonidae (Urobatis and Urotrygon) are both monophyletic, but are not sister-groups. †Asterotrygon, n.gen. forms a clade with urolophids in 21 of the 35 equally most parsimonious trees. Successive approximations weighting adds only one additional node in relation to the strict consensus, which unites Pteroplatytrygon, Dasyatis, and Himantura sensu stricto (in a polytomy) with Gymnuridae + Myliobatidae. The resulting stingray phylogeny is at odds with previous phylogenies mostly regarding the affinities of amphi-American Himantura and Taeniura, which do not form a monophyletic group with the South American freshwater stingrays (Potamotrygonidae) in any of the minimum-length trees obtained. Similar to most elasmobranch groups, stingrays display much character conflict, and cladogram topologies are very sensitive to changes in character coding. Due to a high degree of character variation present in certain generic-level terminal taxa, a more fully representative species-level phylogeny is necessary to clarify the systematic importance of tail-fold configuration, ceratobranchial fusion patterns, and other characters discussed in our study. Three additional synapomorphies of stingrays were uncovered by our study, pertaining to the configuration of the basihyal, first pair of hypobranchial cartilages, and to the forward extension of the basibranchial copula. Our phylogenetic results imply the following biogeographic patterns: the relationships of †Asterotrygon, n.gen. demonstrate a strong Indo-west Pacific historical correlation, while †Heliobatis displays an affinity with the Americas; the node containing the greatest diversity of modern stingrays ('Dasyatidae' + (Gymnuridae + Myliobatidae)) evolved only after an American stingray lineage was established sometime earlier than the early Eocene; and potamotrygonids date at least from the late early Eocene, and not the Miocene, as previous studies have implied. The mechanism responsible for the invasion of the potamotrygonid ancestor into South America could indeed have been a marine transgression as advocated by other authors, albeit a much earlier (pre-Miocene) one, during either the late Cretaceous or the late Paleocene to early Eocene.

N2  - Charles Darwin commented that Ichthyornis, as one of the 'toothed birds' from the late Cretaceous of Kansas, offered some of 'the best support to the theory of evolution' (in litt., C. Darwin to O.C. Marsh, August 31, 1880). Ichthyornis figures no less prominently today. It is one of the closest outgroups to crown clade Aves, and remains one of the only Mesozoic avialans known from more than a handful of specimens. As such, Ichthyornis is an essential taxon for analyses of deep divergences within Aves because of its influence in determining the morphologies ancestral to the crown clade. Ichthyornis, however, has languished in need of new anatomical description and taxonomic revision. Many of the best Ichthyornis specimens were largely inaccessible, plastered into Yale Peabody Museum (YPM) exhibit mounts for nearly a century. The focus of this study was the entire YPM Ichthyornis collection, the largest at any institution. The elements removed from the mounts were identified to the specimens with which they were originally associated. Detailed morphological study of the 81 YPM specimens yielded the following results: (1) there is evidence for only one species of Ichthyornis, rather than the eight previously proposed; (2) 78 specimens are part of this species, Ichthyornis dispar; (3) two previously identified species are not part of Ichthyornis; and (4) one new species is identified. This analysis also provided a case study in the application of phylogenetic nomenclature at the species level. The morphology of Ichthyornis dispar is described in detail from the holotype and referred specimens. Phylogenetic analyses of 202 morphological characters, scored for 24 terminal taxa, evaluated the relationships among Mesozoic ornithurines including Ichthyornis dispar and the newly identified taxa. Analysis of 23 core taxa produced two most parsimonious trees (L: 384, CI: 0.66). Marsh's 'Ichthyornithiformes' is not monophyletic: Two previously named species of Ichthyornis as well as Apatornis celer are placed as more closely related to or as part of Aves. The results of the phylogenetic analyses have implications for previous hypotheses of the timing and pattern of the origin of Aves.

N2  - The sedimentary deposits of the New Jersey Coastal Plain span the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary and reveal a complex stratigraphy in the northeastern part of their outcrop belt. Newly discovered exposures of the New Egypt Formation in northeastern Monmouth County, New Jersey, indicate that a tongue of this formation, previously thought to be restricted in outcrop to southwestern Monmouth County, extends to the northeast. This formation is sandwiched between the Tinton Formation below and the Hornerstown Formation above. The upper contact is unconformable. Fossils occur in the upper part of the New Egypt Formation and the basal part of the Hornerstown Formation and are concentrated at the formational contact--this accumulation is known as the Main Fossiliferous Layer. The Discoscaphites minardi Assemblage Zone occurs in the New Egypt Formation approximately 2 m below the base of the Hornerstown Formation and contains Discoscaphites minardi Landman et al., 2004, Discoscaphites sp., Eubaculites carinatus (Morton, 1834), Eubaculites sp., and Eutrephoceras dekayi (Morton, 1834). Associated dinoflagellates include Deflandrea galatea (Lejeune-Carpentier, 1942) Lentin & Williams, 1973, and Thalassiphora pelagica (Eisenack, 1954) Eisenack & Gocht, 1960. The D. minardi Zone represents the middle part of the Upper Maastrichtian corresponding to the upper part of calcareous nannofossil Subzone CC26a and the lower part of Subzone CC26b. The Discoscaphites iris Assemblage Zone occurs at the top of the New Egypt Formation in an interval at least 20 cm thick and contains Discoscaphites iris (Conrad, 1858), Discoscaphites gulosus (Morton, 1834), D. minardi, Eubaculites latecarinatus (Brunnschweiler, 1966), E. carinatus, Sphenodiscus pleurisepta (Conrad, 1857), Sphenodiscus sp., and Eutrephoceras dekayi. Associated dinoflagellates include Palynodinium grallator Gocht, 1970, and T. pelagica. The D. iris Zone represents the uppermost Maastrichtian, corresponding to the upper part of calcareous nannofossil Zone CC26b. The basal beds of the Hornerstown Formation contain a mixed assemblage of Cretaceous and Paleocene fossils. Paleocene dinoflagellates include Carpatella cornuta Grigorovich, 1969, and Senoniasphaera inornata (Drugg, 1970) Stover & Evitt, 1978, and suggest that these beds correspond to planktonic foraminiferal zones PO-P[alpha]. There is no enrichment of iridium ([greater than or equal to]0.1 ppb) or layer of spherules at the formational contact but a dinoflagellate specimen with pockmarked damage consistent with melting is present in the top of the New Egypt Formation. The formational contact spans the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary but probably contains a hiatus of approximately 100 k.y. All of the Cretaceous fossils in the Main Fossiliferous Layer are reworked from the upper New Egypt Formation and reflect a period of erosion and winnowing, perhaps related to changes in sea level as well as events associated with the bolide impact at the end of the Cretaceous. Subsequently and simultaneously, the sea floor experienced extensive bioturbation, which may have further reworked fossils. Elsewhere on the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plain, the D. iris Zone also occurs immediately below the K/T boundary and is truncated by an erosional unconformity, commonly with reworked material in the overlying beds. The geographic distribution of the D. iris Zone and cores spanning the K/T boundary on the Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Plains help approximate the coastline of North America at that time and indicate a broad Mississippi embayment. However, there is no firm evidence that the Western Interior Seaway persisted until the end of the Cretaceous.

T1  - Braincase of the Upper Devonian shark Cladodoides wildungensis (Chondrichthyes, Elasmobranchii), with observations on the braincase in early chondrichthyans.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 288
SP  - 1
N2  - The braincase of an Upper Devonian shark (Cladodoides wildungensis) is investigated using high-resolution CT scanning, and its internal and external morphology is described from three-dimensional digital reconstructions. Many features are shared with modern elasmobranchs (neoselachians); these mostly represent conserved elasmobranch, chondrichthyan, or gnathostome characters. C. wildungensis resembles neoselachians in having a closed metotic fissure defining a glossopharyngeal canal, unlike some early chondrichthyans (e.g., Pucapampella, Orthacanthus) in which an open metotic fissure extends a considerable distance beneath the otic capsule. However, the glossopharyngeal canal in C. wildungensis is connected to a persistent dorsal fissure between the occipital arch and otic capsules, whereas this fissure becomes closed during neoselachian ontogeny. The embryonic polar cartilage apparently made a much greater contribution to the basicranium than in neoselachians and gnathostomes generally. This has affected the position of the efferent pseudobranchial foramen and the location of the orbital articulation in Cladodoides (both of which are located anteriorly in the orbit), as well as the size and extent of the dorsum sellae and the hypophyseal chamber inside the braincase. Another unusual feature in Cladodoides is the postorbital position of its trigeminal and facial nerves; instead of being situated in a trigemino-facial fossa of the orbit as in neoselachians, their foramina are located behind the postorbital process, although the pituitary vein and the origin of the external rectus eye muscle (located within the trigemino-facial fossa in neoselachians) both lie in the posterior part of the orbit. The oblique orientation of the postorbital arcade (derived from the embryonic lateral commissure) may be related to the exclusion of the trigeminal and facial nerves from the orbit. A laterally oriented canal through the process probably contained the trigeminal maxillary ramus (perhaps accompanied by the buccal ramus of the anterodorsal lateral line nerve). By contrast, in neoselachians these rami pass directly into the orbit (sometimes forming a buccal-maxillary complex), but they do not pass through the postorbital process. The Cladodoides braincase probably represents a juvenile or submature individual and shows indications of incomplete development (e.g., presence of a wide buccohypophyseal fenestra and absence of a precarotid commissure; incomplete enclosure of the internal carotids and orbital arteries by basicranial cartilage; incomplete closure of the braincase roof along the dorsal midline). The braincase also lacks multiple-layered prismatic calcification, possibly representing another juvenile feature. The phylogenetic relationship of Cladodoides wildungensis is discussed. Dental, postcranial, and cranial features lend some support to the old hypothesis that cladodont sharks form a monophyletic group. While such a view is at variance with several recently published phylogenetic analyses, many of the characters noted in the present work have yet to be tested within a rigorous cladistic framework, and their phylogenetic significance is uncertain.

N2  - The external morphology of the adult, egg, larva, and pupa of Agathidium oniscoides Beauvois is described. The natural history of the genus is reviewed, including associations with Myxomycetes and fungi and techniques for field collection and laboratory study. The phylogenetic species concept is discussed and applied in this study. A key and brief diagnoses are provided for the genera of Agathidiini (Coleoptera: Leiodidae: Leiodinae) of North and Central America. Volvoxis Kugelann is regarded as a nomen oblitum, and its junior synonym Agathidium Panzer is regarded as the valid name (nomen protectum) for this taxon by invoking article 23.9 of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. A key to species groups of Agathidium Panzer is presented. Species are revised for the A. sexstriatum, A. brevisternum, and A. revolvens species groups, including keys, diagnoses, descriptions, and figures of important morphological features. Lectotypes are designated for A. bistriatum Horn and A. sexstriatum Horn. The following new species are described: A. angustoperculum, n.sp., A. dioperculum, n.sp., A. dubitanoides, n.sp., A. falcatoperculum, n.sp., and A. rhinocerellum, n.sp..

Lectotypes have been designated for A. inconstans, A. leucomelas, A. nitidus, and A. immarginatus, and for the junior synonyms Clerus laevigatus Spinola, C. mollifascia Chevrolat (new synonymy), C. subfasciatus (Chevrolat), and C. cyaneus (Chevrolat) (new synonymy, new combination; transferred from Enoclerus Gahan). Aside from the conventional subject categories of generic revisions, this work also includes a translation of the abstract into Spanish, a treatise about natural history, discussions of species groups and troublesome key couplets, and evolutionary considerations involving phylogeny and zoogeography. There are 28 habitus illustrations, 239 line drawings, 29 distribution maps, 9 maps depicting the distribution of the major New World clerofauna, 13 electron micrographs, 5 photographs, 1 phylogenetic tree generated by the Hennig 86 computer program, a table involving character analysis, and a table depicting the geographical distribution of the apheloceran species groups. Members of the genus Aphelocerus are thought to be involved in a mimetic complex that also includes species of ants, buprestids, and chrysomelid beetles, weevils, and spiders. These checkered beetles have been observed to scurry on broad-leafed herbaceous plants, and particularly along leaf stems, often in the company of black ants of approximately the same size. A few have been observed foraging on a variety of tree canopy blossoms, although it is not known whether the clerids were consuming anthophilic insects or taking nourishment from flower products such as nectar or pollen. Specimens have been collected throughout the year; however, most were captured from May to July, at elevations ranging from 97 to 3000 m. The 'beating sheet' method of collecting seems to be the most productive manner of gathering these beetles, although specimens have been collected with an aspirator while the insect was scurrying on foliage or bark (fig. 1b). Other collecting techniques that yielded specimens include the use of sweep nets, light traps, and Malaise traps. A few specimens were aspirated from flowers of forest trees. It is postulated that the initial division of ancestral Aphelocerus occurred on the current land mass geologically formed by the union of the Mexican/Mayan blocks. The evolution of the group probably began some time after the major Caribbean tectonic events had taken place. The relative paucity of structural diversity among the extant members of the genus suggests a recent evolution for the group or strong selection to resemble a common model for mimicry. The available evidence indicates that there have been three major evolutionary trends among the extant species of Aphelocerus. The first involves the progressive increase of elytral convexityamong the mimetic species of the genus, i.e., mimicry of ants, spiders, and Myrmex weevils. The second trend involves the development of white secondary (28) setae on the elytra, and third, the consolidation of these setae into white setal patches on various organs of the integument. The prominent association of checkered beetles with temperate and tropical montane regions suggests that checkered beetles, in general, occur in seven New World geographical areas, each of which is illustrated: North America, Middle America, South America, Mexo America, Central America, nuclear Central America, and insular Central America.

T1  - Systematic review of the frog family Hylidae, with special reference to Hylinae : phylogenetic analysis and taxonomic revision.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 294
SP  - 1
N2  - Hylidae is a large family of American, Australopapuan, and temperate Eurasian treefrogs of approximately 870 known species, divided among four subfamilies. Although some groups of Hylidae have been addressed phylogenetically, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis has never been presented. The first goal of this paper is to review the current state of hylid systematics. We focus on the very large subfamily Hylinae (590 species), evaluate the monophyly of named taxa, and examine the evidential basis of the existing taxonomy. The second objective is to perform a phylogenetic analysis using mostly DNA sequence data in order to (1) test the monophyly of the Hylidae; (2) determine its constituent taxa, with special attention to the genera and species groups which form the subfamily Hylinae, and c) propose a new, monophyletic taxonomy consistent with the hypothesized relationships. We present a phylogenetic analysis of hylid frogs based on 276 terminals, including 228 hylids and 48 outgroup taxa. Included are exemplars of all but 1 of the 41 genera of Hylidae (of all four nominal subfamilies) and 39 of the 41 currently recognized species groups of the species-rich genus Hyla. The included taxa allowed us to test the monophyly of 24 of the 35 nonmonotypic genera and 25 species groups of Hyla. The phylogenetic analysis includes approximately 5100 base pairs from four mitochondrial (12S, tRNA valine, 16S, and cytochrome b) and five nuclear genes (rhodopsin, tyrosinase, RAG-1, seventh in absentia, and 28S), and a small data set from foot musculature. Concurring with previous studies, the present analysis indicates that Hemiphractinae are not related to the other three hylid subfamilies. It is therefore removed from the family and tentatively considered a subfamily of the paraphyletic Leptodactylidae. Hylidae is now restricted to Hylinae, Pelodryadinae, and Phyllomedusinae. Our results support a sister-group relationship between Pelodryadinae and Phyllomedusinae, which together form the sister taxon of Hylinae. Agalychnis, Phyllomedusa, Litoria, Hyla, Osteocephalus, Phrynohyas, Ptychohyla, Scinax, Smilisca, and Trachycephalus are not monophyletic. Within Hyla, the H. albomarginata, H. albopunctata, H. arborea, H. boans, H. cinerea, H. eximia, H. geographica, H. granosa, H. microcephala, H. miotympanum, H. tuberculosa, and H. versicolor groups are also demonstrably nonmonophyletic. Hylinae is composed of four major clades. The first of these includes the Andean stream-breeding Hyla, Aplastodiscus, all gladiator frogs, and a tepuian clade. The second clade is composed of the 30-chromosome Hyla, Lysapsus, Pseudis, Scarthyla, Scinax (including the H. uruguaya group), Sphaenorhynchus, and Xenohyla. The third major clade is composed of Nyctimantis, Phrynohyas, Phyllodytes, and all South American/West Indian casque-headed frogs: Aparasphenodon, Argenteohyla, Corythomantis, Osteocephalus, Osteopilus, Tepuihyla, and Trachycephalus. The fourth major clade is composed of most of the Middle American/Holarctic species groups of Hyla and the genera Acris, Anotheca, Duellmanohyla, Plectrohyla, Pseudacris, Ptychohyla, Pternohyla, Smilisca, and Triprion. A new monophyletic taxonomy mirroring these results is presented where Hylinae is divided into four tribes. Of the species currently in 'Hyla', 297 of the 353 species are placed in 15 genera; of these, 4 are currently recognized, 4 are resurrected names, and 7 are new. Hyla is restricted to H. femoralis and the H. arborea, H. cinerea, H. eximia, and H. versicolor groups, whose contents are redefined. Phrynohyas is placed in the synonymy of Trachycephalus, and Pternohyla is placed in the synonymy of Smilisca. The genus Dendropsophus is resurrected to include all former species of Hyla known or suspected to have 30 chromosomes. Exerodonta is resurrected to include the former Hyla sumichrasti group and some members of the former H. miotympanum group. Hyloscirtus is resurrected for the former Hyla armata, H. bogotensis, and H. larinopygion groups. Hypsiboas is resurrected to include several species groups - many of them redefined here - of gladiator frogs. The former Hyla albofrenata and H. albosignata complexes of the H. albomarginata group are included in Aplastodiscus. New generic names are erected for (1) Agalychnis calcarifer and A. craspedopus; (2) Osteocephalus langsdorffii; the (3) Hyla aromatica, (4) H. bromeliacia, (5) H. godmani, (6) H. mixomaculata, (7) H. taeniopus, (8) and H. tuberculosa groups; (9) the clade composed of the H. pictipes and H. pseudopuma groups; and (10) a clade composed of the H. circumdata, H. claresignata, H. martinsi, and H. pseudopseudis groups.

VL  - 268
SP  - 1
N2  - The subfamily Diapriinae (Diapriidae: Proctotrupoidea) in the New World is reviewed at the supra specific level. Three tribes and 52 genera are recognized. Sixteen new genera are proposed: Apopria (Diapriini), Avoca (Diapriini), Chilomicrus (Spilomicrini), Cruzium (Diapriini), Doddius (Spilomicrini), Eladio (Diapriini), Epomium (Spilomicrini), Ferrugenus (Spilomicrini), Hansona (Diapriini), Leucopria (Diapriini), Mimopriella (Diapriini), Omopria (Diapriini), Ortona (Psilini), Peckidium (incertae sedis) Psychopria (Diapriini), and Turripria (Diapriini). The following new species are described: Apopria coveri [female] (USA), Asolenopsia gibba [female] (Costa Rica), Avoca collaris [female] (USA), Chilomicrus pecki [male] (Chile), Cruzium amphorale [female] (Costa Rica), Eladio cruzi [female] (Costa Rica), Epomium cicatrix [female] (Chile), Ferrugenus chilensis [female] (Chile), Hansona pauli [female] (Costa Rica), Leucopria cylindricornis [female] (Ecuador, Costa Rica), Omopria brevipalpis [female] (Brazil), Ortona hansoni [female] (Costa Rica), Peckidium enigmaticum [female] (Antilles, Central and South America, West Africa, Philippines), Psychopria hoguei [male] (Costa Rica), Turripria woldai [female] (Panama). New generic synonymies are proposed: Acanthopria Ashmead (= Adelioneiva Fischer), Asolenopria Kieffer (= Euplacopria Ferrière), Bruchopria Kieffer (= Aulatopria Brèthes), Doliopria Kieffer (= Martinica Risbec), Megaplastopria Ashmead (= Xyalopria Kieffer), Notoxoides Ashmead (= Psilogasteroides Brèthes), Pentapria Kieffer (= Antipapria Fabritius, Bakeria Kieffer, Plutopria Kieffer, Spilomicrinus Ogloblin), Spilomicrus Westwood (= Hoplopria Ashmead, Linkiola Kieffer), Szelenyiopria Fabritius (= Gymnopria Loiácono). New combinations are proposed: Aulatopria tucumana Brèthes to Bruchopria, Bakeria rugosa Dodd to Doddius, Gymnopria lucens Loiácono to Szelenyiopria, Mimopria pentatoma Borgmeier and Mimopria splendens Borgmeier to Mimopriella, and Xanthopria nitida Brues to Acanthopria. The 52 genera are keyed (keys in both English and Spanish); for each genus the synonymies, diagnoses, descriptions, recognition and relationships, distribution, and biology are given. Twelve plates with 107 figures are included.

T1  - Northern Adriatic Bryozoa from the vicinity of Rovinj, Croatia.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 270
SP  - 1
N2  - One hundred six species of Bryozoa collected from the northern Adriatic in the vicinity of Rovinj, Croatia, are distributed among the orders Ctenostomata (8 species), Cheilostomata (79 species), and Cyclostomata (19 species). Ctenostomes are underrepresented in the collections relative to the two orders with calcified colonies. Five of the cheilostome species are new: Hagiosynodos hadros n. sp., Schizomavella subsolana n. sp., Cellepora adriatica n. sp., Celleporina siphuncula n. sp., and Rhynchozoon revelatus n. sp. (previously referred to as Rhynchozoon sp. II Hayward). Seven species named by Heller (1867) are stabilized by selection of lectotypes (Beania hirtissima, Adeonella pallasii, Hagiosynodos kirchenpaueri, Exidmonea triforis, Crisia recurva) and neotypes (Mollia circumcincta, Schizomavella cornuta) from Heller's collection in the University of Innsbruck Institute of Zoology. Lectotypes are designated for the Adriatic species Hippoporina lineolifera (Hincks, 1886) and for Schizomavella mamillata (Hincks, 1880). Beania cylindrica (Hincks, 1886) and Schizoporella asymetrica (Calvet, 1927) are recognized as species rather than as subspecific units. The species-rich cheilostome genus Schizoporella Hincks, 1877, which contains some of the most widely known fouling bryozoans, is designated a nomen protectum. The species name Smittina cheilostoma (Manzoni, 1869) is preserved as established usage.

T1  - A revision of the Australasian ground spiders of the families Ammoxenidae, Cithaeronidae, Gallieniellidae, and Trochanteriidae (Araneae, Gnaphosoidea).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 271
SP  - 1
N2  - The Australasian ground spiders belonging to the 'lower gnaphosoid' families (i.e., those gnaphosoids that retain a plesiomorphic, complete distal article on the anterior lateral spinnerets) are monographed. The families Ammoxenidae and Cithaeronidae are newly recorded from Australia, and the Australian fauna of the family Gallieniellidae is documented for the first time. Australia is thus the only continent known to house members of all seven currently recognized gnaphosoid families. Ammoxenids, previously known only from southern Africa, are represented in Australia by the new genera Austrammo (described for four new species) and Barrowammo (described for one new species). Cithaeronids are represented by the widespread type species, Cithaeron praedonius O.P.-Cambridge, newly recorded from the Northern Territory. The Australian gallieniellid fauna consists of five genera: Meedo Main, here transferred from the Clubionidae, and four new genera: Neato (described for seven new species), Oreo (described for six new species), and Peeto and Questo (each described for one new species). The male of Meedo houstoni Main is described for the first time, as are 12 new species of that genus. The world trochanteriid fauna consists of 18 genera, of which 15 occur in Australasia; the 18 genera are newly assigned to subfamilies (the relimited Trochanteriinae plus the new subfamilies Trachycosminae and Morebilinae). Within the Trochanteriinae, Corimaethes Simon is newly synonymized with Platyoides O.P.-Cambridge, and its Western Australian type species, C. campestratus Simon, is placed as a junior synonym of the African species P. walteri (Karsch); the species is presumed to have been introduced into Australia prior to 1905 but seems not to have become established. The genus Olin Deeleman-Reinhold, recently described for a species from Sulawesi, is newly recorded from an Australian Indian Ocean territory, Christmas Island. The new genera Tinytrema and Desognaphosa are described for five and 26 new species, respectively. Tinytrema is known only from Australia (including Tasmania); Desognaphosa species occur primarily in northern Queensland, but one extends into New South Wales and one is described from the Solomon Islands. The subfamily Trachycosminae includes the Australian genera Trachycosmus Simon and Trachytrema Simon, both newly transferred from the Gnaphosidae, plus the new genus Trachyspina (described for seven new species). The male of Trachytrema castaneum Simon is newly described, as are one new species of that genus and three of Trachycosmus. The subfamily Morebilinae includes four described and four new genera. Hemicloeina Simon and Pyrnus Simon are transferred to the Morebilinae from the Gnaphosidae, and Fissarena Henschel, Davies, and Dickman is transferred from the Liocranidae. Hemicloea plagusia (Walckenaer), H. fumosa L. Koch, H. cineracea L. Koch, Rebilus diversus (L. Koch), R. praesignus (L. Koch), and R. swarbrecki Dunn and Dunn are transferred to the new genus Morebilus; M. cineraceus and M. praesignis are placed as junior synonyms of M. fumosus and M. diversus, respectively; and nine new species of Morebilus are described. Hemicloea insidiosa Simon is transferred to the new genus Longrita, its male is described for the first time, and eight new species of Longrita are described. Hemicloea plana L. Koch and Rebilus obscurus Berland are transferred to Pyrnus; six new species of Pyrnus are described from Australia, Lord Howe Island, and New Caledonia. Pyrnus flavitarsis (L. Koch) is transferred to the new genus Platorish, its male is described for the first time, and four new species of Platorish are described. Rebilus castaneus Simon and Hemicloea longipes Hogg are transferred to Fissarena, and the male of the former species is described for the first time, as are six new species of Fissarena and 16 new species of Rebilus Simon (which is newly assigned to the Morebilinae). The genus Boolathana is described for two new species from Western Australia. Adults of Hemicloeina somersetensis (Thorell) are described for the first time, and seven new species from Australia and New Guinea are assigned to Hemicloeina. The lamponid generic name Centrina Platnick is preoccupied and is replaced by Centroina. A supplement adds new records for many species, as well as descriptions of the new species Trachyspina daunton and Longrita nathan and of the first known male of Morebilus blackdown, new species.

T1  - A revision of the Turonian members of the ammonite subfamily Collignoniceratinae from the United States Western Interior and Gulf Coast.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 267
SP  - 1
N2  - The Collignoniceratinae of the U.S. Western Interior first appear in the Lower Turonian and range through the Middle, and most of the upper, Turonian. For most of their range they are important biostratigraphic indicators. A review of their biostratigraphic distribution is provided and this is followed by a revision and/or discussion of the following taxa: Cibolaites molenaari Cobban and Hook, 1983, Collignoniceras woollgari woollgari (Mantell, 1822), C. woollgari regulare Haas, 1946, C. vermilionense (Meek and Hayden, 1860), C. jorgenseni n. sp., C. percarinatum (Hall and Meek, 1856), C. praecox (Haas, 1946), Collignonicerites collisniger n. gen., n. sp., Prionocyclus hyatti (Stanton, 1894), P. albinus (Fritsch, 1872), P. macombi Meek, 1876, P. bosquensis Kennedy, 1988, P. wyomingensis Meek, 1876, P. novimexicanus (Marcou, 1858), P. quadratus Cobban, 1953, P. germari (Reuss, 1845), P. pluricostatus n. sp., Prionocyclites mite Kennedy, 1988, and Reesidites minimus Hayasaka and Fukada, 1951. Collignoniceras woollgari, Prionocyclus hyatti, P. macombi, P. wyomingensis, P. novimexicanus, P. quadratus, and P. germari have been designated as zonal species in many publications, but aside from C. woollgari, P. hyatti, and P. wyomingensis,most of these species have not been well described in terms of their intraspecific variation. In many species, there is a gracile and a robust form, which may represent sexual dimorphs, but in most instances, the sample size of adult specimens is too small to prove this.

T1  - Revision of New World Plagiognathus Fieber : with comments on the Palearctic fauna and the description of a new genus (Heteroptera, Miridae, Phylinae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 266
SP  - 1
N2  - The diagnostic features of Plagiognathus are clarified, with characteristics of the male genitalia being used for the first time in diagnosing the Nearctic species. The North American species are revised, with a total of 86 native and 3 introduced species being recognized. Twenty-four species are described as new. Habitus, vesical, and antennae illustrations are provided for all of these species. The Palearctic fauna is discussed; vesical illustrations are provided for 10 of the 24 species placed in Plagiognathus in the most recent catalog. Twenty-five new synonymies are created. Twenty-five species are transferred into Plagiognathus from other genera or removed from Plagiognathus and placed in other genera; in addition to the new combinations with definitive generic placement, 16 species are treated as incertae sedis. Microphylellus Reuter, Chaetophylidea Knight, and Parapsallus Wagner are treated as junior synonyms of Plagiognathus. Plagiognathus reuterellus, new name, is proposed to replace Plagiognathus flavipes Reuter, 1875, a junior secondary homonym. Six neotypes and one lectotype are designated in an effort to ensure stability in the application of names within Plagiognathus. A new genus, Tuxedo, with Microphylellus bicinctus Van Duzee, as the type species, is described to accommodate five previously described taxa that do not belong to either Microphylellus or Plagiognathus, in which genera they were originally placed. The generic-group name Zophocnemis Kerzhner is elevated to generic status to accommodate its single included species, bicolor Jakolev, because that species does not fit the revised diagnosis for Plagiognathus. Myochroocoris Reuter is synonymized with Atractotomus Fieber, its single included species, griseolus Reuter from eastern North America, having all of the diagnostic characters of Atractotomus. Specimens were broadly sampled from North American museums, with particular attention paid to the fauna west of the Great Plains. The eastern North American fauna is, nonetheless, treated in detail with the most extensive attempt yet to deal with the fauna of the South. Many new host records are included, clarifying associations for some species, but still leaving the breeding habits of others in question.

The taxa recognized are: M. anchietae (including quadriscutata, okavangensis, devisi), leonhardi (including vernayi), c. capensis (including decosteri), c. rhodesianus new subspecies, zambezensis, s. sphenorhynchus (including habenichti, gazei), s. mauricei new combination (including ocularis), kabindae, perplexus, remaclei, adercae, scalper (including gerardi, bulsi), vanderysti (including lujae, vilhenai, closei), luandae; D. welwitschii, angolensis, ellenbergeri, gigantea (including truncata), longicauda, pistillum (including granti, colobura, jallae, transvaalensis, mossambica, kuanyamarum), luluae new combination. Geographic variation is mapped for widely ranging forms and ontogenetic changes in cephalic keratinization are documented. The review is based on some 1500 specimens, many of them collected as part of the project. All extant types have been reexamined. The present paper also summarizes ecological information gained from collectors, and miscellaneous biological data scattered throughout the literature, and includes an analysis of stomach contents for those species well represented in the Umtali collection.

N2  - The known North American Herpyllus (25 species) and Scotophaeus (one species) are diagnosed, described, and assigned to species groups. The synonymy of the predominantly European genus Scotophaeus with Herpyllus is disclaimed; the Mexican genus Bonna O.P.-Cambridge is newly synonymized with Herpyllus. A single European species of Scotophaeus, S. blackwalli (Thorell), is represented in the New World by three isolated and apparently introduced synanthropic populations. Eight new species of Herpyllus (sherus, frio, iguala, gertschi, perote, malkini, brachet, and giganteus) are described from the southwestern United States and Mexico. Six specific names are newly synonymized: H. cratus Chamberlin with H. ecclesiasticus Hentz; H. piedicus Chamberlin and Woodbury with H. propinquus (Keyserling); H. cepeus Chamberlin with H. cockerelli (Banks); and H. bryophilus Chamberlin, H. itamus Chamberlin, and H. faxoni Bryant, all with H. emertoni Bryant. The female of H. bensonae Fox and the males of H. excelsus Fox, H. reservatus Chamberlin, H. pictus (F.O.P.-Cambridge), H. schwarzi (Banks), H. bubulcus Chamberlin, and H. regnans Chamberlin are described for the first time. Herpyllus atopophysis Chamberlin and H. floridanus (Banks) are transferred to Nodocion; H. irvingi Mello-Leitão and H. josephus (Chamberlin and Gertsch) are transferred to Cesonia.

N2  - Two genera of redfieldiid fishes, Redfieldius (Redfield) and Dictyopyge Lyell, are completely described and adequately diagnosed for the first time since their discovery more than a century ago. The number of Redfieldius species is reduced from seven to one -- R. gracilis. Two species of Dictyopyge are recognized, D. macrurus (Redfield) and a new species, D. meekeri, on the basis of meristic characters. According to recent palynological and paleobotanical evidence, the rocks of the Newark Supergroup containing Redfieldius are Liassic in age and those including Dictyopyge are Upper Triassic. The presence of other redfieldiids in the Newark Supergroup, first described from rocks of similar age in the western United States, is briefly mentioned. The geologic occurrence of fishes in the Newark Supergroup is discussed and a correlation chart for the major basins is included.

T1  - A comparative analysis of acoustical signals in pied woodpeckers (Aves, Picoides).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 160
SP  - 1
N2  - The avian genus Picoides with 33 species is the largest of the nearly worldwide family of woodpeckers (Picidae). Picoides is the subject of vocal analysis involving field, literature, and audiospectrographic studies. Analyzable data were available for two-thirds of the species. The analyses were conducted using quantitative and qualitative techniques, in a manner attempting isolation of descriptive, functional, motivational, and homologous aspects of acoustical signal communication. Vocalizations include Call Notes, Scolding Call, Double Call, Rattle Call, Short Rattle Call, Mistle Thrush Call, Mutter Call, Kweek Call, Wicka Call, Twitter Call, Wad Call, Soft Notes, Distress Trill, Chirp Call, Loud Chirp Call, Squeak Call, Screech Call, and Distress Cry, and there are several instrumental signals (Drumming, Tapping, Wing Rustling). These are described and many are illustrated sonagraphically for species represented by tape-recordings. Summaries are provided for all vocal and instrumental signals that have several or more species represented. Most sounds made by these woodpeckers are formed of three major elements: clicking, squeaking, and ascending sounds. When further data become available, these elements may provide a productive means of analyzing the vocalizations. Aspects of the repertoire briefly discussed are the number and quality of calls, their discreteness, overall tendencies in structure, relative frequency of different calls, and combinations. Each major acoustical signal is discussed functionally, in terms of its 'meaning' and the biological advantages it affords. The array of such signals includes calls that may overlap in function, but differ in occurrence, the distance at which they are effective, and other parameters. Drumming and the Rattle Call are the most important long-distance signals. Call Notes chiefly are contact calls. Rattle Calls function in territorial announcement and defense, but may serve as a contact call in some species. Sexual interactions of various kinds are accompanied by Kweek Calls, with special functions in P. medius and P. borealis. Wicka, Mutter, and Twitter calls mark encounters between individuals and often accompany visual displays. Wad Calls commonly occur between members of a pair. Various nestling and fledgling calls are ascribed functions. Drumming has diverse and often subtle functions, and may differ in structure and function seasonally. It differs from most avian signals in communicating over a distance, aspects of environmental features, e.g., the occurrence of suitable trees for Drumming or nesting. Motivation of the signals is discussed in a framework based on a general arousal scheme and dominance behavior that is directly equivalent to 'aggressive' behavior ethologically. The Call Note indicates arousal, Scolding -- alarm, and Rattle Calls -- aggression, in this context. Kweek Calls of one type usually are submissive; those of another, as well as Wicka Calls, are aggressive. Conflicts between fleeing and aggression find expression in the Mutter and the Twitter Calls, and between aggression and submission in the Wad Call. Hunger, the motivation to flee, or to stay in place usually seem involved in the Squeak Call. Drumming seems related to a special category of motivation with a low threshold that may be elicited by extraneous noises or the presence of a Drumming substrate. An attempt is made to ascribe likely meanings to the signals, based on their information content. Call Notes indicated the location of the sender, and particularly are noted with changes in position. The Rattle Call is self-assertive or aggressive and transmits that information plus the location of the signaler. Scolding and Short Rattle Calls indicate alarm, and convey that meaning. The complex of Mutter, Twitter, Kweek, and Wicka calls give varied information about the sender's motivational state during interactions. Further analysis is necessary to decipher exact meanings, which depend in any event on the social relations existing between interacting individuals. Other calls and instrumental signals are discussed in a similar manner. Homologies are treated, based on similarities in form and the relation of calls to other calls, displays and situations; evolutionary and ontogenetic effects are related to homology within pied woodpeckers, and to some degree with other picid groups. Some acoustical signals, notably Drumming and Scolding, but even Rattle Calls and Call Notes are effective interspecifically in Picoides, between pied woodpeckers and species of diverse woodpecker genera, and occasionally between pied woodpeckers and birds of other families. Taxonomic applications of the data include as major points the monophyly of the genus Picoides sensu Short (1971a), close relationship of arcticus and tridactylus to the villosus subgroup, monophyly of the American group of Picoides, the distinctness and derived state of medius, and of the major group, and the likelihood that the most primitive members of the genus are to be found in Asia among relatives of the moluccensis and canicapillus groups. Vocalizations are described for two hybrid combinations, major x syricus and scalaris x nuttallii, and are more or less intermediate between those of the parental species.

T1  - Behavior and growth of the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis (Fréminville) in southern Florida.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 160
SP  - 113
N2  - Studies on the behavior of the land crab Gecarcinus lateralis (Fréminville, 1835) were made on a tract of land at Sabal Point, just north of Boca Raton Inlet, Florida. A portion of this tract is a tropical coastal hammock, one of the few remaining among the east coast of Florida. The thick vegetation of the hammock forms a canopy under which environmental conditions are such as to support a dense population of G. lateralis. Here the crabs can be seen outside of their burrows during hours of daylight; such behavior is unusual in this species. At Sabal Point, information has been gathered on type of vegetation used as food and cover by G. lateralis and on activity of this crab. A photographic record of mating has been obtained. Observations indicate that ovigerous females of this species move down the beaches to the ocean to release their young, and young crabs come up these beaches as they begin life on land. Since all stages of growth were available at Sabal Point, we were able to study some parameters of relative growth in G. lateralis.

T1  - Social signals of adult American alligators.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 160
SP  - 155
N2  - For the first time the signaling behaviors of adult American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis Daudin) are described systematically. Eighteen behaviors are divided into eight visual, six vocal, and four nonvocal acoustic signals, but some signals are a composite of elements from all three modalities. Among these signals, most are discrete rather than graded, and nearly all are given by both sexes. Among the vocalizations sound energy is concentrated at less than 1 kHz., with most dominant frequencies less than 250 Hz. Communication over long distances is accomplished by acoustic signals, whereas visual signals are chiefly used at shorter distances between alligators. This dichotomy may be the result of selection for acoustic signals in the alligator's vegetated habitat. Most of the semi-aquatic alligator's social behaviors occur in the water, and the importance of water is illustrated by the many signals that result from the amount of body surface exposed above the water and by the transmission of acoustic signals through the water. Alligators and other crocodilians share many signal elements, although they may be combined in different ways in order to serve different communication functions. The alligator signaling system also shows complexity similar to that reported in birds and mammals, again demonstrating that some reptiles are not behaviorally uncomplicated in spite of their general inferior capacity for sustained metabolic activity.

T1  - Comparative cranial morphology of Recent and fossil turtles.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 164
SP  - 67
N2  - Comparative descriptions of the cranial morphology in living and extinct turtles are presented in this paper. Descriptions are arranged by bone rather than by taxon and attempt to document the types and degrees of differences in cranial structures within the Testudines, emphasizing features of systematic interest. Developmental information is also included. 273 figures supplement the text. About half of these figures show detailed internal morphology and include comparative series showing horizontal and sagittal sections, and oblique views of ear regions for each of the living families of turtles as well as for those extinct families where this information is available. Additional figures, some of which are taken from the literature, show disarticulated elements, inner ear regions, arterial and nerve foramina and canals, and basicranial morphology. The other half of the figures are dorsal, lateral, and ventral views (also occipital views in many cases) of the skull in nearly all living genera of turtles and many extinct genera. The higher category classification used is that developed by Gaffney (1975d) and no taxonomic novelties are announced. A section of text provides a brief literature revew of chelonian systematics and cranial morphology and a listing (by family) of useful turtle skull illustrations from the literature. A revised glossary of anatomical terms and an index are included.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 167
SP  - 281
N2  - A joint American Museum of Natural History-Yale University expedition reopened Quarry Nine at Como Bluff, Wyoming, in 1968-1970. This locality has produced all but six of about 250 Jurassic mammal specimens known from North America prior to 1968. During the renewed collecting, four additional prospects were found in the vicinity, and 25 fossil mammal jaws and numerous teeth were collected. A new genus and species of dryolestid, Comotherium richi, is described. The dryolestid genera Melanodon and Herpetairus are reviewed and rediagnosed. The anterior dentition of Melanodon goodrichi and better material of Herpetairus humilis are described. The crown and labial views of Kepolestes, previously obscured in matrix, are described. No dryolestid jaw in this collection shows any trace of a coronoid or splenial, contrary to the condition reported in Kimmeridgian Portuguese dryolestids. The systematics of primitive Theria are reviewed, and an hypothesis of relationships for the non-tribosphenic Theria is proposed. This hypothesis corroborates the hypothesis of McKenna (1975). It is concluded that the symmetrodonts are a monophyletic group, and that Amphitherium is most closely related to the dryolestids. A cladistic classification of the non-tribosphenic Theria is proposed. Six new taxa are named: sublegions Amphidontoidea and Spalacotherioidea, and infraclasses Tinodontida, Spalacotheriida, Amphitheriida, and Dryolestida. It is strongly urged that the term 'pantothere' be abandoned, because it has misleading phylogenetic connotations and because it obscures non-tribosphenic therian diversity.

N2  - Five murids are known only from Flores: Papagomys armandvillei; P. theodorverhoeveni, new species; Hooijeromys nusatenggara, new genus and species; Floresomys naso, new genus and species; and Spelaeomys florensis. One kind, Komodomys rintjanus, occurs on Flores as well as the Komodo Islands of Rintja and Padar. Papagomys armandvillei still lives on Flores and is also represented by subfossil specimens; P. theodorverhoeveni, F. naso, S. florensis, and K. rintjanus are known by subfossil fragments, the last still lives on the Komodo Islands; and Hooijeromys is based on specimens from sediments thought to be Pleistocene. Characteristics of the species are described. The morphological diversity among them indicates adaptations to different habitats and habits, as well as a bipartite arrangement of phylogenetic affinities. Spelaeomys may be part of a group that includes the genera native to New Guinea. Papagomys clusters with Hooijeromys, Komodomys, and probably Floresomys to form a separate assemblage that has its affinities with Eropeplus and Lenomys on Sulawesi. The postulated relationships of the Floresian rats is set in a framework of possible paleogeographic reconstructions in the Indo-Australian region. The native murids are also contrasted with the rest of the mammalian fauna now known to occur on Flores.

N2  - The genus Rhodobaenus is redescribed and the 29 species of South America are revised. The 29 species include five of the 15 formerly considered as the nawradii group which is here broken up and incorporated with the other species. Ten of the 29 species occur also in Central America or Mexico. Rhodobaenus lebasii (Gyllenhal) is resurrected as a valid species with three new synonyms: femoralis Chevrolat, vittatipennis, and immaculatus of Champion. Additional new synonymy is recorded: ruficollis (Hustache) of aduncus (Erichson); goyaensis (Hustache) of rufirostris (Hustache); cordifer Voss of schnusei Günther; saucius (Gyllenhal) and implicatus, crucicollis, miniatus, nigricornis, bipunctatus, and quinquemaculatus of Chevrolat of suturalis (Gyllenhal). Seven new species are described: R. bivittatus, Bolivia; curvus, Colombia; nivosus, Venezuela; pullus and riparius, Ecuador; quadrus, Peru; rhinopilus, Paraguay. Lectotypes are designated for several species of Champion and Günther.

T1  - A revision of the genus Rattus (Rodentia, Muridae) in the New Guinean region.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 173
SP  - 178
N2  - Eleven native and five introduced species of Rattus occur in New Guinea. The native species are represented by 23 subspecies or monotypic species, all of which are endemic, and ally as three major species groups: (1) R. niobe, R. richardsoni, and R. verecundus; (2) R. praetor, R. mordax, R. leucopus, R. steini, R. giluwensis, R. novaeguineae, and R. jobiensis; and (3) R. sordidus. The first species group is largely montane (to 4500 m. altitude) in distribution, the second includes both montane and lowland species, whereas the third, R. sordidus, is restricted to southern lowlands. One new species, R. novaeguineae, and two new subspecies, R. steini baliemensis and R. verecundus vandeuseni, are proposed and described in this revision. Rattus giluwensis, R. jobiensis, and R. steini are elevated to the rank of full species. Among the native species, we recognize two subspecies of Rattus niobe: R. n. niobe (synonyms = Stenomys rufulus and Stenomys niobe stevensi), and R. n. arrogans (synonyms = Rattus niobe haymani (= klossi), Stenomys niobe arfakiensis, and Rattus niobe pococki (= clarae)); Rattus richardsoni as monotypic (synonym = Rattus omichlodes); four subspecies of Rattus verecundus: R. v. verecundus, R. v. mollis (synonym = Rattus verecundus tomba), R. v. unicolor, and R. v. vandeuseni, new subspecies Taylor and Calaby; two subspecies of Rattus praetor: R. p. praetor (synonyms = Rattus praetor mediocris and Rattus purdiensis), and R. p. coenorum (synonyms = Rattus mordax tramitius, Rattus bandiculus, Rattus leucopus utakwa, and Rattus sansapor); two subspecies of Rattus mordax: R. m. mordax and R. m. fergussoniensis; three subspecies of Rattus leucopus: R. l. ringens, R. l. ratticolor, and R. l. dobodurae; four subspecies of Rattus steini: R. s. steini, R. s. foersteri, R. s. hageni (synonym = Rattus rosalinda), and R. s. baliemensis, new subspecies Taylor and Calaby; Rattus giluwensis as monotypic; Rattus novaeguineae, new species Taylor and Calaby as monotypic; Rattus jobiensis as monotypic (synonyms = Rattus owiensis and Rattus biakensis); and two subspecies of Rattus sordidus: R. s. gestri (synonyms = Rattus brachyrhinus and Rattus gestri bunae) and R. s. aramia. The five introduced species are R. exulans, R. nitidus, R. rattus, R. norvegicus, and R. argentiventer, and all are commensals of human beings. Rattus exulans is represented by a single widespread subspecies in New Guinea, R. e. browni, and its establishment here probably antedates that of the others by several thousand years. It is the only introduced species that we assessed in detail taxonomically and regard it as the senior synonym of the following: Mus? echimyoides, Rattus concolor lassacquèrei, Rattus concolor manoquarius, Rattus browni praecelsus, Rattus browni aitape, Rattus browni suffectus, Rattus browni tibicen, Rattus browni gawae, and Rattus rennelli.

T1  - Malaysian murids and the giant rat of Sumatra.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 174
SP  - 329
N2  - We define the morphological boundaries and elucidate the contents of three Indo-Malayan murid genera: Palawanomys, new genus, known only from Palawan Island; Berylmys, primarily Indochinese in geographic distribution with a representative on the Sunda Shelf; and Sundamys, new genus, containing the giant rat of Sumatra and indigenous to the Sunda Shelf. We contrast the characteristics of these three genera with 11 others that have native species on the Sunda Shelf. Five of the Sundanese (or Malaysian) genera are endemic to the Shelf: Pithecheir, Kadarsanomys, Lenothrix, Palawanomys, and Sundamys. Maxomys, Haeromys, and Chiropodomys are basically Sundaic in that most of the species in each genus are endemic to the Shelf. Most of the species in the genera (Berylmys, Niviventer, Mus, and Rattus) occur outside of the Sunda region. Leopoldamys and Hapalomys are the only two which have an equal number of species in both Indochina and on the Sunda Shelf. We estimate there to be 40 native species of rats and mice on the peninsula and islands of the Sunda Shelf and 10 others whose distributions on the Shelf probably reflect introductions by human agency. Our view of the species and generic diversity of Malaysian murids, in which Rattus is a minor part, is contrasted with that of former workers who looked upon Rattus as a major component of the Sundaic murid fauna. We analyze the distributions of primitive and derived traits among the 14 native genera and examine possible phylogenetic relationships among them. Patterns formed by these alliances as well as by geographic distributions of the genera are described; questions are posed that will require answers from additional study.

N2  - In the present report, the third in a series on Bledius, the annularis and emarginatus groups are discussed and a new species is described in the aequatorialis group. A key to the species, descriptions, diagnoses, illustrations, and distributional and habitat data for each species are presented. Bledius habrus, melanocolus, aurantius, jucundus, naius, nardus, omega, venus, viriosus, wudus, and zophus are newly described. Thirteen nominal species are recognized as synonyms. Bledius albidipennis Bernhauer and ornatus LeConte are new junior synonyms of albonotatus Mäklin; apicalis Fall is a new junior synonym of diagonalis LeConte; adjustus Casey and transitus Fall are new junior synonyms of gentilis Casey; kincaidi Hatch is a new junior synonym of parvicollis Casey; rusticus Fall is a new junior synonym of bicolor Casey; luteipennis LeConte, medialis Fall, oregonensis Hatch, and pleuralis LeConte are new junior synonyms of suturalis LeConte; and borealis Blatchley and bowronensis Hatch are new junior synonyms of turgidus Casey. The species in the United States included in the emarginatus group are cognatus LeConte, emarginatus (Say), and wudus Herman. They are found in the eastern and southeastern United States. The species are similar and not easily distinguished. Bledius albonotatus Mäklin, aurantius Herman, bicolor Casey, cedarensis Hatch, confusus LeConte, diagonalis LeConte, gentilis Casey, gracilis Casey, habrus Herman, jucundus Herman, laticollis LeConte, melanocolus Herman, monticola Casey, naius Herman, nardus Herman, newelli Hatch, omega Herman, parvicollis Casey, persimilis Fall, phytosinus LeConte, ruficornis LeConte, suturalis LeConte, tarandus Herman, tau LeConte, turgidus Casey, venus Herman, villosus Casey, viriosus Herman and zophus Herman are species from the United States and Canada included in the annularis group and which I can identify. Also included in the annularis group are nine species listed together in what I call the annularis complex: annularis LeConte, breretoni Hatch, honestus Casey, languidus Casey, mysticus Fall, nebulosus Casey, sinuatus LeConte, stabilis Casey, and washingtonensis Hatch. After years of study and collecting I have been unable to resolve the species of this complex which is widespread in Canada and the northern United States. I was unable to resolve three other species: fasciatus (Say), longipennis Mäklin, and verticalis Notman; the types of each have been lost but I discuss each of them. The annularis group species are widespread in the United States and Canada and most are found in shaded soil near fresh water. Only two, albonotatus and newelli, are associated with coastal, saline habitats. Several species, notably ruficornis, tarandus, and turgidus, have transcontinental distributions, and one, albonotatus, is found along the coast from western Alaska to Baja California. The addition of a new species, susae, to the aequatorialis group brings that group up to four. However, susae is the only one of the group known only from the United States which is found only on the mainland. It is also the sole species of Bledius in which the females have a pronotal horn; although pronotal horns are known in a number of New and Old World species, heretofore no females have been reported with such a modification. Since publication of Parts I and II of this monograph, I have examined over 6000 more specimens of 41 previously revised species. In Appendix II all the new records are included; for many species extensions of their previously known range are recorded. Lectotypes are designated for the species of Bledius described by LeConte, Casey, and Fall. For Part III, 28,408 specimens were examined.

T1  - A generic revision of the New World Nacophorini (Lepidoptera, Geometridae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 175
SP  - 147
N2  - The present paper is the first attempt to define the genera of the New World Nacophorini. Owing to the very large number of species of the Ennominae, to which the Nacophorini belong, an almost complete lack of previous revisionary studies, and no earlier effort to delimit this tribe for the entire New World, the results of the present paper must be considered provisional at best; hopefully, a good starting point has been established for continuing research and understanding of the Nacophorini. A total of 187 species was studied, and 161 columns of data were obtained for each of them based on external morphology and the male and female genitalia. In a number of cases it was possible to establish the relative plesiomorphy or apomorphy for these character states. A grouping of the species resulted in their being placed in 40 genera; some of their more important characters are listed in several tables, are fully described, and are separable by using the keys to the adults based on external morphology and male genitalia. Illustrations for adults and genitalia of all genera are included. Ceratonyx, Yermoia, and Dentinalia, all previously revised by me, were found to be polyphyletic and have been subdivided. The following new genera are proposed; the type species is given only when it is described as new in this revision: Papago, Salasaca (S. spinea), Hildalgo, Cundinamarca (C. parallela), Aragua, Azuayia, Tarma, Charca (C. triquetra), Nazca, Rucana, Achagua (A. obsolete), Quillaca (Q. earina), Anischnopteris, Canelo (C. constrictus), Aconcagua, Arauco, Omaguacua, Huapianus (H. obater), and Poya. The following changes in status are proposed: Mallomus, described by E. Blanchard in the Hepialidae, was found to belong to the Nacophorini; this name takes priority over Salpis Mabille and its several synonyms. Dasystole Warren is also placed in the synonymy of Mallomus. Ischnopterix Hübner and Amblurodes Warren are synonymized under Ischnopteris Hübner. Catophoenissa Warren and Calvertia Warren are transferred to the Lithinini; Talca catophoenissoides Angulo is placed as a synonym of Calvertia fumipennis Warren. The tribe is divided into four groups based on a combination of characters including, among others, the presence or absence of a functional proboscis, a simple or complex uncus in the male genitalia, and present-day distribution. An analysis of the character states with regard to which are relatively more primitive or more derived suggests that the two most plesiotypic groups are found primarily in North America and in Chile and southern Argentina. In the New World the Nacophorini are found from southern Canada to Chile and southern Argentina, plus the Greater Antilles and the Galapagos Islands. The tribe is also known from Australia and Tasmania. This Chilean-southem South American and Australian distribution strongly suggests that the Gondwanian fragmentation contributed to the present-day distribution of the tribe. These Gondwanian elements, plus plesiotypic components in North America, indicate an ancestral distribution of perhaps pre-Gondwanian age. The Greater Antillean-Galapagos distribution, found in Thyrinteina, can possibly be explained by the ancestral moths being present on the proto-Antilles in the late Mesozoic when this volcanic archipelago connected North and South America; subsequent plate tectonic events formed the Greater Antilles in an eastern movement and the Galapagos in a southwestern shift in the middle or late Tertiary. The present distribution of Holochroa is in the southwestern United States, western Mexico, and the Tres Marías Islands; the group is not known from Baja California. This peninsula was originally part of western Mexico; it began to separate from the mainland at least four million years ago. The Tres Marías Islands are undoubtedly a fragment of the original peninsula that broke off during the rafting of the latter; the separation of Baja California was completed by late Miocene and early Pliocene. Presumably, representatives of the ancestral Holochroa were in western Mexico prior to the splitting; they, for whatever reasons, separated into two species on the Tres Marías but apparently did not survive on the Baja California peninsula.

T1  - A taxonomic revision of the Andean killifish genus Orestias (Cyprinodontiformes, Cyprinodontidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 178
SP  - 110
N2  - The ichthyofauna of the high Andes is assumed to be of low taxonomic diversity. Only three fish genera, the killifish Orestias and the catfishes Astroblepus and Trichomycterus include species endemic to the Altiplano, the high-attitude plateau between the eastern and western slopes of the central Andes. The atherinid Basilichthys is known doubtfully from the Altiplano. In the last revision of the genus Orestias, Tchernavin (1944a) recognized 20 species and five subspecies. This small number was taken as evidence of the low diversity of fish of the Titicaca Basin. However, in the past two years, five new Orestias species have been described, three from Lago Titicaca (Lauzanne, 1981) and two from the Altiplano of northern Chile (Arratia, 1982). With the benefit of large recent collections, 43 species of Orestias are recognized in the present revision, 14 being described as new (O. gracilis, O. rotundipinnis, O. farfani, O. gymnotus, O. hardini, O. ctenolepis, O. ascotanensis, O. richersoni, O. multiporis, O. mundus, O. ututo, O. imarpe, O. tomcooni, and O. robustus). Seven synapomorphies described here define Orestias as a monophyletic group: (1) pelvic fins and fin girdle are absent; (2) vomer is absent; (3) middle anal and middle dorsal fin radials are cartilaginous, rather than ossified; (4) bony anterior and posterior ceratohyal are separated ventrally by a large gap filled with cartilage; (5) first postcleithrum is absent; (6) anguloarticular lacks a ventral extension parallel to the retroarticular; and (7) there is a unique squamation and head pore pattern characterized by a prominent lyre-shaped arrangement of minute neuromasts and a prominent median dorsal ridge of scales running from the top of the head to the dorsal fin origin. Primary characters used to distinguish Orestias species are overall body shape and squamation pattern. Diversity of form is marked. There are large, troutlike midwater predators, such as O. cuvieri, diminutive inshore species such as O. minutus and O. minimus, and very wide-headed and wide-bodied species, with large, thick granulated scales, such as O. luteus and O. albus. The diversity among Orestias species in Lago Titicaca, the large, high-altitude lake of the Altiplano of Peru and Bolivia, has led to the application of the term 'species flock' to this group of lacustrine killifish. However, the Orestias of Titicaca do not form a monophyletic group, and it is recommended that the term 'species flock' not be used for the killifishes limited to the lake. The known range of Orestias extends from northern Peru to northern Chile. It is expected that the number will rise with additional collecting, because collections are lacking from many of the small, isolated lakes of the Altiplano; also, single specimens of apparently new species are known, yet remain undescribed.

N2  - Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, occupies a transitional zone comprising the southern end of the forested coastal mountains of southeastern Brazil and the northern reaches of the open, rolling or hilly grassland typical of Uruguay. It has additional geographic diversity from its Atlantic beaches, bits of chaco-type terrain in the extreme west, and more tropical type forests along the upper reaches of the Rio Uruguay. The bird life of the region reflects this variety. So far, 586 species have been registered for the state, 457 of them treated here as confirmed, probable, or potential nesters in the area. Of these nesters, 349 are known or assumed to have full-time resident populations in the state, while another 70 are migrants that spend the winter months elsewhere. The status of the other 38 remains to be clarified. Only 166 of these breeding species have ranges that extend beyond Rio Grande do Sul on all land sides, the remaining 291 encountering an edge to their ranges somewhere within. As a consequence, each section of the state has its own unique combination of bird species, and no one area is likely to have much more than half the total. Of the remaining 129 species, 14 are probably extinct, 53 are vagrants, and 62 are regular non-breeding migrants. This last group includes pelagic visitors, winter migrants from the southern cone of South America, North American species spending the northern winter months, and species in transit one or both ways between nesting and wintering grounds. Sporadic scientific collecting activity has occurred in Rio Grande do Sul since the early 1820s, but this is the first attempt at a comprehensive survey of the avifauna of the state. Information obtained from literature, museums, other observers, and my own fieldwork extending from 1970 to 1983 is compiled in individual accounts for each species. Data are usually provided on distribution, relative abundance, migration, habitat, field marks, size, soft part colors, voice, breeding, behavior, and museum specimens. A number of suggestions are made for future ornithological investigation. Conservation action is urged to save such favored sites as the espinilho parkland and the Lagoa do Peixe, and to protect additional roosting areas of the menaced red-spectacled parrot, Amazona pretrei.

T1  - Australian frogs of the family Microhylidae.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 182
SP  - 267
N2  - Study of abundant new material leads to the recognition of 16 species in the Australian microhylid fauna, all but one endemic, in contrast to 8 previously known. One of 5 Sphenophryne and 6 of 11 Cophixalus are described as new species. Differences between advertisement calls are crucial to distinguishing between members of two pairs of sibling species and are important in diagnosing other species. One species of Sphenophryne inhabiting northern Cape York Peninsula and southern New Guinea is the only microhylid common to both areas. It and its sibling in the Northern Territory inhabit regions with prolonged dry seasons, in contrast to the three remaining species of Sphenophryne which are confined to rainforest in tropical northeast Queensland. One species of Cophixalus occurs in a boulder-jumble area a few kilometers outside the rainforest boundary, whereas the other ten apparently live only in rainforest. Most species of Cophixalus are known only from one or two localities but one -- C. ornatus -- has an extensive range, more than 300 km from north to south. The species of Sphenophryne inhabit leaf litter. Only one Cophixalus is principally a ground dweller, the remaining species being more or less scansorial. Like other genyophrynine microhylids, the Australian species presumably all lay large eggs in sheltered, terrestrial situations. An adult frog, male in the few verified instances, accompanies the eggs, which undergo direct development, producing fully formed froglets. The five species of Sphenophryne include two sibling pairs, with all five species being so similar morphologically that they were taxonomically confused in the earlier literature. The Australian species share no characters clearly apomorphic for the genus, and little can be said as to relationships with the more diverse New Guinean Sphenophryne. Similar mating call structure among the Australian Sphenophryne suggests that they form a monophyletic group, but the possibility remains that the calls are primitive and not indicative of close relationship. Australian Cophixalus are morphologically much more diverse than Sphenophryne, though similarly tied together by commonality of elements in the advertisement calls (quite different from those of Sphenophryne) that implies monophyly. Interspecific comparisons of body proportions by use of regression lines reveal many similarities and differences among species, but placement of particular characters on a primitive-derived axis is far from satisfactory. Furthermore, parallel development of presumably apomorphic traits seems to have been common. As a result, the relationships diagrammed are even more subjective than usual. Previous assessments of the Australian microhylids as a slightly differentiated group derived by dispersal from New Guinea are rejected. Paleoclimatic evidence that tropical rainforest habitat suitable for microhylids has been present in northern Australia since well before the Pleistocene, the accessibility of Australia-New Guinea to Southeast Asia since the Miocene collision of plates, and the high degree of endemicity in Australia argue for a long history in situ. Whether the Australian microhylids derive directly from a Gondwanan source, originate from Gondwana indirectly by way of Indian continental drift and subsequent dispersal through Southeast Asia to Australia, or are not of Gondwanan origin at all remains unresolved.

T1  - Evolution and systematics of Cerion (Mollusca, Pulmonata) on New Providence Island : a radical revision.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 182
SP  - 390
N2  - Cerion has been described by its leading student W.J. Clench as 'the most difficult genus of pulmonate mollusks to classify.' No other pulmonate genus shows greater diversity of form; moreover, almost all these divergent morphologies hybridize at their areas of geographic contact. The result is a taxonomic morass that has effectively debarred fruitful biological work on these fascinating snails. The taxonomy of New Providence Island is the most elaborate for the entire genus; more than 90 species of Cerion have been designated, and the distribution of existing names makes no geographic or ecological sense. We use morphometric and genetic techniques to conclude that the living Cerion of New Providence reduce to two semispecies, C. glans (the ribby morphotype) and C gubernatorium (the mottled morphotype). Traces of an extinct C. agassizi line (a prominent taxon of fossil dunes) survive as introgressions into C. gubernatorium populations of southeastern New Providence. These two groups form the basis of Cerion faunas throughout the northern Bahamas; their separation and recognition provide a key to resolving Cerion's taxonomy both here and elsewhere. Ribby and mottled morphotypes are recurrently evolved 'developmental packages,' not homologous taxa from place to place -- thereby illustrating the importance of developmental channeling in parallel evolution. We base our taxonomic decision upon a conciliance among many independent criteria. Geographic distribution: parental morphotypes occupy their expected positions, with narrow hybrid zones at predicted points of transition. Morphology of parental populations: differences between ribby and mottled are not simple consequences of one minor alteration in growth, but summed results of several independent covariance sets. Morphotypes differ consistently in amounts of variation and patterns of covariance. Hybrid populations: we find both enhanced variation and patterns of covariance based on developmental disturbance never before detected in parental populations of Cerion. Genetics: samples grouped by frequencies of electromorphs yield the same clusters of ribby and mottled populations specified by morphology. Morphotypes can be distinguished by allele frequencies, while hybrid populations contain rare alleles found in neither parental taxon. The genetic hybrid zone is wider than the morphological zone and asymmetric about it. An appendix allocates all previously named taxa, and resolves the status of 19 designated fossil taxa, plus a new species (Cerion clenchi), into three successive faunas, marking waves of migration correlated with rise and fall of Pleistocene seas.

T1  - Revision of Bledius. Part 4, Classification of species groups, phylogeny, natural history, and catalogue (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Oxytelinae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090

N2  - The purpose of this monograph is to review and reinterpret what is known about Bledius with the goal of prompting further study of the genus. Included are a new infrageneric classification for the world; discussions of the life cycle, habitat, distribution, enemies, chemical secretions, economic importance, immature stages, fossils, and phylogeny; and a cross-indexed annotated catalogue to the taxonomic names and associated literature. Formal taxonomic changes include the following: Bledius minniensis from Armenia is a new species, Neobledius is a new synonym of Bledius and Elbidus, and Microbledius and Psamathobledius are new synonyms of Bledius. New combinations include B. karachiensis transferred from Neobledius and actitus, litoreus, and playanus transferred from Microbledius. New names include albanicus and jutlandensis which replace the preoccupied nebulosus Koch and atlanticus Lohse, respectively. The following names are labeled as new status: B. castaneipennis Mannerheim is elevated from synonymy with opacus Block; atramentarius Rottenberg is elevated from synonymy with and replaces bos Fauvel which was described a year later; limicola Tottenham is elevated from synonymy with and replaces germanicus Wagner which is preoccupied by germanicus Gravenhorst; minor Mulsant and Rey is elevated from synonymy with and replaces devillei Bondroit which was an unnecessary replacement name. Two names are emended: cariniceps for carinlceps and ghesquierei for guesquierei. Six names, bubalus Gistel, castaneus Mulsant and Rey, chimerinus Gistel, germanicus Gravenhorst, gyllenhalii Laporte, and westerhauseri Gistel are used herein for the first time since their original publication. All eight currently recognized subgenera are treated as synonyms of Bledius. In their place a classification of 34 species groups is proposed. This classification is based on examination of 422 of the 439 species of Bledius. The species were assigned to species groups based on examination of type material or subsequently identified specimens. Nine species were assigned to species groups from characters in the original description -- each such assignment is clearly indicated. Eight species are listed as incertae sedis for one or more of the following reasons: material was unavailable for study, the description did not cite sufficient information for placement in a species group, the types were lost, or the species was unknown. Descriptions, illustrations, a list of included species and localities, and a distributional map are provided for each species group along with a key to the group. No effort was made to define or revise species. The monophyly of Bledius is established by the presence of a cluster of secretory pores in a prosternal pit or depression and the possession in females of a pair of elongate, undivided genital sclerites on segment IX. Both Bledius and its sister genus Eppelsheimius have a central row of spine-like setae on the hypopharynx; they share other characters as well. The relationships among the species groups are shown in a cladogram on which many characters are homoplasic. Bledius comprises two main lineages. One with 14 species groups and 88 species includes, among others, the large robust species with horns. Most species of this branch live in saline habitats. Two of the species groups are restricted to the New World. The sister lineage includes the remaining 20 species groups and more than 340 species. A terminal cluster of species groups along with species in three other groups live in saline habitats; the others, including the four most speciose groups, live in freshwater habitats. In this lineage 3 species groups are confined to the New World, 11 to the Old, and the remaining 6 are widespread in both hemispheres. The primitive habitat for Bledius was near salt water. One descendent remains there; the other adapted to the freshwater habitat. In this second lineage some highly speciose groups developed near freshwater and there was a reinvasion of the saline habitat. Bledius is a large genus of 439 species, some of which occur in huge populations. Species are found on all continents except Antarctica and on most continental islands but are absent from most oceanic islands. Although only a third of the species lives in saline habitats (inland as well as coastal), these species represent two-thirds of the species groups. Two-thirds of the species live in freshwater habitats, representing the remaining third of the species groups. Bledius may have lived as far back as the Cretaceous. Nine fossil species have been described as belonging in Bledius, however, two of these are no longer included. Of the remaining seven only Bledius glaciatus from the Pleistocene and B. primitiarum of the Oligocene are likely to be Bledius. Another probable member of Bledius is Staphylinus lesleyi Scudder also of the Oligocene; this species has not been moved to Bledius. Although the oldest probable fossils of Bledius are about 35 million years old, evidence suggests that the Oxytelinae existed about 150 million years ago during the Jurassic. Species of Bledius are most abundant in unvegetated or lightly vegetated, sunny, moist sand adjacent to rivers, lakes, and oceans. They preferentially select their habitat based on soil moisture, salinity, texture, and, indirectly at least, size of the sand grains, availability of food, and amount of shade. The pressure of predators may influence habitat limits but that may be partly due to the physiological weakening of a Bledius that is not living in its optimal habitat. Although as yet undemonstrated, food plant specificity may influence habitat selection by Bledius. Bledius lives in burrows which adults excavate with their mandibles and strengthen with their protibiae. The burrows are several millimeters to about 40 cm deep and about 1 to 5 mm in diameter. Larvae also construct and live in burrows. Eggs are laid in special egg chambers; some species cache food in the burrow. The burrow serves not only as living quarters for Bledius but helps protect them. Bledius can live at a relative humidity of 100 percent to no less than 93 percent. The humidity within the burrow is nearly 100 percent. Some seacoastal species live in the intertidal zone where they remain during high tide. Individuals that stay in the burrow during high tide live in an air bubble, which acts as a physical gill, and are immediately active after the tide recedes. Individuals exposed directly to seawater fly away or survive by becoming comatose and recover only slowly when removed from the water; most, however, die after a few hours of immersion. Usually the adults overwinter in deep burrows. Eggs are deposited during spring or early summer and develop in two to three weeks. The larval stage lasts for six to eight weeks and the five instars are each of undetermined length. Pupae exist for about a week. Egg to adult then is two to three months. During the summer adults live for three to six weeks. Females oviposit several times; the number of generations per year is unclear but may vary according to species and climate. Larval characters have been published for 19 species. Adults and larvae feed on algae and diatoms that live in the moisture surrounding each sand grain. The green algae there are said to be stunted filamentous forms. Some Bledius facultatively store algae. Some species are said to exhibit subsocial behavior by attending to their offspring. Evidence for this interpretation is inconclusive. Carabid beetles of Dyschirius are regarded as the principal predators of Bledius. However, little evidence is found to support a species-specific host-prey relationship. More likely, the relationship of Bledius and Dyschirius is based on geographical distribution and habitat preference. Over 50 species of Dyschirius are reported with over 80 species of Bledius. Other Carabidae reported as actual or probable predators of Bledius include species of Cillenum, Bembidion, Pogonus, Dicheirotrichus, Clivina, and Schizogenius. The ichneumonid wasp, Barycnemis blediator, is a parasitoid of Bledius spectabilis. Sandpipers and rainbow trout also eat Bledius. Fungi of the order Laboulbeniales commonly infest Bledius and, although usually regarded as benign, one report suggests otherwise. Species of Bledius secrete a characteristic, penetratingly fragrant chemical of five components. That this secretion functions as a defensive chemical is debatable. No experimentally supported hypotheses have explained the function of this compound. One species in Japan was reported to do economically significant damage to clay beds used to produce salt by evaporation of seawater. The literature for and taxonomic names used in Bledius are summarized in a catalogue. Fifteen generic-level names have been used in Bledius; 646 species-level names have been used, 434 of which are presently listed as valid and extant. All names that have been included in Bledius are listed in the catalogue. The species names are cross-indexed and the references annotated.

N2  - Bledius is redescribed, and a key to the species-groups of the New World is presented. The species of the aequatorialis, mandibularis, and semiferrugineus groups of Bledius Leach from the Nearctic and West Indian areas and two new genera, Microbledius and Psamathobledius, are described. Illustrations, keys, diagnoses, and distributional and habitat data are presented for each species. Three new species, Microbledius playanus, Microbledius actitus, and Microbledius litoreus are described and M. forcipatus (Le Conte), M. albidus (Sharp), M. albipennis (Bernhauer), M. bifasciatus (Sharp), M. miles (Bernhauer), M. minutissimus (Bernhauer), and M. weiseri (Bernhauer) are transferred from Bledius. Psamathobledius contains P. caribbeanus (Blackwelder), P. microcephalus (Fauvel) and P. punctatissimus (Le Conte) (B. esposus Blackwelder is a new synonymy); all are transferred from Bledius. Bledius aequatorialis Mutchler, B. beattyi Blackwelder, and B. ceratus Blackwelder are included in the aequatorialis group. Bledius mandibularis Erichson, B. pallipennis Say (B. gularis Le Conte is a new synonymy), B. fortis Le Conte, B. ferratus Le Conte, and B. jacobinus Le Conte (B. actus Herman is a new synonymy) are in the mandibularis group. Bledius semiferrugineus Le Conte (B. canaliculatus Notman is a new synonymy), B. foraminosus Casey (B. relictus Fall and B. deceptivus Fall are new synonymies), B. tallaci Fall, B. gravidus Casey (B. missionensis Hatch is a new synonymy), B. rotundicollis Le Conte, B. rubiginosus Erichson, B. fumatus Le Conte, B. philadelphicus Fall (B. dickersoni Notman and B. mixtus Notman are new synonymies), and B. analis Le Conte, B. nitidicollis Le Conte, B. assimilis Casey, and B. coulteri Hatch are included in the semiferrugineus group.

T1  - The avifauna of the Kakamega Forest, western Kenya, including a bird population study.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History

VL  - 149
SP  - 257
N2  - The bird fauna of the Kakamega Forest in western Kenya was studied between June and August, 1963, 1965, and 1966. Special attention was given to a 20-acre tract within relatively undisturbed climax growth where continued bird censusing was undertaken. The census area was utilized by a minimum of 408 adult birds in 1963 and a maximum of 487 adults in 1966. On the tract 125 species -- largely true forest birds -- were identified. One hundred and forty-four bird species dependent on forest or closely associated with forest have been recorded in the Kakamega region. These are named in an appendix prepared by the author and Alec Forbes-Watson. The avifaunal affinities of Kakamega are with the lowland Congo and western Uganda forests, as indicated by the 107 species (78 true forest birds) they share in common. Although very few east-central African sylvan avifaunas have been studied in detail, the number of forest bird species in Kakamega appears second only to the altitudinally diverse Impenetrable Forest of western Uganda. Impenetrable Forest supports 69 montane and 99 lowland bird species compared with 34 and 98, respectively, at Kakamega. Despite apparent similarities in general climate and vegetation structure of Kakamega and the Amani Forest of northeastern Tanzania, more than 57 percent of the Amani Forest birds are lacking at Kakamega and 80 percent of the birds of Kakamega do not occur at Amani. Historic factors are presumed to be responsible for some of the differences. As suggested by Moreau, a rough correlation may exist between bird species diversity and woody plant species diversity -- at least in tropical African lowland evergreen forests. Scarcity of floristic data limits detailed comparisons at present.

VL  - 149

N2  - The geometrid moths heretofore assigned to the genera Mericisca Hulst, Tracheops Hulst, Parapheromia McDunnough, and Merisma McDunnough were studied from the United States. The Mexican fauna was also examined for speices that belong to this group. These studies show that the above four groups are not distinct on a generic level, even though each one forms a small and compact group of species. Consequently they have been placed as subgenera of Mericisca. In addition, it was necessary to erect the new subgenus Puebla for two Mexican species. The moths assigned to Mericisca are distributed from Wyoming and the southern Rocky Mountain states and western Texas in the United States, south to the temperate, mountainous regions of Mexico as far as the State of Chiapas and vicinity. A total of 24 species are included in the genus. Nine are described in this revision as new; of these, eight are from Mexico and one is from Arizona and new Mexico. The genus, all subgnera, and each species are described; distributional information is given for all species insofar as known. Keys are given for all subgenera and species. The adults and their genitalia are figured.

T1  - Systematics of native Australian Rattus (Rodentia, Muridae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 150
SP  - 1
N2  - The native Australian Rattus are represented by five species and 14 subspecies. The progenitor of these native Rattus appears to be an ancestral form of R. lutreolus which gave rise to two major lines. One line represents the forest species, R. fuscipes and R. leucopus, and of these, R. fuscipes appears to have given rise to R. leucopus through a R. f. coracius-like ancestor. The other major line is composed of the grassland species, R. sordidus and R. tunneyi. The link between these two is postulated as being through the two subspecies R. t. culmorum-R. s. sordidus. Rattus tunneyi tunneyi is the most distant subspecies from the R. lutreolus-type progenitor along this line, and R. leucopus cooktownensis is the most remote along the line of forest forms. Rattus exulans subspecies, which occurs within the political boundaries of Australia probably as a result of human biochore dispersal, is included in this study chiefly because it has been allied with native Rattus on occasion in previous investigations. We recognize four subspecies of Rattus fuscipes: R. f. fuscipes (synonyms = R. f. mondraineus and R. f. glauerti), R. f. greyii (synonyms = R. murrayi, R. greyii ravus, R. greyii peccatus, and R. greyii pelori), R. f. assimilis, and R. f. coracius (synonym = R. manicatus); two subspecies of Rattus leucopus: R. l. leucopus (synonym = R. l. mcilwraithi) and R. l. cooktownensis; three subspecies of Rattus lutreolus: R. l. lutreolus (synonyms = R. vellerosus, R. l. cambricus, and R. l. imbil), R. l. velutinus (synonym = ?Mus tasmaniensis), and R. l. lacus; three subspecies of Rattus sordidus: R. s. sordidus (synonyms = R. conatus and R. youngi), R. s. villosissimus (synonym = R. villosissimus profusus), and R. s. colletti; and two subspecies of R. tunneyi: R. t. tunneyi (synonyms = Mus woodwardi, R. melvilleus, and R. tunneyi dispar) and R. t. culmoram (synonyms = R. culmorum vallesius, R. culmorum austrinus, and R. culmorum apex).

T1  - The species of gizzard shads (Dorosomatinae) with particular reference to the Indo-Pacific region.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 150
SP  - 133
N2  - The Indo-Pacific fishes commonly called gizzard shads include two tribes (the Anodontostomatini and Clupanodontini) and at least 12 species (Anodontostoma chacunda, Gonialosa manmina, G. modesta, Nematalosa arabica, N. come, N. erebi, N. galatheae, new species, N. japonica, N. nasus, N. vlaminghi, new combination, Clupanodon punctatus and C. thrissa). These species are generally better defined and more easily recognized by nonmeristic characters than by counts of scales, fin rays, vertebrae, ventral scutes, and predorsal bones. The North American gizzard shads include one tribe (Dorosomatini) and, as currently recognized, five species (Dorosoma anale, D. cepedianum, D. chavesi, D. smithi, and D. (Signalosa) petenense), defined primarily on the basis of meristic characters. This paper reviews the taxonomy of the Indo-Pacific species and provides a key for their identification, an account of their variation and distribution, and an analysis of their scientific literature. For North American species, references to recent literature are included. The gut of the gizzard shads differs from that of other clupeoids in having a third primary flexure. The tribes recognized are based partly on the variations of the third flexure.

N2  - The systematics of the subfamily Protoceratinae are revised and its evolution, phylogeny, and zoogeography outlined. The stratigraphic range of the subfamily extends from the Chadronian (early Oligocene) to the Clarendonian (middle Pliocene); geographically, the subfamily ranges from the northern Great Plains (South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming) southward to Texas and into Panama. The Protoceratinae now include four genera: Heteromeryx, Pseudoprotoceras, Protoceras, and Paratoceras. Calops Marsh is here synonymized with Protoceras; specific synonymies within each genus are also treated. Two new species of Protoceras are recognized: P. skinneri from South Dakota and Nebraska and P. neatodelpha from Wyoming. New skull and horn material allows an expanded description and diagnosis of Paratoceras, and a new species, P. wardi, from the Barstovian of the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain is erected.

T1  - Systematics and evolution of the Gruiformes (class Aves). 3, Phylogeny of the suborder Grues.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 151
SP  - 1
N2  - A comparative analysis of both fossil and Recent species of the suborder Grues of the order Gruiformes is presented here. A phylogeny is proposed for the families studied and is constructed on the premise that monophyletic taxa can be defined only by the recognition of shared, derived character-states. The suborder Grues can be divided into two lineages, the infraorders Ralli and Grui. Two families comprise the Ralli: the Rallidae and Laornithidae. The Grui diverged into two major radiations at the beginning of the Tertiary: (1) the Geranoidea (Geranoididae, Bathornithidae, Idiornithidae), and (2) the Gruoidea (Eogruidae, Ergilornithidae, Gruidae, Aramidae, Psophiidae). The Geranoididae are the most morphologically primitive members of the Grui. The bathornithids and idiornithids share many derived features, presumably inherited from a geranoidid-like ancestor. The ergilornithids were apparently derived from an eogruid-like ancestor. The Gruidae, Aramidae, and Psophiidae form a separate lineage within the Gruoidea, with the last two families having the closest relationship. A new family of the infraorder Ralli, the Laornithidae, is described for the late Cretaceous species Laornis edvardsianus Marsh. The new fossil species described are: Palaeorallus brodkorbi (Rallidae), Quercyrallus quercy (Rallidae), Palaeoaramides minutus (Rallidae), and Idiornis gaillardi (Idiornithidae). Revisions are presented for the pre-Pleistocene extinct genera of the following families: Rallidae, Idiornithidae, Eogruidae, Ergilornithidae, Gruidae, and Aramidae. A number of genera are transferred from one family to another. Various schemes of classification for the Grues are briefly discussed It is suggested that a classification which expresses monophyletic relationships in a strict manner (i.e, dichotomously) is to be preferred.

VL  - 151

N2  - The black fly fauna of cool and cold temperate South America is composed of a comparatively small number of species of Simulium (Simuliinae, Simuliini) and several genera and species of the Prosimuliini. This survey of Neotropical Prosimuliini, which also includes Guatemalan and Mexican highland forms, is a taxonomic treatment mainly on the generic level accompanied by notes on biology and geographical distribution. The following genera, as arranged by their geographical areas, are dealt with: Mayacnephia, new genus (type: Simulium pachecolunai De Leon) and Tlalocomyia Wygodzinsky and Díaz Nájera (Mesoamerican highlands); Araucnephia, new genus (type: Simulium montanum Philippi) and Araucnephioides, new genus (type: Araucnephioides schlingeri, new species) (Mediterranean climate area of central Chile); Cnesia Enderlein, Cnesiamina, new genus (type: Simulium atroparvum Edwards) and Paraustrosimulium Wygodzinsky and Coscarón (Valdivian and Magellanic areas of southern Chile, and western Patagonia); and Lutzsimulium d'Andretta and d'Andretta (coastal ranges of southern Brazil). Species are also described, redescribed, or discussed as well as illustrated, except for the large genus Gigantodax which is planned to be monographed later. Cnesia ornata and Cnesia pusilla (western Patagonia) are new species; Cnesia gynandrum is synonymized with Cnesia dissimilis. None of the genera listed is found in America north of Mexico, or on other continents. It has not been possible to trace the origin and routes of dispersal of the Latin American prosimuliine genera, but some intergeneric affinities, especially among sympatric genera, are postulated.

VL  - 151
SP  - 287
N2  - Six species (one new) including 20 subspecies (4 new) of Phacops are recognized from the Lower and Middle Devonian of North America. Gedinnian-Siegenian species include P. logani Hall, 1861, and P. claviger Haas, 1969. Phacops clarksoni, new species, occurs in the Emsian Schoharie Formation of New York, and P. cristata Hall, 1861, occurs in the Emsian and Eifelian of the Appalachian Province. Phacops iowensis Delo, 1935, and P. rana (Green, 1832) occur in Givetian strata. A conservative position is taken on generic nomenclature and defended herein; all species, with the exception of P. rana are closely related and belong to the same monophyletic taxon. Special topics include a quantitative analysis of eye polymorphism and ontogeny in Phacops logani birdsongensis Delo, 1940, and P. logani raymondi (Delo, 1935), and of eye ontogeny in Phacops cristata stummi, new subspecies and P. c. canadensis (Stumm, 1954). Cladistic methodology in paleontology is briefly discussed, and theories of relationship among all subspecies and species are presented. A key to all Devonian phacopid taxa considered valid herein is included.

N2  - The characters and history of the subfamily Cholinae together with a comparison with the subfamily Hylobiinae are presented. A taxonomic revision is made of two of the 33 genera of the Cholinae (Homalinotus with 21 species, and Ozopherus, monotypic). These genera occur in Central and South America and the Antilles, where some of the species breed in and damage palms, especially the coconut palm. A strongly sclerotized basal sclerite or copulating armature is found in the aedeagus of all species. Five new species from South America are described: Homalinotus alloides, praelongus, pectinis, kuscheli, and inopinatus. Homalinotus densatus Desbrochers des Loges is transferred to Cholus; H. cyanicollis (Olivier) remains unidentified; H. umbilicatus Desbrochers des Loges from Guadeloupe is reinstated as a valid species. Five species are placed in synonymy. Abebaeus Kirsch is added to the synonymy of Homalinotus. Photographs of all species are given.

VL  - 152
SP  - 105
N2  - More than 8300 sipunculans from more than 500 stations of the east coast of the United States are identified and described. The area under investigation extends from Nova Scotia to cape Kennedy, Florida, in depths from 10 to 5400 meters. Several abiotic factors of the environment (topography, currents, temperature, and sediments) are described. Each species is characterized morphologically and also in terms of depth, latitude, sediment, and temperature. A key is given for the identification of all the 26 species collected. Distribution maps for the species are presented, as well as figures showing their morphology. In the description of each species, particular attention is paid to variation in morphology due to ontogeny. Several combinations of existing species names are suggested. Based on abiotic niche features, the species are grouped into four major ecological units: southern, shallow, warm water; northern, shallow, cold water; slope; and abyssal. Competitive exclusion operates within each of these groups except the abyssal fauna; this group has more sympatric species than the shallower groups and their morphology is less distinctive. One possible explanation is the limited magnitude of the significant environmental differences, which may be too small to be effective. Another is that the relatively low density greatly reduces the likelihood of two worms coming into contact and competing for given resources. The continental slope may not be an ecotone, but ecotones may exist along its upper and lower boundaries. The existence of a shallow-water, zoogeographical barrier at Cape Hatteras is reaffirmed, but the role of currents on larval dispersal may be as important as temperature in maintaining this barrier. A barrier on the slope, maintained by the effect of the bottom currents on larval dispersion just south of Cape Hatteras (latitude 34°20'-34°30'N), is proposed. Three of the four ecological groupings of species fit into pre-existing zoogeographical provinces (Carolinian, Nova Scotian, and Abyssal Atlantic subarea), but a new province (Atlantic Transitional) is proposed for the slope. Sipunculans in the Virginian Province are extremely rare. Two pieces of evidence support the concept that abyssal, cold-water fauna is ancestral to the warmer, shallow-water fauna.

N2  - The geometrid moths heretofore assigned to the genera Nepterotaea McDunnough, Chesiadodes Hulst, and Morina Grossbeck (with its synonym Jenana Clarke) have been studied. The results indicate that only two generic categories are represented: Morina is therefore placed as a junior synonym of Chesiadodes. Both genera were revised. Nepterotaea now includes seven species, three of which are described as new; Chesiadodes contains 13, seven of which are new. These moths are found primarily in the semiarid southwestern United States, from western Texas to southeastern California. A few species occur outside of this area extending the range onto the Ozark Plateau in Missouri and Arkansas, and north in the Great Basin to central Oregon. Both genera are represented in northern Mexico, with records from Chihuahua and the peninsula of Baja California; the distribution is probably greater than this but not enough collecting has been done as yet in that country to give us the needed data. Both genera and all species, including their genitalia, are described; distributional information and time of flight are given for all species insofar as known. Keys are given for all species. The adults and their genitalia are illustrated.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 152
SP  - 255
N2  - The behavior of Asian woodpeckers is little known, although Asia is rich in woodpeckers, with as many as 13 species sympatric at a single locality (several places in lowland Malaya). Results of field studies conducted February to May, 1972, in India, Thailand, and Malaya are reported herein. New data on the habits, and especially the vocalizations of 29 species representing 14 genera (a fifteenth Asian genus, Sapheopipo, is discussed in a separate publication) compose the major portion of this treatise in which I discuss the following species: Picumnus innominatus, Sasia abnormis, Picoides moluccensis, P. canicapillus, P. macei, P. cathpharius, P. darjellensis, Celeus (Micropternus) brachyurus, Dryocopus javensis, Picus miniaceus, P. puniceus, P. chlorolophus, P. mentalis, P. flavinucha, P. vittatus (including viridamus), P. squamatus, P. canus, Dinopium rafflesii, D. javanense, Chrysocolaptes lucidus, Gecinulus viridis, Blythipicus rubiginosus, B. pyrrhotis, Reinwardtipicus (Chrysocolaptes) validus, Meiglyptes tukki, M. tristis, Hemicircus concretus, H. canente, and Mulleripicus pulverulentus. Aspects of their biology treated include foraging modes, foraging sites, displays, vocalizations and instrumental signals, breeding behavior, and habitat preference. More than 100 vocalizations and instrumental signals are described, mostly based on analysis of tape recordings. For the first time the nesting of Dinopium rafflesii is reported. Interspecific behavior is documented for various species, including competitive interactions between Picoides canicapillus and P. macei, between Picus miniaceus and P. puniceus, and between Dryocopus javensis and Mulleripicus pulverulentus. Behavioral comparisons are made on a worldwide basis, but taxonomic implications of behavior are discussed elsewhere. A brief discussion section focuses on ecological aspects of the species studied, in particular those of variations in size, with respect to sympatry, allopatry, and ant-foraging habits.

Scanning electron microscopy revealed many morphological and developmental details distinguishing the species and higher taxa. Distribution records in Hawaiian waters show isolation not only at the specific level from the Indo-Pacific and coastal eastern Pacific but also inter-island isolation due to unknown environmental factors.

T1  - The systematics of Rhadinaea (Colubridae), a genus of New World snakes.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 153
SP  - 1
N2  - The genus Rhadinaea contains 45 species of small to medium-sized snakes that dwell on the American mainland between latitudes 35° North (Cape Hatteras, North Carolina) and 35° South (east-central Argentina), from sea level to 3200 meters of elevation. Most species seem to be diurnal foragers of the forest floor, although several are probably highly secretive and even semifossorial; they feed principally on amphibians and lizards. The primary habitats and routes of dispersal are pine-oak woodlands and cloud forests of Mexico and upper Central America and humid, tropical broadleaf forests, including montane and lowland rain forests. The generic limits are vague, in part because characters customarily utilized in distinguishing snake genera break down within single species of Rhadinaea. A variety of morphological information is useful in the taxonomy of Rhadinaea, but species can largely be identified on the basis of color pattern, and the hemipenis proves to be a particularly important source of clues to intergeneric and intrageneric relationships. Underwood's recent expansion of the Natricidae to include Rhadinaea and allied genera is not accepted as a natural arrangement, and the genus is retained in the family Colubridae. Eight species groups are recognized, primarily on the basis of characteristics of the hemipenis, color pattern, and maxillary dentition. The godmani group (11 species) has its ancestral homeland and center of dispersal in Nuclear Central America and is considered closest to the basic stock that gave rise to certain other species groups of Rhadinaea and to the genera Trimetopon and Coniophanes. One evolutionary trend seen within the godmani group is the reduction from 21 to 19 to 17 rows of dorsal scales. Rhadinaea godmani is shown to be an unexpectedly wide-ranging species with a disjunct distribution; the possibility of genetic interchange between this species and R. hemsteadae, on the Meseta Central of Chiapas, needs further investigation. The northern flavilata group (two species), perhaps derived from the old godmani group, is comprised of peripheral relicts and has been largely replaced by the more modern decorata (11 species) and taeniata (three species) groups. These three groups are confined to Mexico except for the isolated Rhadinaea flavilata in the southeastern United States and for Rhadinaea decorata, which ranges from east-central Mexico to northwestern Ecuador. The latter species exhibits remarkable geographic variation in the hemipenis and has acquired keeled scales, a new feature in the genus. The occurrence of secondary hybridization in the taeniata group is discussed, and the distinctive aemula is placed as a subspecies of Rhadinaea taeniata; R. t. aemula possibly evolved as a mimic of the opisthoglyphous Coniophanes piceivittis. The calligaster group includes a single, highly variable species in lower Central America and is of questionable derivation from the godmani group. The vermiculaticeps group (three species) is confined to lower Central America and is probably derived from the godmani group. The hemipenis of species in the vermiculaticeps group is strikingly similar to that of the diminutive Rhadinaea schistosa, a godmani-group relict in Veracruz, Mexico, even to the presence of straight spines that were once thought to characterize the nominal genus Rhadinella. The origin of the lateristriga group (eight species) is obscure, but this group is possibly ancestral to Pliocercus, an evidently specialized genus of poisonous-snake mimics. Some specimens of Rhadinaea decipiens show an unexplained resemblance in color and pattern to nearly sympatric Rhadinaea calligaster, a species not closely related to the lateristriga group. Some specimens of the Central American Rhadinaea guentheri have shallow grooves on the posterior fangs; this species is closely related to congeners that lack grooves and represents an initial stage in the evolution of opisthoglyphy; a view that the grooved-fang condition is primitive and being lost in such groups is disputed. The brevirostris group (six species) is confined to South America. Hemipenial features and scale-row reduction of Rhadinaea brevirostris indicate close relationship between this Amazonian species and the more southern Rhadinaea occipitalis, which is unique in the genus in having acquired a color pattern of dark spots and the low number of 15 scale rows. Several species have had their center of evolution in or near the Brazilian highlands and show convergence in aspects of color pattern with species that have evolved in Mexico. The general tendency in modern Rhadinaea toward loss of bilobation of the hemipenis is well exemplified by the brevirostris group, in which all species have retained a split insertion of the major retractor muscle and in which the primitive bilobed condition still appears in the variational repertory of two species. There are few strict generic synonyms, because the species are sufficiently generalized to have permitted misassignment to a variety of named genera. The rediscovery of Calamaria dumerilii is reported; it was originally thought to be a Cuban species and is the type of the name Urotheca. The species is a distinct South American member of the lateristriga group, thus confirming Dunn's suggestion that the name Rhadinaea Cope, 1863, is a junior synonym of Urotheca Bibron '1843' (184-?). However, Rhadinaea is retained in the interest of nomenclatural stability, pending application for conservation to The International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. The names Taeniophallus Cope, 1895, and Rhadinella Smith, 1941, are considered to be junior subjective synonyms of Rhadinaea, and the emendation Rhadinaea Garman, 1883, is a junior objective synonym. Two new species, both in the decorata group, are described. Taxonomic innovations and changes in nomenclature are summarized in the concluding chapter.

T1  - Phylogeny and zoogeography of salmoniform fishes and relationships of Lepidogalaxias salamandroides.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 153
SP  - 267
N2  - The affinities of the tiny, freshwater Australian fish Lepidogalaxias salamandroides have remained uncertain since its original description in 1961. Comparisons of Lepidogalaxias with various salmoniforms, which it superficially resembles, uncovered a number of major problems in salmoniform taxonomy. A review of the anatomy of salmoniform gill arches, caudal skeletons, and secondary sexual characters suggests that Lepidogalaxias is an esocoid, that galaxiids and aplochitonids are related to salmonids (as salmonoids), and that retropinnids and prototroctids are related to osmerids, salangids, and plecoglossids (as osmeroids). A comparison of possible salmoniform phylogenies based on various anatomical features indicates that the phylogeny derived from gill arch evidence leads to the most economical hypothesis involving the fewest assumptions of independent origin of similar character states. The proposed phylogeny recognizes salmonoids and osmeroids (each as redefined to include parts of the former galaxioid assemblage) as sister groups. Argentinoids are considered a plesiomorph sister group of these two, and esocoids plus Lepidogalaxias the plesiomorph sister group of all other salmoniforms. Salmoniforms are amphitropical, panboreal, and panaustral in distribution and their worldwide and southern hemisphere distributions correspond partly or wholly with those of chironomid midges, southern beech trees (Nothofagus), and other plant groups. Alternative biogeographic interpretations of these distributions are considered: chance dispersal over uninhabitable gaps in relation to the present continental landscape versus an original and ancient Pangaean distribution followed by continental drift. Waif dispersal hypotheses are found to be aprioristic, wanting in evidence, highly imaginative, and untestable, whereas the continental drift model simply and directly accounts for the present distributions of varied organisms with different mobilities and other biological properties. Acceptability of the continental drift model would place the minimum age of the main groups of salmoniforms at 180 million years and of some of the southern assemblages at 90 million years. Reasons for rejecting the concepts of primary and secondary division freshwater fishes as applied to the solution to zoogeographic problems are given. A return to the concepts of continental and oceanic fish groups is advocated, the zoogeographic interpretations of which are determined not by what we imagine to be the habits of the fishes and their possible dispersal mechanisms but by their distributions in relation to phylogeny and in relation to the distributions of other organisms.

T1  - Parallel evolution in early trigoniacean bivalves.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 154
SP  - 55
N2  - The present work is a morphologic-taxonomic revision and inquiry into the evolution of geologically ancient (late Paleozoic and Triassic) marine bivalves of a formerly cosmopolitan superfamily Trigoniacea that are represented today by a single Australian genus Neotrigonia. Trigoniaceans, after a very long period of extreme conservatism, underwent a notable radiation in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, then nearly became extinct immediately afterward. Particular attention is devoted here to stratigraphic-morphologic analysis from which it is concluded that the complex hinge of the younger genera probably is of diverse origin as apparently it was attained after divergence of separate lines. Each line is characterized by chronological propinquity of relatively stable surface markings and external form. The modified taxonomic arrangement adopted here recognizes the polyphyletic attainment of the derived hinge characters shared in common by the most advanced genera of trigoniaceans. It results in improved resolution of phylogenetic and biostratigraphic problems as contrasted with the more generalized conventional 'horizontal' scheme of classification. Much of the memoir reports our original observations on morphologic details and anatomy of living and fossil trigoniaceans from Australia, Europe, and America and attempts a taxonomic revision of 27 North American Upper Carboniferous and Permian species. New families introduced here are the: Eoschizodidae, Eoastartidae, and Costatoriidae. The following genera are given more than perfunctory attention: Devonian only: Eoschizodus, Rhenania, Hefteria; Devonian to Permian: Schizodus; Permian only: Heteroschizodus, new genus, Lyroschizodus, new genus, Procostatoria, new genus, Paraschizodus, new genus, Scaphellina, Eoastarte, and Kaibabella; both Permian and Triassic: Neoschizodus and Costatoria; Triassic only: Heminajas, Pachycardia, Trigonodus, Gruenewaldia, Lyriomyophoria, and Costatoria.

T1  - A zoogeographic analysis of the South American chaco avifauna.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 154
SP  - 165
N2  - The South American chaco is centrally situated on the border of the tropics and is xeric-adapted woodland with some open areas, wet places, and savanna. Driest in the center and wettest in the eastern pantanal savanna, the chaco experiences occasional frost throughout. About 409 avian species, including 22 that barely reach its borders, are resident or breed in the chaco. These number 218 nonpasserine birds, 100 suboscine passerines, including 52 tyrant flycatchers, 20 oscine passerines of Old World groups, and 71 New World nine-primaried oscines. Each species is treated taxonomically (based on a systematic reappraisal of each taxon), ecologically, and distributionally. There seem to be more superspecies in the chaco and in the tropics generally than in temperate North America. Most chaco species (252) are endemic in South America, but 28 percent reach Middle America, 12 percent attain North America, and 3 percent reach the Old World. A transatlantic distributional history is possible for as many as one-seventh the number of chaco species reaching North America. Only one species (Eudromia formosa) is endemic to the chaco; 11 others mainly occupy that area; five subspecies are endemic. Such low endemicity reflects the central location and accessibility of the chaco, and probably rather drastic historical changes in its extent and location. Major range disjunctions in chaco species and superspecies frequently involve northern South America, with Amazonia the apparent barrier. Isolates in the Andes and in the coastal Peru region are fewer, but well differentiated. The caatinga is another area of differentiation. Zones of avian interaction (70) and narrow range disjunctions (28) involving chaco birds show isolates and former isolates mainly in southeastern Brazil, in the campo-caatinga region, and in the Andes, indicating that barriers (e.g., grassland, water) exist or formerly existed between the paired forms. Significantly more nine-primaried oscines and fewer nonpasserine birds show interactions and narrow disjunctions compared with proportions of these species in the chaco avifauna. This perhaps reflects greater speciation and radiation in the nine-primaried oscines, a group still relatively new to southern South America. Primary intergradation in the 276 polytypic chaco species indicates the coincidence of racial borders with major environmental features such as the Amazon and Paraguay rivers, and with certain regions (campo cerrado, Andean base). Major size differences among races of 81 chaco species generally agree (69 cases) with Bergmann's Ecogeographic Rule, larger forms occurring south of smaller races. The chaco avifauna largely is derived from elsewhere, particularly from other xeric regions, savanna formations and edges or ecotones involving forested regions. The chaco nevertheless has been important in furthering range extension and the ultimate isolation of some xeric-adapted birds and species favoring edges and ecotones. There is a need for further in-depth taxonomic-zoogeographic investigations of particular Neotropical avian groups and regional South American zoogeographic analyses.

T1  - Bats of the Sudan.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 154
SP  - 355
N2  - A revision of the species of bats (Chiroptera) occurring in the Republic of the Sudan (the former Anglo-Egyptian Sudan) is presented. Sixty-six species are definitely recognized as occurring within the boundaries of the country, whereas some 38 others are known from nearby areas and may cross its borders. All eight of the widespread Old World families are represented. Most of the Sudan lies within the Ethiopian region but a relatively small area in the north is best allocated to the arid southwestern Palearctic. The bat fauna is grouped into nine ecogeographical categories (forest, forest-savanna, savanna, east African, desert, savanna-Palearctic, desert-Palearctic, Palearctic, and unclassified), and the Sudanese distribution of the species in each category is summarized. A number of interesting taxonomic problems are discussed, but the final resolution of most of them will involve analysis outside the Sudan.

N2  - The 26 new World species of Gnaphosa are diagnosed, described, and assigned to species groups. The genus Cylphosa Chamberlin is considered a junior synonym of Gnaphosa; the genera Callilepis Westring and Laronia Simon are removed from the Gnaphosinae. Nine new species are described: snohomish from Washington; maritima, saxosa, dentata, and salsa from the southwestern United States; and sonora, chihuahua, potosi and chiapas from Mexico. Seven specific names are newly synonymized: mulaiki Chamberlin and septentrionalis Fox, both with clara (Keyserling); subparvula Fox with mima Chamberlin; gosoga Chamberlin with californica Banks; distincta Banks and texana Chamberlin, both with fontinalis Keyserling; and peon Chamberlin with sericata (L. Koch). The males of utahana Banks, altudona Chamberlin, and sandersi Gertsch and Davis, and the female of orites Chamberlin are described for the first time. The European species microps Holm is newly recorded from America.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 155
SP  - 243
N2  - Pseudopsis is redescribed, a key to the species is presented, and the phylogeny, distributional history, and biology of the species are discussed. Of the 30 species in the genus five are redescribed, 24 are newly described, and one, P. columbica, is resurrected from synonymy with P. sulcata, but was not studied. Pseudopsis montoraria is proposed to replace what mistakenly has been called P. obliterata. The true P. obliterata and P. detrita are synonyms, the former taking priority. What was previously the geographically widespread P. sulcata is a complex of 24 sibling species. The new species of the P. sulcata complex in the Old World are P. afra, P. himalayensis, P. prolixa, and P. watanabei. In the new World the complex is represented by the newly described P. subulata, P. sagitta, P. obtusa, P. callosa, P. abbreviata, P. sinuata, P. echinata, P. maja, P. spicula, P. bilacuna, P. biloba, P. constricta, P. vespina, P. lata, P. dybasi, P. petila, P. dilata, P. grossa, and P. wygodzinskyi. Pseudopsis sulcata (sensu stricto) occurs in the western Palaearctic region. Most species of the complex are allopatric, but nine occur sympatrically, three at one locality, and two at each of three other places. Pseudopsis is the only genus of the Pseudopsinae and is the sister group of the Oxytelinae. Two subgenera are recognized: Pseudopsis and Pseudopsiella. Chiliopseudopsis is a junior synonym of Pseudopsiella. The nominal subgenus contains the 25 species of the sulcata complex. Pseudopsis obliterata, P. montoraria, P. minuta, P. arrowi, and P. adustipennis comprise Pseudopsiella. Pseudopsis and Pseudopsiella are sister groups. Within Pseudopsiella, P. minuta is the sister species of the other four species. Pseudopsis obliterata and P. montoraria are the sister group to P. arrowi and P. adustipennis. Alternative phylogenetic schemes are discussed. The species of the genus live principally in temperate, montane regions of the world. They probably originated in western North America and spread from there.

T1  - The natural history of nyala, Tragelaphus angasi (Mammalia, Bovidae) in Mozambique.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 155
SP  - 321
N2  - We made observations of nyala (Tragelaphus angasi) for more than 2000 man-hours primarily between September, 1971, and April, 1974, in Zinave National park, Mozambique, and vicinity, mostly in a study area of approximately 32 sq. km., near Zinave Camp on the Save River. Data on habitat, climate, measurements, and age and growth of nyala are presented. In the study area 70 percent of the adults seen were females. The population of nyala in the study area increased from an estimated 175 to 250 in 1971 to more than 326 in 1973, for a density of about 10 nyala per sq. km. More than 60 percent of the nyala seen were adults. Nyala were seen alone or in groups up to 30 in number; 67 percent of the observations were of one to three animals. Males were seen alone twice as frequently as females. Nyala groups are not permanent, and individuals come and go. A subadult male was seen in association with at least 15 other individuals and an immature with 16 in eight and 13 days respectively. The strongest bond is probably between a mother and her young, but newborn nyala are left hidden in thickets for several weeks. The home range of male nyala is up to 10 sq. km., and does not change seasonally. The home range of females is approximately the same size. No evidence of territoriality has been observed, and there is extensive overlap of home ranges of males and females. Nyala are active in the daytime especially at temperatures between 20° C. and 30° C. and at night during the rainy season. They shelter from both sun and cold in thickets and at Zinave drink daily. In the dry season when food is less available nyala may wander 12 km. between sunup and sundown. Lions and leopards are the main predators of adult nyala, whereas baboons and raptorial birds are the principal predators of juveniles. Nyala are killed by man for trophies and meat. Nyala have a single offspring born after an eight and one-half month gestation period at any time of the year. Females may conceive within a week after parturition. Nyala are often seen in association with impala or baboons. Nyala eat leaves, fruits, flowers, twigs, and bark of more than a hundred species of plants. They are parasitized by ticks, flies, trypanosomes, and helminths. The social behavior of nyala is shown mainly by male displays and rituals for assertion of dominance without fighting. A hypothesis of the communicatory role of the white markings of nyala is presented.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 155
SP  - 389
N2  - Shared derived characters of the basicranium provide the basis for a new theory of relationships and a new classification of the major groups of living and extinct turtles. Post-Triassic turtles are characterized by a jaw-closing mechanism where the main adductor tendon rides over a trochlea, a condition unique among vertebrates. A study of the trochlear mechanism and associated basicranial adaptations for akinesis suggests that the trochlea evolved independently in cryptodires and pleurodires. Cranial arteries and the canals and foramina associated with them provide characters used to develop hypotheses of relationships among the Cryptodira. The taxon 'Amphichelydia,' characterized by primitive features and supposedly containing the ancestors of recent turtles, is rejected and its members distributed to monophyletic taxa.

T1  - Stratigraphy of the Box Butte Formation, Nebraska.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 156
SP  - 1
N2  - Sedimentary deposits of northwestern Nebraska formerly assigned to the Box Butte Member of the Sheep Creek Formation are redefined as the Box Butte Formation, new rank. Two new members are proposed: the Red Valley Member, new name, the lower unit; and the Dawes Clay Member, new name, paraconformably overlying it. Type localities, type sections, and a series of reference sections are proposed for each new or redefined unit. Deposits assigned to the two members of the Box Butte Formation crop out in irregular exposures, some of which occur in well-defined paleovalleys in an area covering nearly 900 square miles situated high along the rims and ridges of tablelands forming the northern border of the High Plains. Sediments of the Red Valley Member are red siltstones or clayey siltstones predominantly, with occasional sandstone lenses or admixtures of sand. Coarser clasts are confined to the bottom and sides of paleovalleys and are mostly small cobble- or pebble-sized sandstone concretions reworked from the underlying Runningwater Formation = Upper Marsland Formation.¹ The Red Valley Member occurs only in paleovalleys, which are narrow and steep-walled on the more westerly outcrops, but widen to a few hundred yards along the easterly exposures and are incised as much as 140 feet into the Runningwater. White to gray, hard, nodular calcareous concretions are the most distinctive lithologic feature of the Dawes Clay Member; they are conspicuously absent in the Red Valley Member. The Dawes Clay Member commonly is 25 to 30 feet thick but may range from 20 to 40 feet. It crops out as a distinctive set of mottled reddish and greenish clayey siltstones on which the characteristic white calcareous nodules may be concentrated at certain horizons. Where the Red Valley Member is absent, the Dawes Clay lies unconformably on the Runningwater Formation, and on most outcrops it is in contact with the Platy Bench, a topographic feature formed at several levels in the upper part of the Runningwater. In western Dawes, western Box Butte, and eastern Sioux counties, the Dawes Clay Member is overlain by beds correlated with the Sand Canyon Member of the Sheep Creek Formation. Mammalian fossils collected in the Box Butte Formation show that the formation was deposited earlier than the earliest beds of the Sheep Creek Formation and later than any beds assigned to the Runningwater Formation; thus the Box Butte was deposited during a segment of time heretofore not recognized formally in the Nebraska geologic section. 1. The term Runningwater Formation = Marsland Formation is used here to direct attention to the existence of two formational names that currently are being applied to the same set of beds. Until clarification of the status of the beds is published, proponents of either of the terms are advised to read Runningwater Formation = Marsland Formation whenever Runningwater Formation appears in the present report.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 156
SP  - 71
N2  - The Bistonini is a relatively small, compact group of geometrid moths found in the Holarctic region. In the New World they occur in Alaska, Canada, and the United States, and there is one known record from the State of Chihuahua, Mexico. The Nearctic species are placed in six genera; four of these also occur in the Old World. A total of 22 species are represented in our fauna; Cochisea undulata (Arizona), C. paula (California), C. unicoloris (California), C. recisa (California), and C. curva (California) are described as new. Keys to the genera and species are given, as are illustrations of the adults, their genitalia, and maps of their distribution. Some members of the tribe, including species of Biston and Phigalia for example, have melanic forms: these have been studied for 'industrial melanism.' At times some species are of economic importance as defoliators of woodlands and shade trees. Neither of these facets is covered intensively, as the present paper is intended as a revisionary study. However, I have included a number of references to these two fields of interest in order to call attention to their presence in the appropriate species. The possible phylogeny and distribution of the tribe is discussed, with the relationships of the New and Old World faunas being covered. A number of different morphological characters are treated, with some assigned as either primitive or derived. Three characters are presented that apparently were not known for the North American Geometridae. These are the presence of hairy eyes in Biston and Cochisea and the progressive reduction and loss of both the fore tibial process and the tympanic organs in the brachypterous and wingless females.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 156
SP  - 159
N2  - The taxonomy and analyses of the phylogenetic relationships and adaptations of the subfamilies Anaptomorphinae, Omomyinae, and Ekgmowechashalinae of the undoubted tarsiiform family Omomyidae are presented. The exclusively European subfamily Microchoerinae, although best referred to the Omomyidae, is not revised; pertinent information is treated in the study of phylogenetic ties of the family. The Omomyidae, as far as is known, is Holarctic in distribution. The known stratigraphic ranges are: Anaptomorphinae, early to medial Eocene (North America and Europe); Omomyinae, early Eocene to early Oligocene (North America; early Eocene in Asia); Ekgmowechashalinae, late Oligocene (North America); Microchoerinae, medial Eocene to early Oligocene (Europe). Character analysis of the primarily dental, cranial, and postcranial evidence is presented. Several derived character states, particularly the relative size and point of entry of the intrabullar carotid circulation, unequivocally tie the Omomyidae to the Tarsiidae and also to the Platyrrhini and Catarrhini, thus helping to substantiate the monophyletic status of the suborder Haplorhini, as contrasted with the suborder Strepsirhini. The origin of the Omomyidae, the most primitive known family of the Tarsiiformes, was probably from a primitive lemuriform primate that most closely resembled a member of the Eocene Adapidae. The classification presented is a compromise based on morphological diversity and phylogeny, but it is consistent with the inferred phylogeny. Family Omomyidae: Subfamily Anaptomorphinae: Tribe Anaptomorphini; Subtribe Teilhardinina; Teilhardina; Chlororhysis -- Subtribe Anaptomorphina; Anaptomorphus -- Subtribe Tetoniina; Tetonius; Anemorhysis; Absarokius; Mckennamorphus, new genus -- Tribe Trogoleniurini, new; Trogolemur. Subfamily Omomyinae: Tribe Omomyini; Subtribe Omomyina; Omomys; Chumashius -- Subtribe Mytoniina, new rank; Ourayia; Macrotarsius -- Tribe Washakiini, new; Loveina; Shoshonius; Washakius; Dyseolemur; Hemiacodon -- Tribe Uintaniini, new; Uintanius -- Tribe Utahiini, new; Utahia; Stockia -- Tribe Rooneyiini, new; Rooneyia. Subfamily Ekgmowechashalinae, new: Ekgmowechashala. Family and suborder uncertain: Donrussellia, new genus.

T1  - Surface structure of fossil and Recent epidermal scales from North American lizards of the genus Sceloporus (Reptilia, Iguanidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 156
SP  - 453
N2  - More than 2000 fossil epidermal scales from lizards of the genus Sceloporus have been found in the American Southwest (Arizona, California, Nevada) in 35 fossil packrat (Neotoma) middens, ranging in age from 21,700 [plus or minus] 500 to 2720 [plus or minus] 100 radiocarbon years. We compared the surface structure (using a scanning electron microscope), dimensions, and shapes of the fossil scales with scales from seven Recent species of Sceloporus (S. occidentalis, S. undulatus, S. graciosus, S. jarrovii, S. orcutti, S. clarkii, and S. magister). Our objective was to identify the species of Sceloporus represented by the fossil scales, with a view to improving our understanding of the communities that formerly inhabited the fossil localities. In addition, we discovered several fossil scales that are referable to Sauromalus obesus, Crotaphytus, and Cnemidophorus. Controlled observations demonstrate that the scales of the seven Recent species we examined have rather similar surface micro-ornamentation, as do the fossils. Such specific differences as do exist are subtle and difficult to resolve on most of the fossils. Work with living and preserved S. occidentalis and S. undulatus revealed extreme intraspecific variation in scale surface ornamentation that is correlated with the shedding cycle. Scale surfaces that are newly exposed upon molting are highly ornamented with spinules, pits, and partitions that represent superficial cell boundaries. This ornamentation disappears or deteriorates drastically in time, but reappears after the animal molts. This extreme variation must be accounted for in making interspecific comparisons. The most reliable method for studying surface micro-ornamentation on Sceloporus scales is to work with living captives and examine their newly exposed scale surfaces immediately following molting. Burstein, Larsen, and Smith (1974) proposed that certain characteristics of surface micro-ornamentation of Sceloporus scales may be very useful in systematics at lower levels of the taxonomic hierarchy and are unidirectional in evolution; they also concluded which traits represent primitive character-states. These authors, however, worked strictly with scales from preserved specimens, and they did not properly account for variation. Our direct comparisons of shed scales with newly exposed scale surfaces obtained concurrently from the same living individuals demonstrate that many of the character-states utilized by these authors are nothing more than differences that normally appear on a single scale at different periods in the shedding cycle. Examination of gross features revealed that, when isolated, certain scales with distinctive morphology (dimensions, shapes) are useful for distinguishing among the seven Recent species, but even at best their utility is limited. Small scales cannot be identified with certainty because most of the small scales on large lizards cannot be distinguished readily from the larger scales on small lizards. Certain large scales can be determined as not having been deposited by the smaller species if the sizes and shapes of the scales clearly exceed the maximum limits observed on the smaller species. Thus, gross morphology can be used to limit the number of candidate species represented by certain large scales in a given sample of fossils, and in some instances geographic distribution is useful to limit the possibilities further. The scales in 11 samples of fossils were such that we could not confidently identify the species of Sceloporus they represented. However, 24 samples ranging in age from 9770 [plus or minus] 160 to 17,610 [plus or minus] 290 radiocarbon years, from Coconino, Mohave, and Yuma counties, Arizona, and from San Bernardino County, California, contained large scales that probably were deposited by Sceloporus magister, which is found today at or very near each of the fossil localities. Sceloporus magister, and some other species of reptiles (Sauromalus obesus, Gopherus agassizi) whose remains have been found in some of the same fossil pack-rat middens, occur primarily in desert and chaparral communities today. However, plant fossils from the same deposits suggest that in the Pleistocene these reptiles occurred often in relatively mesic woodland in which the lowest winter temperatures were not very different from those at the same sites today, but in which summer temperatures were cooler than those prevailing today. Scale functions are discussed briefly. We suspect that one of the important functions of the large, keeled, spinose and imbricating scales of Sceloporus, and possibly of their micro-ornamentation, is to provide the proper surface contact with the environment, particularly in regard to friction. This scutellation may be particularly advantageous to lizards that seek shelter from predators in deep crevices among rocks and vegetation, where efficient entry into cover and the ability to cling there may be enhanced by the structure of the scales.

N2  - A Lower Triassic (Sulphur Mountain Formation) marine fossil fish assemblage from the Wapiti Lake area, British Columbia, is described. It includes the following taxa: cf. Palaeobates, Chondrichthyes, incertae sedis, Pteronisculus sp., Birgeria sp., Boreosomus sp., Bobasatrania canadensis, cf. Perleidus, Australosomus sp., Saurichthys sp., Parasemionotidae, incertae sedis, Albertonia cupidinia, and Whiteia sp. Most of these forms, or close relatives, are also known from the marine Lower Triassic rocks of East Greenland, Spitzbergen, and Madagascar. Although the Wapiti Lake specimens have not added significantly to our knowledge of the morphology and systematics of marine Scythian fishes, the assemblage has helped us understand their paleozoogeographic distribution around the periphery of Pangaea.

T1  - A fourth Neotropical species of synbranchid eel and the phylogeny and systematics of synbranchiform fishes.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 157
SP  - 1
N2  - The discovery of an undescribed species of synbranchiform eel, with populations in the Atlantic slope of Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba, and northeastern South America, presented problems in its taxonomic assignment that required a review of the genera and higher groups within the order. Analyses of superficial anatomy, skull, and vertebral column, but particularly of the detailed structure of the hyoid, gill arch, and branchial vascular systems indicated that some of the groups of synbranchiform species are paraphyletic and others polyphyletic, and that the Alabetidae, long associated with the swamp eels, should be excluded from the assemblage. A phylogenetic hypothesis is put forward that divides all synbranchiforms (treated here as the single family Synbranchidae) into two lineages: the Macrotreminae (containing only Macrotrema caligans) and the Synbranchinae (including three genera: Ophisternon (containing the species bengalense, gutturale, candidum, afrum, infernale, and the new neotropical form aenigmaticum), Synbranchus (containing marmoratus and madeirae), Monopterus (containing albus, boueti, cuchia, fossorius, and two forms originally described under the name indicus)). The generic names Furmastix and Anomatophasma are placed in the synonymy of Ophisternon, and Typhlosynbranchus and Amphipnous are placed in the synonymy of Monopterus. The nomenclatural histories of the genera and some species are discussed and an analytical key to the subfamilies, genera, and species is provided.

N2  - In the present paper, the second of a three part series on Bledius, the armatus, basalis, and melanocephalus groups from the Nearctic region are discussed. In addition to a revised key to the species groups of the New World, illustrations, keys, diagnoses and distributional and habitat data are presented for each species. Bledius notialus, B. aquilonarius, and B. thinopus are newly described. Bledius cuspidatus Le Conte, B. agonus Casey, B. tenuis Casey, and B. nelsoni Hatch are new junior synonyms of B. flavipennis Le Conte. Bledius lectus Casey, B. piceus Fall, B. specularis Fall, B. regularis Fall, and B. condonensis Hatch are new junior synonyms of B. opacifrons Le Conte. Bledius nigriceps Notman is a new junior synonym of B. politus Erichson. Bledius gradatus Fall and B. boddyi Hatch are new junior synonyms of B. eximius Casey. Bledius arizonensis Fall is a new junior synonym of B. strenuus Casey. Bledius ignavus Casey and B. misellus Casey are new junior synonyms of B. basalis Le Conte. Bledius confinus Fall is a new junior synonym of B. melanocephalus (Say). Bledius melanocephalus (Say), the only species in the melanocephalus group, is recognized and discussed for the first time in more than 150 years. Bledius cordatus (Say), B. basalis Le Conte, B. turbulentus Casey, B. dimidiatus Le Conte, B. opaculus Le Conte, B. neglectus Casey, and B. thinopus, new species, comprise the basalis group and, but for B. dimidiatus, all live on the coast of eastern North America. The armatus group includes B. flavipennis Le Conte, B. nitidiceps Le Conte, B. opacifrons Le Conte, B. ineptus Casey, B. consimilis Fall, B. monstratus Casey, B. fenyesi Bernhauer and Schubert, B. politus Erichson, B. episcopalis Fall, B. eximius Casey, B. bellicus Blackwelder, B. strenuus Casey, B. aquilonarius, new species, and B. notialus, new species. All species of the armatus group except B. politus live principally west of the Mississippi River.

T1  - Preliminary evaluation of skin toxins and vocalizations in taxonomic and evolutionary studies of poison-dart frogs (Dendrobatidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 157
SP  - 175
N2  - Studies in progress reveal at least three novel classes of toxic alkaloids in skin secretions of Neotropical dendrobatid frogs. Batrachotoxins are characterized by a steroidal ring structure; those batrachotoxins having a pyrrole carboxylate substituent are among the most toxic of nonprotein poisons. Pumiliotoxins are less toxic and poorly known, but pumiliotoxins A and B appear to have a bicyclic ring system with differing side chains; pumiliotoxin C is a simple cis-decahydroquinoline. Histrionicotoxins have an unusual spiro-ring system and both 4-carbon and 5-carbon side chains, on the cyclohexane and piperidine rings, respectively. Structures are uncertain for other alkaloids of lower molecular weight, but some appear structurally related to pumiliotoxins and others to histrionicotoxins. Methods of study include thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography, electron impact and chemical ionization mass spectrometry, and quantitative mass spectrometry. Combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry gives reproducible results for small-sample taxonomic comparisons of frogs containing pumiliotoxins, histrionicotoxins, and similar alkaloids. Limitations of molecular data in taxonomic and evolutionary studies are considered. Biochemical and other variation are analyzed in Dendrobates histrionicus, a rain-forest frog of western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. Sexual dimorphism is slight, and geographic variation in body size appears correlated with climate. There are geographic differences in relative tibia length and in escape behavior. Interpopulational differences in color and color pattern are extreme, and intrapopulational variation also may be considerable. Most colorations are thought to be aposematic, but highly variable frogs of one population seem cryptically colored. Dendrobates histrionicus elaborates histrionicotoxins and lower molecular-weight alkaloids; one population sample had trace amounts of a higher molecular-weight compound, tentatively identified as pumiliotoxin B. Southern populations produce large amounts of histrionicotoxins and lesser amounts of lower weight alkaloids, a situation reversed in most northern populations. Individual populations have 8-10 of 19 alkaloids detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Alkaloid similarity comparisons show that most populations share more compounds with near than with distant populations; a geographically intermediate population shares as many or more alkaloids with distant as with neighboring populations. Analysis of geographic variation in skin toxins supports the notion of conspecificity of most histrionicus-like frogs, but different spectra of toxins revealed two additional sibling species. These new species resemble D. histrionicus in morphology (including absence of omosternum), vocalizations, and type of male aggressiveness; and their color patterns, although distinctive, are approached in the variation of histrionicus. Dendrobates lehmanni, new species, lacks histrionicotoxins and produces pumiliotoxins and other alkaloids not detected in histrionicus; it is a black frog with crossbands of vivid orange or orange-red. Dendrobates lehmanni was known for years only from specimens sold in the animal trade, but its habitat is traced to a restricted area of montane forest in the Río Anchicayá drainage of the western Andes, Department of Valle, Colombia. Dendrobates occultator, new species, shows greater biochemical resemblance to histrionicus, but shared alkaloid similarity values are relatively low, and it produces significant amounts of pumiliotoxins and only two kinds of histrionicotoxins (5-7 kinds in populations of histrionicus). Dendrobates occultator is a red-backed frog with yellow lateral spots; it occurs in the Pacific lowlands, in the upper Río Saija drainage, Department of Cauca, Colombia, where it is sympatric with a population of histrionicus. Both lehmanni and occultator may have speciated from geographical isolates of histrionicus; it is suggested that some character divergence might have occurred after the range of occultator was rejoined with the parent species. Dendrobates viridis, new species, is also described, as it occurs sympatrically with the other two new species and evidently has an extensive range in Pacific-side Colombia, along the western flank of the Andes. It is a miniature, uniformly green frog, whose skin secretions include pumiliotoxins. Species of Dendrobates in Central America and northwestern South America seem characterized by either of two kinds of vocalizations, which correlate with calling behavior and type of aggressiveness. Buzz calls are a nearly uniform series of pulses, which are produced too fast for resolution by the human ear but which can be directly visualized on sound spectrograms made with a wide-band filter. Buzz calls are given by D. auratus and D. minutus (and 'Phyllobates' espinosai), species that call relatively infrequently and which seem relatively unaggressive. Chirp calls are trains of harsh, poorly modulated notes, in which pulses are produced too fast for resolution on wide-band sound spectrograms. Chirp calls are given by D. granuliferus, D. histrionicus, D. lehmanni, D. occultator, D. pumilio, and D. speciosus -- all of which are characterized by nearly incessant calling from perches, and by pronounced male aggressiveness related to territorial defense. Geographic variation in normal and aggressive calls suggests that D. pumilio may actually be a composite of two species, but biochemical and other variation have yet to be investigated.

N2  - One. Changes in relative humidity have no marked effect on the length of pupal period of Drosophila ampelophila. 2. Changes in relative humidity produce striking changes in the mortality of Drosophila, the mortality increasing with a decrease of humidity. The optimum humidity being 100 per cent. 3. The effects of low humidity on mortality are most marked with very young pupae, whose covering permits a rapid evaporation of body moisture. After a few hours, when integumental changes making evaporation more difficult have set in, the effects of low humidity are correspondingly decreased.

N2  - To sum up the writer's conclusions from the material examined: Vomer and Selene are both derivatives of Caranx through Hynnis, and all four genera separable. Three valid forms of Vomer exist, as differentiated by Jordan and Evermann on variation in depth and fin rays: dorsalis, setapinnis, and cubensis (= gabonensis J. and E., not of Guich.). There is great age variation in depth and considerable individual variation in fin rays. The three forms are close and probably overlap in characters, rather than in ranges to the extent supposed by earlier authors; though, as their migrations, aided by ocean currents, are considerable, this is not certain. Dorsalis is the west African form; setapinnis, American, both Atlantic and Pacific; cubensis West Indian (Cuba). The three should stand as subspecies of setapinnis. Pacific V. s. setapinnis differs slightly but not recognizably from that of the Atlantic.

N2  - The more important stratigraphic results may be summarized as follows: 1. Separation of the pre-Puerco beds into several members which are, in descending order, a heavy conglomeratic sandstone with much fossil wood, a series of clays with channel sandstones, a conglomerate and a series of dove-colored clays, red-banded near the top. The two conglomeratic members have disconformities at their bases. Dinosaurs occur, especially at two levels separated by the lower conglomerate. More or less of this series of beds may be correlateable with the Animas formation. 2. Complete confirmation of Barnum Brown's observation regarding the unconformable relationship of the Puerco with respect to the conglomeratic sandstone with fossil logs on which it rests. A topography in low relief was developed on the surface of this sandstone previous to the deposition of the Puerco clays, which cover up these hills and valleys. 3. Accurate location of the two Puerco fossil levels and demonstration of the fact that Polymastodon is confined to the uppermost of the two levels. For their position see sections A and B, Fig. 2. 4. Measurement of the thickness of the Puerco on continuous exposures from the unconformity at its base to the level of the first occurrence of Torrejon fossils. 5. Discovery of fossil plants in the Puerco. 6. Accumulation of data which seem to prove the fluviatile origin of the Puerco sediments. 7. Discovery of a new fossil horizon in the Torrejon, 100 feet below the horizon from which fossils had hitherto been obtained. 8. Finding of Torrejon fossils at still lower levels (see sections). 9. Location of the Torrejon levels with reference to those of the Puerco (see actions A and B, Fig. 2). 10. Correlation of the Rio Puerco and Arroyo Torrejon sections published by Dr. Gardner of the U.S. Geological Survey with the sections measured by the American Museum party. 11. Accumulation of data which seem to prove the fluviatile origin of the Torrejon sediments.

N2  - 1. The Wind River Basin is covered throughout the greater part of its area with beds of the Wind River group, pertaining to the Lambdotherium zone. 2. Mammalian remains are extremely rare or absent from these beds except in two localities in the northern and northeastern part of the basin, viz., along Alkali Creek and between Muddy Creek and the Owl Creek Mountains. 3. Lying alone the northern border of the Tertiary deposits in the northeastern corner of the basin, between the foot hills and the Lambdotherium beds, apparently older than the latter and with the best exposures along Cottonwood Creek, is a series of strata of 350 feet or more, containing a fauna intermediate between the Lambdotherium zone and the Coryphodon zone of the Big Horn Wasatch, the genera being all common to both zones. 4. Along the southern border of the basin, on the divide between Sweetwater River and Beaver Creek, there is exposed a thickness of 1,100 feet of Tertiary, a remnant of deposits which undoubtedly extended over a large part of the basin at one time. Three distinct faunal levels, as indicated by mammalian fossils, are exhibited, Lower Eocene, Upper Eocene, and Lower Oligocene, the levels being correlated with (1) the ?Coryphodon Zone of the Wasatch, (2) the ?Diplacodon Zone of the Uinta, and (3) the Titanotherium Zone of the White River. An unconformity exists between the Eocene and Oligocene, but no break in sedimentation was detected in the Eocene series. 5. Between the Coryphodon and Diplacodon levels are several hundred feet of unfossiliferous beds, the lower part of which pertain probably to the Lambdotherium zone of the Wind River group, and the upper part possibly to the Middle Eocene faunal zones of the Bridger Basin.

N2  - 1. The Lower Eocene sediments of the Bighorn Basin represent the alluvial filling of an intermontane trough of downwarp. 2. They have been transported from the surrounding mountains as shown by the lithology of the gravels, sands and clays. No volcanic ash occurs. 3. They are stream transported and have been deposited in stream channels or spread over flood plains. No evidence in favor of wind transportation has been observed. 4. The Eocene clays are banded in more or less regular alternation, red and blue. This may be due to climatic causes leading to concentration of iron salts and their oxidation. 5. The beds are divisible into three formations, the Knight, Lysite and Lost Cabin, readily separable by their fossils, but not differing lithologically and conformable throughout. The Wind River (comprising the Lysite and Lost Cabin) is confined to the southwest portion of the basin (McCulloch Peak possibly excepted) and has been removed elsewhere by erosion. 6. The Lower Eocene formations are overlain conformably by another set of beds, containing much lignite, the Tatman Formation, in which determinable vertebrate fossils have not yet been found. Invertebrate fossils suggest that it may be of Eocene age, possibly Bridger. 7. The Tatman Formation is overlain by andesitic gravels of doubtful age, of which but a remnant on the top of Tatman Mountain is preserved in place. 8. Deformative stresses have acted on the basin filling after the deposition of the Tatman formation, flexing it into marginal anticlines and synclines and increasing the centripetal dip of the beds. 9. The major dissection of the basin is, probably, a comparatively late event, geologically speaking, perhaps referable, in part, to the Pleistocene.

VL  - 119

N2  - The present study includes two superfamilies of aspidobranch gastropods from the Permian of the southwestern United States. These are the Bellerophontacea, an abundant group having primitive bilateral symmetry, and the Patellacea, a rare group showing superficial, secondary bilateral symmetry. Where possible, species described from Permian outcrops outside North America have been tentatively assigned to the genera studied. Species currently assigned to the Pennsylvanian genera of Bellerophontacea in North America have been briefly reviewed. This is the first published summary of the bellerophontacean species in 60 years. Following Knight's concept, I interpret the Bellerophontacea as being prosobranch gastropods. The slit suggests two gills, and phyletic considerations imply that these gills may have restricted them to a firm bottom in fairly clear water. The Recent Patellacea have a clinging habit, and there is strong suggestive evidence that the Permian species had a similar habit. The Permian Bellerophontacea do not show phyletic size increase through time. The size of Permian species shows no clear trends either in the fauna as a whole or in a few selected species studied in more detail. Size frequency distribution in nine samples suggests that the occasional large specimen encountered is best considered as an extremely old individual. Size frequency studies may be of some use in differentiating between biocoenoses and thanatocoenoses. Nine genera or subgenera of Bellerophontacea are described, one of which is new. Forty-five species of Bellerophontacea are discriminated. Thirty-three of these are considered new, five are redescribed, and seven are discussed but not named. The Patellacea are less varied, with two genera and seven species being recognized. Three species are new, two are redescribed, and two are unnamed. Occurrence data are presented for all species.

VL  - 73

N2  - A recent dissection of the head of the whale shark, Rhineodon typus, showed the skull to be a highly specialized derivative of the more normal shark type. The more striking modifications are the great increase in size, the enlargement of the mouth and its terminal position, the widening of the neurocranium, the reduction of the teeth to minute denticles, and the development of the gill rakers into complex horny sieves. These are all habitus characters, correlated more or less directly with its diet of minute forms of pelagic life. In the fundamental or heritage characters, however, Rhineodon corresponds closely with Chlamydoselachus and other sharks. While the muscles of the neurocranium and visceral skeleton are typically selachian in their basic relationships and arrangement, they differ considerably in details of their form and attachments, as would be expected in such a highly specialized type. The pelvic fin and clasper are not unlike those of other sharks, the greatest differences being in the always variable terminal cartilages of the claspers.

T1  - Phylogenetic studies in the Papilioninae (Lepidoptera, Papilionidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 186
SP  - 1
N2  - Cladistic analyses of relationships among genera in the subfamily Papilioninae reveal that many taxonomic subgroups accepted by previous authors are not monophyletic. Four tribes are recognized: The Troidini and Papilionini are considered to be sister-groups; the genus Teinopalpus is given tribal status as the sister-group to the Troidini/Papilionini; the Graphiini is the sister-group of the other three tribes. An analysis of relationships among the five genera recognized in the Graphiini suggests that Eurytides and Protographium are sister-taxa, and that Iphiclides is the sister-group of a clade which includes Lamproptera and Graphium. Four subgenera within Graphium are recognized: Pazala, Pathysa, Arisbe, and Graphium. Meandrusa is placed in the Papilionini with Papilio, the latter being retained as a single genus. Two subtribes are recognized in the Troidini, the Battiti, containing only Battus, and the Troiditi, containing six genera. Parides consists of two Old World groups, subgenera Atrophaneura and Panosmia (formerly in the genus Atrophaneura), and Neotropical species (subgenus Parides). Subgenus Atrophaneura is equivalent to the nox group of previous authors; Panosmia is equivalent to the latreillei group. Parides is hypothesized to be the sister-genus of Troides, which contains all the 'birdwings.' The genera Ornithoptera, Ripponia, and Trogonoptera are synonymized with Troides. Pachliopta, comprised of Munroe's Pachliopta plus species (subgenus Losaria) formerly in Atrophaneura, is the sister-group of a clade which includes Cressida and Euryades. A single species, Pharmacophagus antenor--removed from Atrophaneura and given generic status--is the sister-group of all other Troiditi. Area cladograms for genera in the Graphiini and Troidini reveal few patterns, but suggest that some taxa are between 50 and 80 million years old. Available character information for the fossil genus Praepapilio is insufficient to determine its phylogenetic placement with respect to extant Papilionidae.

VL  - 186
SP  - 270
N2  - The present paper is the first attempt to describe all the Eupithecia of Chile, including the Juan Fernandez Islands. The few previously named species are redescribed in the same format as the new species, with descriptions and illustrations of the adults, male antennae, ventral plates, and male and female genitalia. Separate keys are provided for males and females; a number of the species are known only from one sex, so the keys are, of necessity, incomplete. The Eupithecia of Chile are divided into two sections. The first has males with the tergite of the eighth segment fully sclerotized, and the sternite (or ventral plate) with each lateral piece separate; the second has the male tergite reduced to a slender median strip and the ventral plate has a wide anterior basal portion with two attached, posteriorly extending arms. Section 2 is subdivided into four groups, based primarily on the nature of the female genitalia. These structures of the species of Section 1 have each bursa copulatrix elongate and membranous, with at least the posterior half having parallel striations. In Section 2, the females of Group A have the round or elliptical bursa copulatrix entirely membranous; of Group B, similar to the preceding but with symmetrical ornamentation, either in the form of areas or strips of minute spines or setae, or in elongate spines surrounding or partially encircling the areas of minute spines; of Group C, the bursa copulatrix has a sclerotized, usually longitudinally striate strip extending between the ductus bursae and the origin of the ductus seminalis; and, of Group D, the bursa is an elongate structure with numerous prominent stellate spines encircling the organ. A total of 43 species are recognized in this paper. Of these, three are endemic to the Juan Fernandez Islands, while the remaining 39 are endemic to the mainland of Chile. Of the latter, the following 29 are described as new: anticura, atacamaensis, aysenae, cabrasae, caburgua, canchasae, correana, curacautinae, encoensis, grappleri, horismoides, juncalensis, malchoensis, mallecoensis, maule, nahuelbuta, nublae, osornoensis, petrohue, picada, pucatrihue, recintoensis, seatacama, taracapa, tenoensis, trancasae, transexpiata, valdivia, vallenarensis, and yelchoensis. The following new subjective synonyms are proposed: Heteropithecia Vojnits (1985), Neopithecia Vojnits (1985), and Propithecia Vojnits (1985) are placed under Eupithecia Curtis (1825); akerbergsi Vojnits (1985) under spurcata Warren (1904); praelongata Warren (1900) and davisi Vojnits (1985) under sibylla Butler (1882); and kristenseni Vojnits (1985) under rosalia Butler (1882).

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 186
SP  - 105
N2  - Species of the large neotropical and Indopacific genus Zygothrica are reclassified from Burla's (1956) species-groups, as based on cladistic character analyses and a classification reflecting relative genealogical relationships. The genus is defined by a prominent and sharp facial carina, a medially cleft oral margin, and a sclerotized proboscis with an acute joint between the mentum and submentum. Zygothrica is divided into five sections, and each section is variously divided into hierarchical levels. Cladistic hypotheses are based on adult morphological traits and reproductive behavioral repertoires of seven of the species. Breeding records are reviewed and immatures of three species are described. Removed from Zygothrica and placed into the thoracis species-group of Drosophila (Hirtodrosophilia) are the following: D.(H.) clypitata, n. nov. (for Z. clypeata Burla, 1956), D.(H.) strigocula, n. comb., and D.(H.) pleurostrigata, n.comb. Species accounts are given for 62 (neotropical) members of clade 1, which is a portion of the largest Zygotrica group. Of these, 48 are new species described as the following: abbrevidispar, aliucapa, amplialdrichi, andea, antedispar, anota, bilinefilia, caputrichia, celsa, centralis, cryptica, dissimulata, femina, florinjecta, fuscalata, glossusta, joeyesco, karenae, latipanops, latipaps, manni, mediogaster, mediovitta, microeristes, neolinea, nigra, nigropleura, ora, oviserrata, pallida, panamensis, panopia, paravitta, perplexa, peruviana, pictura, posthona, prensiseta, radialis, simulans, somatia, sphaerocera, spinathigma, tambopata, trinidada, vitrea, zonata, and zygia. Provided for most of the 62 species are distribution maps and figures of various diagnostic morphological features, including wings and male and female terminalia. Synonymies are given for Zygothrica orbitalis (Sturt.) (which are Z. nitidifrons Duda, Z. ochracella Hendel, and Z. parilis Burla) and Z. bilineata (Williston) (synonym: Z. gemma Burla). Zygothrica poeyi of Burla is a misidentification for Z. laevifrons Duda. Hypotheses of supraspecific relationships within a large portion of clade 1 are discussed. Fourteen species have broad-headed ('hypercephalic') males, and the trait is hypothesized to have arisen six times among them.

T1  - Eocene nautiloids of British Somaliland.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 99
SP  - 317
N2  - Some 20 years ago, W.A. Macfadyen and J.A. Hunt collected well over a hundred Tertiary nautiloids from British Somaliland (which had previously yielded only two specimens), and these constitute the basis for this study. All but one of them came from the north central portion of the country. The great majority were secured from the section exposed along the Biyo Gora River at Daban, some 25 kilometers southeast of Berbera. At that place, nautiloids occur in two zones, one in the Lower and one in the Middle Eocene; they are so abundant in the latter that the containing strata have been termed the Nautilus beds. A few sporadic individuals were secured from strata of comparable age at several other localities. Almost all of the forms known from British Somaliland belong in two closely related genera, Cimomia and Deltoidonautilus, but we have in addition a single representative of Aturia (a new species) and a very incomplete specimen that we are referring with question to Eutrephoceras. One species of Cimomia and one of Deltoidonautilus had already been described and named from the country; we are establishing six more of the former genus and four of the latter, and in addition are including discussions (and in some cases illustrations) of fragmentary and/or poorly preserved representatives of both. Figure 1 elucidates the relative abundance and general distribution of all of these forms. The literature contains references to a good many sporadic occurrences of Tertiary nautiloids in various parts of Africa. However, none of the British Somaliland forms seems to belong in species known from elsewhere, and none of the assemblages is similar except in a general way. The closest are perhaps those known from Senegal and Sudan in French West Africa. The fauna of the upper Ranikot series of western India (Sind) is somewhat reminiscent of the only large one known from Somaliland, that of the Nautilus beds at Daban, but the relationship is rather distant. Furthermore, close counterparts of the African faunas under consideration are not known from any of the other continents.

N2  - The American diplurid genus Euagrus, distributed from Arizona south to Costa Rica, is revised for the first time. Euagrus is defined to include those euagrine diplurids with the following character states: no australotheline crescent; terminal cymbial spines; interlocking spinule patches on male femora I and II; a ventral, proximal, nonspatulate, tibia II mating apophysis with one or more large apical spines; two or three ventral mating keels on metatarsus II; no macrosetae brush on the prolateral surface of male tibia II; and two or more sclerotized stalks with unsclerotized bulbs on each (unsclerotized) spermathecal trunk. The relationships of Euagrus to other euagrine genera are discussed. A cladogram (based on outgroup comparison with the sister genus, Phyxioschema), a key, diagnoses, descriptions, tables of quantitative character values, illustrations, analyses of variation, natural history information, locality records, and distribution maps are provided for the 20 recognized species of Euagrus. Eight of these species are newly described: E. carlos, E. charcus, E. garnicus, E. gertschi, E. gus, E. leones, E. rothi, and E. zacus. Six specific names are newly synonymized: E. ravenus Gertsch and Mulaik, E. apacheus Gertsch and Mulaik, and E. ritaensis Chamberlin and Ivie with E. chisoseus Gertsch; E. empiricus Chamberlin and E. scepticus Chamberlin with E. josephus Chamberlin; and E. pragmaticus Chamberlin with E. rubrigularis Simon.

N2  - The western Nearctic species of the cosmopolitan genus Phytocoris Fallén are revised. Ecertobia Reuter and Pallacocoris Reuter are proposed as new junior synonyms of Phytocoris. One-hundred and ninety-nine species are recognized including four that also occur in the Palearctic region. The species are distributed among 20 newly proposed species-groups, primarily on the basis of head morphology, dorsal vestiture, and characteristics of the male genitalia. Seventy-eight new species are described and the following new synonymies are proposed (senior synonym first): acaciae Knight = minuendus Knight; calli Knight = laticeps Knight; deserticola Knight = lineatellus Knight; empirensis Knight = rinconae Knight; fraterculus Van Duzee = westwoodi Bliven; fuscipennis Knight = longirostris Knight; geniculatus Van Duzee = blackwelli Bliven; interspersus Uhler = viridescens Knight; juniperanus Knight = chiricahuae Knight, flaviatus Knight, santaritae Knight; ketinelbi Bliven = kahtahbi Bliven; knowltoni Knight = albertae Knight, elongatus Knight; laevis (Uhler) = rolfsi Knight; maritimus Van Duzee = sequoiae Bliven; neglectus Knight = yuroki Bliven; nigrifrons Van Duzee = abiesi Knight, tehamae Bliven; relativus Knight = albiscutellatus Knight; stellatus Van Duzee = arcatae Bliven, tinctus Knight; stitti Knight = albiceps Knight, merinoi Knight; strigosus Knight = flavellus Knight; sublineatus Knight = subcinctus Knight, tanneri Knight; tenuis Van Duzee = gracillatus Knight; ventralis Van Duzee = contrastus  Knight, ephedrae Knight, quadricinctus Knight; vinaceus Van Duzee = hyampom Bliven; yollabollae Bliven = albiclavus Knight, montanae Knight, taos Knight. Illustrations are provided for the male genitalia of all species, and scanning electron micrographs are presented for the head, pretarsus, and dorsal vestiture of representative species. Dorsal habitus illustrations are provided for representatives of nine species-groups. A detailed diagnosis and description are included for the genus and each of the 20 species-groups. A key to species groups is given, as well as keys to the species of each group. All species treatments include a diagnosis and summary information on biology, host plant associations, and distribution. Detailed descriptions and specific locality data are included only for the new species. Phytocoris species diversity and endemism are greatest in shrub and steppe, and desert communities of the southwestern United States. The majority of western Nearctic species are host-specific inhabitants of trees and shrubs, but a few ubiquitous species are known to breed on grasses and herbaceous plants. Many species occurring on woody plants appear to be inhabitants of bark. The nymphs and adults of most species are believed to be primarily predaceous. Nearctic and Palearctic species have been observed feeding on small, soft-bodied insects and mites, including several important pests of forests and orchards.

The genus Maurocoris Poppius is synonymized with Harpedona Distant and Prodromopsis Poppius is renewed as a synonym of Prodromus Distant. The following species are synonymized (senior synonym listed last): Mertila brevicornis Poppius = Mertila malayensis Distant; Prodromopsis basalis Poppius, Prodromopsis cuneatus (Distant), Prodromopsis scutellaris Poppius, Prodromus cochinensis Odhiambo = Prodromus clypeatus Distant; Prodromus pedunculatus Odhiambo = Prodromus oculatus (Poppius); Prodromus flavonotus Odhiambo = Prodromus thaliae China. The following new combinations are created: Maurocoris unicolor Poppius = Harpedona unicolor; Prodromus aethiopicus Poppius = Duducoris aethiopicus. Prodromus alboviridescens (Motschulsky) is assigned the status of nomen dubium. Harpedona fulvigenis (Poppius), Prodromus joveri Delattre, and Prodromus nimbus Delattre were not examined in conjunction with the present study. A dorsal habitus illustration is provided for each genus. Scanning electron micrographs of the metathoracic scent efferent system, pretarsus, and other structures are presented for most genera. Line drawings of the male genitalia and distribution maps are given for all species. A cladistic analysis of species is performed for each genus and keys for the identification of species are provided. A revised diagnosis and description of each genus are included, and descriptions or redescriptions given for all species.

T1  - Observations on intertidal organism associations of St. Catherines Island, Georgia. 1, General description and paleoecological implications.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 159
SP  - 89
N2  - Intertidal environments of St. Catherines Island, Georgia are diverse and include exposed sand beaches, sandy tidal flats, relict salt marsh deposits (mud and peat) on exposed beaches, and salt marsh complexes. Nine localities from the northern half of St. Catherines Island were selected for study because they displayed a wide variety of intertidal habitats and organism associations. No attempt was made to describe the entire spectrum of intertidal associations on St. Catherines Island. The bulk of study was made on the relict salt marsh deposits. Besides representing unique modern habitats for infaunal and epifaunal bivalve-dominated associations, the salt marsh deposits gave us valuable paleoecological insights. The organism groupings recognized in the present study are associations in the sense of Kauffman and Scott (1976), but communities in the usage of most workers. One relict mud occurrence contained an assemblage of six distinct associations. The fidelity of replication of these associations in the fossil record depends, in part, upon the steepness of the intertidal environmental stress gradients and the resultant spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity. The infaunal bivalves of the relict muds showed expected trends of size distribution with depth, the larger individuals occupying the greater depths. It is suggested that the lateral transportation of dislodged mud clasts has an analog in the geological past in the occurrence of 'exotic' fossiliferous pods and steinkerns. Association boundaries were sharp only where spatial heterogeneity was pronounced, such as within salt marsh complexes. The polychaete associations along sandy tidal flats were less clearly bounded and were often marginally intergradational. Many observations on the intertidal associations of St. Catherines Island were in disagreement with observations made on similar associations elsewhere. Contrary to the conclusions of Woodin (1976), dense infaunal bivalve populations (Petricola pholadiformis) did coexist with dense epifaunal bivalve populations (Brachidontes recurvus). Also, repeated observations of dense tube-building polychaete populations failed to show epifaunal bivalves as predominant co-occurring forms. Polychaete associations along a narrow tidal flat displayed onshore-offshore distributional trends that may have paleoecological utility in the resolution of transgression-regression sequences. Tidal creek populations of Ilynassa obsoleta have a narrower aperture relative to total height than similar populations from more open sand flats. It is suggested that this is correlated with the greater duration of intertidal exposure in the tidal creek habitat. Study of another intertidal snail, Littorina irrorata, demonstrated considerable lateral as well as vertical motility in that species.

N2  - The genus Rhinacloa Reuter is revised. Thirty-seven species are included, 17 of which are described as new. Campylomma cardini Barber and Bruner, Europiella mella Van Duzee, Psallus incaicus Carvalho and Gomes, Psallus insularis Carvalho, Psallus longirostris Carvalho, Psallus usingeri Carvalho and Sthenarus basalis Reuter are transferred to Rhinacloa. The following new synonymies are created: Rhinacloa antennalis (Reuter) = Rhinacloa melanotelus Reuter; Rhinacloa clavicornis (Reuter) = Rhinacloa subpallicornis Knight and Rhinacloa lepagei Carvalho; Rhinacloa forticornis Reuter = Psallus minutulus Reuter and Rhinacloa incerta Reuter; Rhinacloa basalis (Reuter), new combination = Rhinacloa pallida Reuter, Rhinacloa pusillus (Knight), and Rhinacloa castanea Carvalho; Rhinacloa pallidipes Maldonaldo = Lepidopsallus riodocensis Carvalho and Rhinacloa punctipes Maldonaldo. Demarata mirifica Distant is treated as a species incertae sedis. Rhinacloa araguaiana Carvalho is transferred to Paramixia Reuter (Pilophorini). Lygus ordinatus Distant is placed in Ellenia Reuter (Phylini). Illustrations are presented for the antennae and male genitalic structures of most known Rhinacloa species; scanning electron micrographs are presented for the pretarsus and scale-like setae of many species. A key to separate the included species is included. A phylogenetic analysis of the species is presented, using Campylomma verbasci Meyer-Dür, Microphylidea prosopidis Knight, and Nigrimiris pallipes Carvalho and Schaffner for outgroup comparison. Distributional maps are provided for all species, indicating a range for Rhinacloa from the southwestern United States, the Caribbean including the Florida Keys, (with three widely distributed species occurring in Florida), the Galapagos Islands, and south to northern Argentina and central Chile. Rhinacloa forticornis is introduced into Hawaii.

N2  - The monogeneric tribe Orsolobini Cooke is removed from the Dysderidae, elevated to familial status, and redefined to include those dysderoids with a raised tarsal organ. As relimited, the family contains 170 species from Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, the Auckland and Campbell islands, Chile, Argentina, and the Falkland Islands. Six genera are transferred from the Oonopidae to the Orsolobidae: Tasmanoonops Hickman, Cornifalx Hickman, Ascuta Forster, Duripelta Forster, Pounamuella (nomen novum for Pounamua Forster, preoccupied), and Subantarctia Forster. Eighteen new genera are described: Falklandia (type species Orsolobus rumbolli Schiapelli and Gerschman from the Falkland Islands), Mallecolobus (type species M. malacus, new species, from Chile; also including three other new species from Chile), Chileolobus (type species C. eden, new species, from Chile), Osornolobus (type species O. canan, new species, from Chile; also including 16 new species from Chile), Hickmanolobus (type species Oonopinus mollipes Hickman from Tasmania, transferred from the Oonopidae), Australobus (type species A. torbay, new species, from Western Australia), Waipoua (type species W. toronui, new species, from New Zealand; also including Pounamua totara Forster from New Zealand, P. gressitti Forster from Campbell Island, and five other new species from New Zealand), Wiltonia (type species W. graminicola, new species, from New Zealand; also including eight other new species from New Zealand), Tautukua (type species T. isolata, new species, from New Zealand), Bealeyia (type species B. unicolor, new species, from New Zealand), Dugdalea (type species D. oculata, new species, from New Zealand), Anopsolobus (type species A. subterraneus, new species, from New Zealand), Turretia (type species T. dugdalei, new species, from New Zealand), Orongia (type species O. medialis, new species, from New Zealand; also including two other new species from New Zealand), Paralobus (type species Ascuta salmoni Forster from New Zealand), Tangata (type species T. nigra, new species, from New Zealand; also including Ascuta stewartensis Forster, A. rakiura Forster, A. orepukiensis Forster, A. alpina Forster, A. plena Forster, and 11 other new species from New Zealand), Maoriata (type species Ascuta magna Forster from New Zealand; also including two new species from New Zealand), and Waiporia (type species W. wiltoni, new species, from New Zealand; also including Ascuta extensa Forster, A. modica Forster, A. algida Forster, A. mensa Forster, Pounamua hornabrooki Forster, and six other new species from New Zealand). Sixty-two other new species are described in previously established genera: seven Orsolobus from Chile and Argentina, 25 Tasmanoonops from Australia and Tasmania, and 10 Ascuta, 13 Duripelta, 3 Pounamuella, and 4 Subantarctia from New Zealand. Ascuta pallida Forster is transferred to Duripelta. The females of Tangata rakiura (Forster), T. plena (Forster), Waiporia modica (Forster), and Pounamuella ramsayi (Forster) and the male of P. australis (Forster) are described for the first time. The characters of the four dysderoid families are reviewed.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 97
SP  - 435
N2  - This paper is a review of the larks breeding in Iran, Afghanistan, and India. In the case of Alauda, a formal review of all the forms east of the Caucasus is presented. Ten genera, treated in the following order, occur in Asia: Mirafra, Eremopterix, Ammomanes, Alaemon, Calandrella, Melanocorypha, Eremophila, Galerida, Alauda, and Lullula. The generic characters, which are briefly discussed, show much convergence. Twenty-three species breed in Iran, Afghanistan, and India. A key to the species and a table of distribution are given. Habitat preferences are mentioned. Some species have strict ecological requirements, and in these the limiting factor appears to be aridity. In others where the habitat seems more varied it is suggested that habitat preferences vary or may vary geographically. The correlation between the coloration of the plumage and the soil (cryptic coloration) is discussed. A large series of 73 samples from southern Europe, Mediterranean islands, Africa, and India shows that the correlation is strongest in Africa. A comparison of the desert species (Ammomanes deserti) and the semi-desert species (Galerida cristata), common to both Africa and the Iranian region, shows that in Africa these species have many more races and show abrupt variations in coloration. In the Iranian region the variation is conspicuously slight, although the physical factors of the environment are substantially the same and the background as variable as in Africa. It is postulated that the Iranian forms may wander more in search of suitable conditions and that general inconspicuousness in shade rather than close adaptation in hue is the determining factor in the protection against predation. The experiments of Dice are cited. The species characters are discussed. Differences in the wing formula and in the pattern of the plumage appear to be excellent species characters. A number of closely related forms that have been treated as conspecific are shown conclusively to be separate species. In every instance where these species are separated by a difference in the wing formula or shape of the wing they are found also to overlap and breed in the same regions, or, in one instance where there is no overlap, they are separated by abrupt differences in both the wing formula and the pattern of the plumage. In some cases all three factors are present. The forms hitherto treated as conspecific but thus separated are: Ammomanes phoenicurus and A. cincturus, Calandrella cinerea and C. acutirostris, probably C. rufescens and C. leucophaea, Melanocorypha bimaculata and M. calandra, and Alauda arvensis and A. gulgula. Molt and plumages are discussed. Larks show several types of molt. In most species there is only one molt a year, a complete postnuptial and a complete postjuvenal molt, and first winter birds are indistinguishable from adults. But in other species the postjuvenal molt is partial and is limited to that of the body feathers. In other species there is a double annual molt, a complete postnuptial and postjuvenal molt and a partial prenuptial molt, very full or limited to the feathers of the head. In still other species the first winter plumage differs from that of the adult.

N2  - One. A fundamental similarity existing among the complex reproductive systems of the Nudibranchiata is pointed out and a classification is presented based on the extent of primary and secondary bifurcation of the hermaphrodite duct. Four types of system are indicated, any one of which might conceivably be the phylogenetic derivative of any other. 2. The histology and anatomy of the reproductive system in Embletonia fuscata, a typical aeolid, are given, and the functional implications of the existing anatomical relationships discussed. 3. Some phases of the natural history of reproduction in the Nudibranchiata are discussed indicating that the mass migrations supposed to precede and follow spawning probably do not occur.

VL  - 183
SP  - 115
N2  - The world genera of Lymexylidae (Coleoptera: Cucujiformia: Lymexyloidea) are revised, including descriptions of two new genera. All described species are given generic assignments. Seven genera are recognized and assigned to three subfamilies: Hylecoetinae Boving and Craighead, 1931, including Hylecoetus Latreille; Lymexylinae Boving and Craighead, 1931 (sensu novo), including Lymexylon Fabricius and Atractocerus Palisot de Beauvois (including Raractocetus Kurosawa, new synonym, Hymaloxylon Kurosawa, new synonym, Arractocetus Kurosawa, new synonym, and Fusicornis Philippi); and Melittomminae, new subfamily, including Australymexylon, new genus, Melittomma Murray, Melittommopsis Lane, and Protomelittomma, new genus. Neohylecoetus Kurosawa is synonymized with Melittomma Murray, and Hylecoetopsis Lane is excluded from the Lymexylidae (and presumed to belong to the Cleridae). Species of the endemic Australian genus Australymexylon are revised and include A. australe (Erichson) (transferred from Lymexylon) and A. fuscipennis (Lea) (Hylecoetus). Hylecoetus linearis Lea and Lymexylon adelaidae Blackburn are synonymized with Australymexylon australe. Species level taxonomic changes include the following: Hylecoetus cossis Lewis, H. matsushitai Kono, and H. cribricolle (Fairmaire) are all synonymized with H. dermestoides (L.); Melittomma javanus (Kurosawa) (Neohylecoetus), M. pervagum (Olliff) (Hylecoetus), M. philippensis (Kurosawa) (Neohylecoetus), and M. vigilans (Lea) (Hylecoetus) are new combinations (but see Kurosawa, 1985); Melittommopsis validum (Schenkling) (Melittomma), M. ruficolle (Pic) (Melittomma), and M. abdominale (Pic) (Melittomma) are new combinations; and Protomelittomma insulare (Fairmaire) (Melittomma) is a new combination. For each genus, the following are given: a habitus drawing; illustrations of important characters; diagnosis; description of a representative species; list of species included; summaries of cladistic relations, geographic distributions, fungus hosts, arboreal hosts and bionomics; and a discussion. The cladistic relations among the genera are discussed, and my hypothesis is summarized as follows: (Hylecoetus + ((Lymexylon + Atractocerus) + (Australymexylon + (Protomelittomma + (Melittomma + Melittommopsis))))). The geographic history of the family is discussed. A key to and diagnoses of world subfamilies and genera are given, as well as discussions about the constitution of Lymexyloidea, natural history and economic importance of Lymexylidae, a detailed account of the morphology of Hylecoetus dermestoides, and a reclassification of supraspecific taxa.

N2  - The 'hypochiloids,' the most primitive known araneomorph spiders, are reclassified on the basis of a cladistic analysis of the results of a comparative morphological survey.  Platnick's previous hypothesis--that the family Hypochilidae, containing two genera (Hypochilus, from the United States, and Ectatosticta, from China), represents the sister group of all other araneomorphs--is corroborated, and four new species of Hypochilus (H. pococki, H. coylei, H. sheari, and H. kastoni) are described. However, Platnick's and all other previous arrangements of the remaining 'hypochiloid' genera are rejected in favor of a hypothesis that these austral taxa form a monophyletic group, the superfamily Austrochiloidea, containing two families, the Austrochilidae and Gradungulidae. The family Hickmaniidae Lehtinen, containing only the Tasmanian species Hickmania troglodytes (Higgins and Petterd), is relegated to subfamilial status within the Austrochilidae. In its sister group, the Austrochilinae, Lehtinen's synonymy of Austrochilus manni Gertsch and Zapfe with Thaida peculiaris Karsch is rejected on both the specific and generic levels; four new species of Austrochilus (A. melon, A. schlingeri, A. franckei, and A. newtoni) and one new species of Thaida (T. chepu) are described from Chile and adjacent Argentina. Five new genera of Gradungulidae are described: Spelunga, containing S. cavernicola, new species, from New Zealand; Tarlina, containing five new species (T. noorundi, type species, T. milledgei, T. smithersi, T. daviesae, and T. simipes) and T. woodwardi (Forster), transferred from Gradungula, all from eastern Australia; Kaiya, containing three new species (K. terama, type species, K. bemboka, and K. parnabyi) and K. brindabella (Moran), transferred from Gradungula, all from eastern Australia; Pianoa, containing P. isolata, new species, from New Zealand; and Macrogradungula, containing M. moonya, new species, from Queensland, Australia.

T1  - Ontogeny of Upper Cretaceous (Turonian-Santonian) scaphitid ammonites from the Western Interior of North America : systematics, developmental patterns, and life history.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 185
SP  - 118
N2  - Scaphites are a group of late Cretaceous heteromorphic ammonites in which the final body chamber partially uncoils, thereby marking the attainment of the adult stage. This distinctive change in shape permits unequivocal separation of variation due to developmental stage from phenotypic variation among adults. In the Western Interior of North America, scaphites are represented by a wide diversity of endemic species. Many of these species are abundant and well preserved and, therefore, are especially suitable for a detailed investigation of ontogenetic development. I studied the ontogeny of several species of Turonian-Santonian scaphites in the genera Scaphites, Clioscaphites and Pteroscaphites, utilizing both whole fossils and polished sections. The study of their ontogeny bears on the questions of scaphite systematics and morphological development, and ammonite life history in general. The initial whorls of scaphites, as in other ammonites, consist of a bulbous protoconch and part of a planispiral whorl (referred to as the ammonitella). The ammonitella displays a uniform tuberculate micro-ornamentation extending 0.75 whorls to a depression (primary constriction) after which growth lines appear. The shell wall is prismatic in microstructure and nacre first appears at the constriction where it forms an internal pad (primary varix). These morphological observations support a scheme of direct development in which the constriction marks the aperture of the embryonic shell. Preserved ammonitellas of Scaphites ferronensis and Baculites cf. B. asper, B. codyensis suggest that hatching may have occurred after the development of the Proseptum. In scaphites, the proseptum displays a unique necklike attachment that appears as a superimposed saddle on the prosuture. The caecum and its prosiphonal attachment are similar among all the species studied. The diameter of the embryonic shell averages 700 [micrometers] and ranges from approximately 600 to 800 [micrometers]. The ammonitella angle averages 270, which is similar to the angular length of the juvenile body chamber. Unlike modern Nautilus, the embryonic shell is comparable in size to the young of many Recent dibranchiate cephalopods and may have followed a planktonic mode of life immediately after hatching. The juvenile shell conforms to a logarithmic spiral but exhibits a conspicuous change in morphology at approximately 3-4 mm diameter corresponding to two whorls from the primary constriction. The change involves modifications in the growth patterns of the umbilical diameter and spiral radius and coincides with the first appearance of macro-ornamentation. It also corresponds to a minimum in septal spacing and the attainment of a stable, ventral position of the siphuncle. These changes may indicate a transition from a passive planktonic to a more active mode of life. Similar morphometric changes occur in many other ammonites at this approximate size and whorl number and may represent a common developmental pattern. In micromorph scaphites of the genus Pteroscaphites, this whorl size coincides with the initiation of an accelerated maturity. As in modern Nautilus, the period of septal secretion in scaphites and other ammonites was probably dependent on the rate of apertural growth and buoyancy requirements rather than external astronomical rhythms. The period may also have displayed an increase over ontogeny, although the absolute rate of growth is unknown. Maturity is expressed by the development of an uncoiled body chamber, although the degree of uncoiling varies widely among species. Interspecific comparisons are therefore facilitated by examination of the more similarly shaped phragmocones. Within species, histograms of adult phragmocone diameter form unimodal distributions although a well-marked sexual dimorphism appears in many species. The ratio of maximum to minimum phragmocone diameter ranges from 1.7 in S. preventricosus to 4.6 in S. carlilensis. The diameter of the adult phragmocone and the number of postembryonic whorls exhibit a positive correlation within and among species. The adult size and the extent to which the mature body chamber uncoils also covary within and among species. Evolutionary changes in size, with concomitant changes in the timing of sexual maturation, may thus explain interspecific variation in the degree of mature uncoiling.

T1  - The phylogenetic relationships of soft-shelled turtles (family Trionychidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 186
SP  - 1
N2  - Phylogenetic analysis of 113 characters of the osteology of the 22 living species of trionychid turtles and representatives of all other living turtle families, provides abundant evidence on the relationships of soft-shelled turtles to other turtles and on the interrelationships within the family. These data suggest that the family Trionychidae shares a unique common ancestor with the Dermatemydidae, Kinosternidae, and Carettochelyidae, and that the Kinosternidae share a unique common ancestor with the Trionychidae and Carettochelyidae. Furthermore, it appears that the staurotypine kinosternids are most closely related to the Trionychidae and Carettochelyidae. Carettochelyids and trionychids share numerous unique features and clearly constitute a monophyletic group. Within the Trionychidae, the subfamilies Cyclanorbinae and Trionychinae are recognized as monophyletic clades. Recognition of three cyclanorbine genera, Cycloderma, Cyclanorbis, and Lissemys, is warranted. Within the Trionychinae, four distinct clades are recognized. The Trionyx cartilagineus group includes Chitra indica and Pelochelys bibroni, on the basis of the unique location of the foramen posterior canalis carotici interni, and features of the trigeminal region. The North American group includes T. triunguis, T. euphraticus, T. swinhoei, T. ferox, T. spiniferus, and T. muticus, and can be recognized by the presence of eight or fewer neurals (first and second are fused), deeply emarginate prefrontals, and a large contribution by the parietal to the processus trochlearis oticum. The Indian group includes four species: T. gangeticus, T. hurum, T. leithii, and T. nigricans; all exhibit a free first neural, five plastral callosities, and intermediately extended epiplastra. Lastly, the T. steindachneri group, which includes T. steindachneri, T. sinensis, and T. subplanus, is diagnosed by a descending spine of the opisthotic that divides the fenestra postotica in most specimens. Two equally parsimonious arrangements of the Trionychinae differ in the placement of the North American clade. In one, this clade is the sister group of the T. cartilagineus clade; in the other, it is the sister group of the T. steindachneri clade. In both, the Indian group is paraphyletic and gives rise to the T. steindachneri clade. A revised classification of the family Trionychidae is provided. The use of 2 subfamilies, 6 tribes, and 14 genera is recommended. This expanded taxonomy will more completely reflect the hierarchical relationships that reflect recency of common ancestry as determined by the cladistic analyses.

N2  - Meiolania platyceps is the best known of the extinct horned turtles of the Southern Hemisphere. Five skulls and hundreds of cranial elements have been collected from Pleistocene rocks on Lord Howe Island, New South Wales, over the past 100 years. The skull of Meiolania platyceps has the following features of the family Meiolaniidae: (1) Squamosal and supraoccipital produced into large posteriorly and posterolaterally directed processes that extend clear of the skull roof; (2) Medial plate of pterygoid separated ventrally from basisphenoid to form intrapterygoid slit. Meiolania platyceps can be identified as Crytodira on the possession of: (1) A processus trochlearis oticum on the anterior edge of the otic chamber; (2) A pterygoid that extends posteriorly between quadrate and braincase; (3) A descending process of the prefrontal that meets the vomer ventromedially. Within the Crytodira, Meiolania platyceps can be identified as Eucryptodira based on the posterior position of the foramen posterius canalis carotici interni.

One juvenile specimen cannot be assigned to species and differs from all known juveniles. It may represent a new species, but adults must be acquired before this can be conclusively shown. Chiloscyllium includes seven species: C. burmensis, new species, C. confusum, new species, C. hasselti, C. griseum, C. indicum, C. punctatum, and C. plagiosum. Skeletal anatomy and dermal denticles are studied and described for all species. A scheme of interrelationships within the family is proposed. The family Hemiscyllidae and the included genera of Hemiscyllium and Chiloscyllium are shown to be monophyletic.

T1  - Frogs of the fitzingeri group of Eleutherodactylus in eastern Panama and Chocoan South America (Leptodactylidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 175
SP  - 484
N2  - Based on field data and on examination of more than 3000 preserved specimens, species limits and distributions are defined for the frogs currently assigned to the fitzingeri group of Eleutherodactylus in the Chocoan lowlands (mainly below 1000 m. elev. in eastern Panama, western Colombia, and western Ecuador). Several of the species are abundant, ecologically important animals that have been repeatedly confused in the literature. Nine species are treated in detail and described and illustrated from living as well as preserved material, with natural history notes added where possible. Eleutherodactylus achatinus (Boulenger) occurs from Panama south to southwestern Ecuador; the names E. brederi Dunn and Hylodes pagmae are assigned to its synonymy (although brederi might yet prove to be a valid sibling species with a different call). Eleutherodactylus caprifer Lynch is known from west-central Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. These two species lack appreciable toe webbing. The following four species have moderate toe webbing: Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri (O. Schmidt) occurs from Nicaragua to west-central Colombia, being here treated primarily in the southern part of its range, where it has been confused with Eleutherodactylus raniformis (Boulenger)--a larger frog that occurs from eastern Panama south to west-central Colombia. Eleutherodactylus longirostris (Boulenger) occurs from the Darién highlands of extreme eastern Panama throughout western Colombia to southern Ecuador. All previous reports of longirostris in lower Central America seem to have been based on specimens either of fitzingeri or especially of Eleutherodactylus crassidigitus Taylor, whose range is extended out of Costa Rica and throughout the Isthmus of Panama to the Colombian border. However, the variation of crassidigitus remains inadequately studied and the redefined species might be a composite. E. crassidigitus differs from longirostris in color pattern, smaller size, and in a greater extent of toe webbing, although all specimens do not show these differences to the same degree. A closer relative (sister species) of longirostris may be the Central American E. talamancae Dunn. The remaining three species are streamside frogs having extensive toe webbing: Eleutherodactylus anomalus (Boulenger) is common in western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. Eleutherodactylus anatipes, new species, is known only from northwestern Ecuador, and Eleutherodactylus zygodactylus, new species, is described from west-central Colombia. The fitzingeri group of Eleutherodactylus is especially diverse in the Chocoan lowlands. At most localities in South America, only two or three species are ever sympatric, but west of the Andes as many as seven species of the group co-occur in geographic sympatry, with species density being greatest in the region of the Río San Juan drainage of Colombia. Natural history data are fragmentary. The vocalizations and/or calling behavior of several species have characteristics that may reduce the frogs' vulnerability to sound-responsive predators.

T1  - The spider genus Loxosceles in North America, Central America, and the West Indies (Araneae, Loxoscelidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 175
SP  - 264
N2  - The present paper deals with the brown spiders the genus Loxosceles (family Loxoscelidae) as they occur over temperate and tropical North America. These haplogynes spin irregular webs, serving as retreats and snares, under ground objects of many kinds, and in houses and buildings in the human litter around them. Since all species of Loxosceles are presumed to be venomous and at least five from our area have some kind of medical record a brief review of their status in the Nearctic Region is presented. The terms Haplogynae and Entelegynae are defined and discussed in reference to their copulatory patterns. In a section on various systematic problems in Loxosceles the status of numerous specific taxa is analyzed with the conclusion that they adequately fulfill all the requirements of valid species. The systematic account of the genus Loxosceles as it occurs in continental and insular North America supplants an earlier work (Gertsch, 1958) in which the then known 18 species were described and illustrated. The presently known 54 species from this wide area are characterized as follows: two species (rufipes and panama) are related to the laeta group of South America and are endemics in Central America; two species that can be called 'cosmopolitan' have been brought into North America by trade vehicles: laeta is now established in Central America and southern California, and rufescens is now widely distributed as a house spider over much of the United States; and the remaining 50 species of the reclusa group forming the endemic fauna over much of the United States, Mexico, and adjacent countries of Central America, and on the islands of the West Indies. Descriptions, illustrations, distribution maps, and keys to the taxa are offered under various geographical subdivisions. The Loxosceles of the United States now number 11 species of which seven are described as new; six of these have limited ranges southward into Mexico. The Loxosceles of Mexico and adjacent Central America now number 38 species of which 20 are described as new: nine mostly from the southern part of Baja California, four from the Sonoran enclave, and seven from the rest of Mexico and adjacent Central America; the species bolivari Gertsch, based on the mate holotype from Cueva García in Nuevo León, is a synonym of devia Gertsch and Mulaik; only one of the Mexican species, yucatana Chamberlin and Ivie, ranges into Central America to increase its endemics of the reclusa group to three species. The Loxosceles of the West Indies now number six species of which four are described as new; two species from Jamaica show moderate cave adaptation. The name unicolor Keyserling with spurious type locality, widely and improperly used by many authors for species from both North and South America, is abandoned as dubious. The southwestern species earlier given that name was renamed deserta by Gertsch.

N2  - The Phylinae (Hemiptera, Miridae) of the Indo-Pacific are revised, including all taxa known to occur in an area ranging from the Marquesas Islands west to India, north to the Hawaiian Islands and Japan (excluding temperate Asia) and south to New Zealand (excluding Australia and the sub-Antarctic islands). Forty-six genera and 272 species are treated in detail. One new tribe, Auricillocorini, is recognized. One new genus, Biliranoides, is described in the Pilophorini. Four new genera, Auricillocoris, Cleotomiris, Cleotomiroides, and Wygomiris, are placed in the Auricillocorini; Zaratus Distant is tentatively placed in the Auricillocorini. One new genus, Podullahas, is described in the Hallodapini; Clapmarius Distant is transferred from the Mirinae to the Hallodapini. Ten new genera, Abuyogocoris, Arafuramiris, Biromiris, Ctypomiris, Papuamimus, Solomonomimus, Gulacapsus, Pseudohallodapocoris, Pseudoleucophoroptera, and Trichocephalocapsus, are placed in the Leucophoropterini; Lasiolabops Poppius and Sejanus Distant are placed in the Leucophoropterini. Five new genera, Decomioides, Gressittocapsus, Malaysiamiris, Malaysiamiroides, and Rubrocuneocoris, are placed in the Phylini. The following genera are synonymized; Cephalocapsidea Poppius = Paramixia Reuter; Trichofulvius Poppius = Hallodapus Fieber; Torma China = Decomia Poppius; and Sampsigeranus Distant = Opuna Kirkaldy. The following species are synonymized: Orthotylellus samoanus Knight, Orthotylellus rufescens Usinger, and Orthotylellus pallescens Usinger = Paramixia rufescens (Poppius); Cephalocapsidea obscurata Poppius, Orthotylellus samoanus var. nigrellus Knight, and Orthotylellus brunescens = Paramixia singalensis (Poppius); Pilophorus pulullus Poppius = Pilophorus typicus Distant; Marshalliella orientalis Poppius = Ellenia obscuricornis (Poppius); Psallus sharpianus var. pelidnopterus Kirkaldy, Opuna hawaiiensis Kirkaldy, Psallus swezeyi Kirkaldy, Tichorhinus kirkaldyi Perkins, and Psallus sharpianus luteus Zimmerman = Opuna sharpianus (Kirkaldy); and, Ragmus morosus Ballard = Campylomma livida Reuter. The following new combinations are created: Atractotomus coxalis Reuter = Druthmarus coxalis; Cephalocapsidea rufescens Poppius = Paramixia rufescens; Psallus singalensis Distant = Paramixia singalensis; Lutheriella oecophylloides Poppius = Acrorrhinium oecophylloides; Trichofulvius fasciatus Poppius = Hallodapus fasciatus; Trichofulvius zonatus Poppius = Hallodapus zonatus; Atractotomus collinus Van Duzee = Campylomma collina; Torma colae China = Decomia colae; Torma samoanus Knight = Decomia samoanus; Campylomma innotata Carvalho = Decomioides innotata; Campylomma annulatus Knight = Opuna annulatus; Sampsigeranus pilosulus Distant = Opuna pilosulus; Psallus sharpianus Kirkaldy = Opuna sharpianus. Photographic dorsal view illustrations, male genitalic line drawings, and distributional maps are presented for most species. Scanning electron micrographs of the pretarsus, metathoracic scent- gland evaporatory area, and other structures are presented for most genera. Stridulatory structures are reported for additional species of Hallodapus Fieber and are also noted to occur in a similar form in species of Ctypomiris, new genus. A glandular opening and small evaporatory area are reported to occur on the posterior margin of the mesepimeron dorsad of the metathoracic scent-gland evaporatory area; this structure is apparently widely distributed in Heteroptera, although not previously reported in the literature. A key to the genera and keys to some groups of species are presented. A discussion to phylogenetic relationships and arguments for higher category placement are presented.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 178
SP  - 1
N2  - A comparative morphological survey of the archaeid spiders and their relatives is presented; cladistic analysis of the results supports the following taxonomic changes. The family Archaeidae Koch and Berendt is relimited to include only four genera: Archaea Koch and Berendt (containing six Baltic amber species and six Recent species from Madagascar), and the new genera Austrarchaea (type species Archaea nodosa Forster from Queensland; also including Archaea hickmani Butler from Victoria and a new species from Queensland), Afrarchaea (type species Archaea godfreyi Hewitt from South Africa and Madagascar), and Eoarchaea (type species Archaea hyperoptica Menge from Baltic amber). Other taxa previously placed in the Archaeidae are assigned to the family Mecysmaucheniidae Simon and the new families Pararchaeidae (for Pararchaea Forster, including seven species from New Zealand, Australia, and Tasmania) and Holarchacidae (for Holarchaea Forster, including H. novaeseelandiae Forster from New Zealand and Zearchaea globosa Hickman from Tasmania). The Mecysmaucheniidae is divided into two subfamilies. The Mecysmaucheniinae contains Mecysmauchenius Simon (type species M. segmentatus Simon from southern Chile, adjacent Argentina, and the Falkland Islands; also including M. gertschi Zapfe from central Chile and 14 new species from Chile and the Juan Fernandez Islands) and the new genera Mecysmauchenioides (type species Mecysmauchenius nordenskjoldi Tullgren from Chile), Semysmauchenius (type species S. antillanca, new species, from Chile), Mesarchaea (type species M. bellavista, new species, from Chile), and Aotearoa (type species Zearchaea magna Forster from New Zealand). The new subfamily Zearchaeinae contains Zearchaea Wilton (type species Z. clypeata Wilton from New Zealand; also including Z. fiordensis Forster from New Zealand) and the new genus Chilarchaea (type species C. quellon, new species, from Chile). Recent hypotheses by Lehtinen and Levi assigning these taxa to two different superfamilies are rejected. The four families are judged instead to constitute a monophyletic group with its closest relatives among the superfamily Palpimanoidea, which is expanded to include them as well as (in suggested sister-group sequence) the Textricellidae and Micropholcommatidae, the traditional palpimanoids (Huttoniidae, Stenochilidae, and Palpimanidae), and the Mimetidae.

T1  - Systematics and phylogeny of Hipparion, Neohipparion, Nannippus, and Cormohipparion (Mammalia, Equidae) from the Miocene and Pliocene of the New World.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 179
SP  - 1
N2  - Hipparions are a polyphyletic assemblage of three-toed horses that lived during the Miocene and Pliocene in the Old and New worlds. Four hipparion genera are recognized from Central and North America, they are: Hipparion sensu stricto, Neohipparion, Nannippus, and Cormohipparion. Of the 41 previously named species of New World hipparions, 15 are referred to the existing genera and the remaining 26 species names are considered to be either junior synonyms, incertae sedis, nomina nuda, or nomina dubia. One new species, Hipparion shirleyi, is described from the late Barstovian of the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain. This paper presents the systematics of New World hipparions in a scheme that principally includes an integration of quantitative and qualitative dental and cranial characters such as the configuration of the dorsal preorbital fossa. Statistical analyses of crania and dentitions provide determinations of the amount of character variation for North American hipparions. The hipparion from Mt. Léberon in southern France, Hipparion prostylum de Christol, 1832, is the genotypic species of Hipparion sensu stricto. In the New World, Hipparion sensu stricto is represented by three species; H. shirleyi, new species, H. tehonense (Merriam), 1916a, and H. forcei Richey, 1948, collectively known from the late Barstovian to the early Hemphillian of North America. Six species comprise the genus Neohipparion: N. coloradense (Osborn), 1918, N. affine (Leidy), 1869, N. trampasense (Edwards), 1982, N. leptode Merriam, 1915a, N. eurystyle (Cope), 1893, and N. gidleyi Merriam, 1915a, collectively known from the Clarendonian through late Hemphillian of Central and North America. Four species comprise the genus Nannippus: N. minor (Sellards), 1916, N. ingenuus (Leidy), 1885, N. beckensis Dalquest and Donovan, 1973, and N. peninsulatus (Cope), 1885, collectively known from the Clarendonian through late Blancan of Central and North America. In the New World, the genus Cormohipparion consists of three species, C. goorisi MacFadden and Skinner, 1981, C. sphenodus (Cope), 1889, and C. occidentale (Leidy), 1856, collectively known from the early Barstovian through early Hemphillian of North America. Hipparions are closely related to, or arose from, at least two separate taxa within the merychippine horse complex. The earliest North American hipparion, C. goorisi, is known from the 15-million-year old early Barstovian Gulf Coastal Plain of Texas. The peak of hipparion diversity in North America occurred about 12 to 8 1/2 million years ago during the height of the Clarendonian chronofauna. Hipparion diversity dropped during the Hemphillian. Only the genus Nannippus is known from the Blancan. Some previous workers state that all Old World hipparions were monophyletically descended from the oldest Old World species H. primigenium. However, based on similar hipparion facial morphotypes represented in both the Old and New worlds, it is possible that there were at least two hipparion dispersal events across Beringia, resulting in a polyphyletic assemblage in the Old World.

N2  - One. Embryonic development of the viviparous poeciliid fish Platypoecilus maculatus may be conveniently divided into 26 stages for descriptive purposes. 2. The embryonic growth rate for P. maculatus is determined by comparison of morphological age (in terms of embryonic stage) with theoretical age (days after the birth of a previous brood). This comparison is based on a series of embryonic broods obtained by laparotomy at various times during the twenty-eight- to thirty-day reproductive cycle of this species. 3. A study of growth and organogenesis in P. maculatus reveals the following features: A. The concomitant regression of the extra-embryonic membranes and the yolk mass is accompanied by a drop in the slope of the growth curve. B. The initial formation of the extra-embryonic membranes takes place in a manner similar to that in the 'amniotes.' C. Cleavage, gastrulation, and neurulation follow a course basically similar to that of other teleosts. D. Blastopore closure occurs after tail bud formation. E. The notochord forms directly from endoderm by delamination. F. Pigment formation is evident first in the retina and subsequently in the choroid and meningeal coats. G. Kupffer's vesicle (post-anal gut) contributes to the development of the urinary bladder. H. The formation of the ventral aorta and aortic arches is described with regard to the reversal of blood flow in the ventral aorta and the change of position of the sinus venosus during yolk regression. 4. Comparisons with other species of Platypoecilus (P. variatus, couchianus, and xiphidium) reveal no significant differences in embryonic development. 5. Platypoecilus maculatus development, compared to that of Xiphophorus hellerii and Platypoecilus-Xiphophorus hybrids, shows the following differences: A. Initial pigment differentiation in Xiphophorus occurs one stage later than in Platypoecilus. The hybrids form pigment at the same stage as Platypoecilus or earlier. B. Over the same period of time, Xiphophorus embryos attain a larger size than Platypoecilus embryos. The growth rates of the hybrids all coincide with or exceed those of Xiphophorus. C. Caudal fin differentiation is one stage later in Xiphophorus than in Platypoecilus. However, all the hybrids form a caudal fin at the same rate as P. maculatus, and the F[subscript 1] X Platypoecilus backcross hybrid embryos exceed both parental species in this respect. 6. Sterility and embryonic anomalies are frequent among hybrid females. This is particularly true of F[subscript 1] females possessing the Sd (spotted dorsal fin) character, indicating a linkage of lethal factors with this pattern gene.

T1  - Allometric trends and locomotor adaptations in the Bovidae.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 179
SP  - 199
N2  - This study examines two factors which affect the dimensions of the postcranial skeleton of Bovidae: physical constraints of increasing size and adaptations to particular habitats or modes of locomotion. Total limb lengths, lengths of proximal bones, diameters, and areas of long bones all scale more or less predictably with body size. All lengths scale with negative allometry, whereas areas and diameters vary from slightly negative to positive, depending on the bone. Comparisons of exponents of the scaling relationships to expectations of geometric and elastic scaling theory show that bovids do not scale geometrically, and in some dimensions seem to scale elastically. However, elastic factors cannot be the sole physical constraint governing scaling since many dimensions differ significantly from elastic theory. In addition, some limb elements show changes in gross morphology which violate the assumptions of elastic theory. Length of radius, metacarpal, and metatarsal do not scale predictably with body weight; adaptations to particular habitats are more important in determining lengths of these bones than is body size. Species found in open or grasslands habitats tend to have long limb elements relative to body weight, those in mountainous regions have relatively short limb elements, and those in woodland regions have intermediate length distal elements.

T1  - Brachiopods of the Onondaga Limestone in central and southeastern New York.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 179
SP  - 293
N2  - Thirty-nine species of brachiopods from central and southeastern New York are systematically described. This monograph is based upon 7030 specimens collected from 30 localities and includes silicified as well as nonsilicified faunas. The following members of the Onondaga Limestone were sampled: Edgecliff, Nedrow, Moorehouse, and Seneca. The Onondaga thickens considerably toward the east with the greatest net change occurring in the Moorehouse Member (19 ft. near Syracuse to 92 ft. at Saugerties). The Seneca Member disappears just east of Cherry Valley and is not found in any strata of the mid-Hudson Valley. Crinoid columnals up to about 1 inch in diameter are characteristic of the Edgecliff Member across the state but become less abundant in the east. Brachiopod diversity is greatest in the Moorehouse Member and least in the Edgecliff Member. Of the 26 species of brachiopods in the underlying Bois Blanc Formation in western New York, nine occur in the Onondaga and show no evolutionary change. Morphologic variability in the Onondaga faunas was greater laterally than vertically. For the species studied here, the high degree of stasis in the Bois Blanc-Onondaga (Emsian-Eifelian) time interval may support a punctuational model as an evolutionary mode. During Eifelian time the faunas found in central and southeastern new York belonged to the Appohimchi Subprovince of the Eastern Americas Realm and were part of the larger suite extending westward across the continent. The Onondagan brachiopods reviewed here were provincial in character with the following genera endemic to the Appohimchi Subprovince: Charionoides, 'Pacificocoelia,' and Pentagonia. Atribonium halli and Discomyorthis? sp. are the only species described herein not previously reported from Onondaga strata. No new species or genera were erected.

VL  - 100
SP  - 397
N2  - Systematic notes on a large collection of birds made on three of the four islands in the Gulf of Guinea, West Africa ... by Mr. and Mrs. J.G. Correia are presented. Complete lists of the land and fresh-water birds of the four islands are given, and it is indicated which forms are endemic on the various islands, and which races (three in number) are described from the islands (in every case Fernando Po) as new in this paper. In addition, Cyanomitra cyanolaema octaviae and Oriolus nigripennis alleni are described as new from the mainland of West Africa. The following additional taxonomic changes are proposed: that the genera Lampribis and Hagadashia be united with Bostrychia; that Creciscus be united with Crex; that the following races, usually synonymized, be recognized: Accipiter castanilius beniensis, Tyto alba poensis, Stizorhina fraseri rubicunda from West Africa to separate it from the nominate race, which proves to be restricted to Fernando Po, Chalcomitra rubescens stangerii from Fernando Po, Malimbus rubricollis rufovelatus from Fernando Po, and Lamprocolius splendidus lessoni from Fernando Po. Two insular kingfishers, thomensis and nais, of the genus Alcedo (Corythornis) are made races of leucogaster, rather than of cristatus. Fernando Po has an avifauna like that of West Africa with which it was once united, but less rich. Isolation has been great enough to produce endemic races in about 30 percent of the resident species, but there is only one endemic species and no endemic genus. Principe and São Tomé are much more isolated and were never connected with the mainland, from which they differ ecologically to a considerable extent. A number of endemic species and a few endemic genera, as well as endemic races, are found on these two islands. Two of the genera, one genus from each island, are distinct enough to offer some difficulties as regards family assignment. Principe and São Tomé share a number of endemic species, yet each has a number of characteristic endemics lacking on the other. Faunal relationships to Fernando Po are very slight, and each of the three islands has, to a large extent, derived its fauna independently from the mainland. No consistent trends in color character are apparent in the avifaunas of these islands. The birds of Fernando Po are often slightly larger and longer billed than those of West Africa. On Principe and São Tomé similar trends are noticeable and have progressed further, so that several of the endemic forms are very large for the groups in which they belong. But there are exceptions, for example, the dwarf ibis of São Tomé (Bostrychia bocagei). None of the environmental rules seems adequate to explain the trend towards larger size in such a large segment of the birds of the Gulf islands, and it is suggested that intraspecific rivalry for mates or for food under insular conditions (empty ecological niches, relative absence of predation) may have selected for increased size. In a few cases only, where double colonizations are involved, does interspecific competition appear to have been important in this respect. In such cases, one of a pair of competing species will, of course, be selected for smaller rather than larger size. Increase in size of the bill, a common phenomenon in these insular birds, is in some cases due to allometric correlation with general size. In other cases it may be due to direct selection for a larger bill, either for feeding or for gaining dominance over other individuals of the same species. 'Compensation' may be involved. The São Tomé giant sunbird, Cyanomitra thomensis, is shown to be an excellent example of several aspects of allometry and also of the increase in sexual dimorphism in size which, as Rensch has recently pointed out, often characterizes the larger species of a related group.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 173
SP  - 1
N2  - The genus Drasyllus is redefined to include those gnaphosids with a preening comb on metatarsi III and IV, closely spaced posterior median eyes, and a medially situated, bifid terminal apophysis on the male palp, and is hypothesized to be the sister group of Camillina. The 59 known American species, found from southern Canada to Mexico, are placed in eight species groups. Keys, disgnoses, descriptions, illustrations, scanning electron micrographs, locality records, and distribution maps are provided. Zelotes mexicanus (Banks) is transferred to Drasyllus. Drasyllus novus (Banks) and D. dromeus Chamberlin are removed from the synonymy of D. frigidus (Banks) and D. orgilus Chamberlin, respectively, and considered valid. Fourteen specific names are newly synonymized: D. zelotoides (Worley) and D. moronius (Chamberlin), both with D. lamprus (Chamberlin); D. finium Chamberlin and D. dentelifer Chamberlin, both with texamans Chamberlin; D. sporadicus Muma with D. dixinus Chamberlin; D. virginianus Chamberlin with D. novus (Banks); D. ostegae Chamberlin with D. aprilinus (Banks); D. lutzi Chamberlin and D. devexus Chamberlin, both with D. dromeus Chamberlin; D. monicus Chamberlin with D. proclesis Chamberlin; D. lasalus Chamberlin and Gertsch and D. hubbelli Chamberlin and Gertsch, both with D. mexicanus (Banks); and D. mephisto Chamberlin and D. coahuilanus Gertsch and Davis, both with D. lepidus (Banks). The males of D. eremitus Chamberlin, D. nannellus Chamberlin and Gertsch, D. seminolus Chamberlin and Gertsch, D. lamprus (Chamberlin), D. louisianus Chamberlin, D. orgilus Chamberlin, D. arizonensis (Banks), D. saphes Chamberlin, and D. fractus Chamberlin, and the females of D. socius Chamberlin, D. inanus Chamberlin and Gertsch, D. eremophilus Chamberlin and Gertsch, D. ellipes Chamberlin and Gertsch, and D. prosaphes Chamberlin are described for the first time. Twenty-three new species are described from the southern United States and Mexico.

T1  - Recent and fossil clupeomorph fishes with materials for revision of the subgroups of clupeoids.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 181
SP  - 235
N2  - The Clupeomorpha are a diverse, widespread group of fishes containing (as defined here) about 317 Recent and over 150 known fossil species. They are known as far back as the early Cretaceous and today are worldwide in distribution. Surprisingly little is known about this group phylogenetically. This study briefly reviews past work on clupeomorph interrelationships and examines the skeletal morphology of clupeomorphs to produce materials for a revision of the subgroups of clupeiform fishes. By concentrating on clupeomorph osteology, fossils can be added to the resulting classification. Comparative osteological data, based on examination of over 750 skeletal preparations, are summarized by 20 tables and several cladograms. The osteology of a pellonuline (Odaxothrissa vittata) and dorosomatine (Dorosoma cepedianum) is descriptively illustrated in detail. Also, a list of all nominal fossil species known to the author which appear to belong in Clupeomorpha as defined here, is provided (based on examination of either illustrations or specimens of over 150 fossil species), and the species in this list are briefly discussed. It was found that several skeletal characters define groups such as Clupeomorpha, Clupeomorpha Division 2, Clupeiformes, Clupeoidei, and some clupeoid subgroups. Based on osteological characters, the family Pristigasteridae should be excluded from the superfamily Clupeoidea (which includes Chirocentridae and Clupeidae); and the groups Pristigasteroidea, Engrauloidea, Clupeoidea, Clupeidae, Pellonulinae, and Dussumieriinae were each found to be monophyletic. Several fossil groups are removed from Clupeomorpha (†Ornategulum, †Clupavidae, †Engraulis evolans, and others). Cladograms for Pristigasteroidea, Dussumieriinae, and Pellonulinae are given based on osteological characters. No osteological characters were discovered to indicate that Dorosomatinae, Alosinae, Clupeinae, or these three groups together, are monophyletic. The biggest remaining problem in clupeomorph systematics is seen as discovering the interrelationships of the members of these three subfamilial 'groups of convenience' among Clupeoidei. It is hoped that this work will serve as a base for future phylogenetic studies on clupeomorph fishes by paleoichthyologists and neoichthyologists interested in clupeomorph osteology. The interrelationships of clupeid fishes and the placement of many fossil species within Clupeomorpha are still under study.

T1  - Comparative myology of the pectoral and pelvic appendages of the North American porcupine (Erethizon dorsatum) and the prehensile-tailed porcupine (Coendou prehensilis).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 173

N2  - The myology of the pectoral and pelvic appendages of Erethizon dorsatum, the North American porcupine, and Coendou prehensilis, the prehensile-tailed porcupine, were compared by dissection. The data were used to hypothesize on the evolutionary relationship of these two species, and the arboreal adaptations within their musculature were identified. Arboreal adaptations were observed most frequently in the forelimb. Several muscles may be important in caudal rotation of the scapula, a monement that is probably used as an aid to limb protraction during reaching movements. The cranial fibers of M. acromiotrapezius and the caudal fibers of the M. levator scapulae and M. serratus anterior complex probably function in caudal scapular rotation, but it is possible that the latter would be important in suspension of the thorax by the pectoral girdle during climbing. The cranial fibers of the M. levator scapulae and M. serratus anterior complex along with M. occipitoscapularis, M. rhomboideus anterior, and M. atlantoscapularis posterior would be used in cranial scapular rotation (the glenoid moves caudoventrally). This motion is probably used as an aid to limb retraction during climbing. M. latissimus dorsi and M. teres major have configurations which also reflect the need for powerful limb retraction in erethizontids. Several muscles, particularly M. pectoralis major and M. clavodeltoideus, are responsible for limb adduction in order to maximize the frictional forces generated between the manus and the arboreal substrate. the configuration of M. biceps brachii indicates that it is a powerful elbow flexor and an important supinator of the antebrachium. M. supinator is probably most important in maintaining the integroty of the humeroradial joint. Arboreal adaptations in the pelvic appendage were primarily concerned with positioning the pes or improving its grasping capabilities. M. tibialis anterior and M. tibialis posterior are important for inversion of the pes toward the medially lying arboreal substrate. M. plantaris brevis and M. adductor ossis sesamoideus medialis would probably depress the preaxial pad, allowing the pes to 'grasp' branches or conform to the curved substrate. The musculature of the pectoral appendages of Erethizon and Coendou was found to be similar, although some minor interspecific differences were observed. However, major interspecific differences were observed in the pelvic appendages of these animals. M. caudofemoralis and M. adductor digiti secundi are present in Erethizon but absent in Coendou. The configuration of M. flexor digitorum tibialis and M. abductor hallucis brevis in Coendou are clearly derived from the more primitive conditions as represented by Erethizon. The myological data obtained in this study, along with other morphological and paleontological data from Frazer (1978), suggest that Erethizon and Coendou were derived from a common ancestor.

Crunomys fallax is from Luzon; C. rabori, new species, occurs on Leyte; C. melanius lives on Mindanao; and C. celebensis, new species, is native to middle altitudes in mountainous Central Sulawesi. The species are described and contrasted with one another. Crunomys is related to Archboldomys, new genus and species, a small-bodied shrew rat from southeastern Luzon. That rat is described, compared with species of Crunomys, then contrasted with the three species of small-bodied shrew rats endemic to Central Sulawesi: Melasmothrix naso, Tateomys rhinogradoides, and T. macrocercus, new species. Relationships among the four genera are discussed. Insular and altitudidinal distributions are also presented as well as some data on habitats and habits.

T1  - A generic revision of flycatchers of the tribe Muscicapini.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 100
SP  - 457
N2  - This paper is a generic study of 113 species of flycatchers of the tribe Muscicapini, about one-third of the species computed for the subfamily Muscicapinae by Mayr and Amadon (1951). Twelve genera with five subgenera are recognized, a list of which is given on page 473 together with a brief synopsis giving the number of species in each genus, its general distribution, and characters. Of the 12 genera three (Horizorhinus, Newtonia, and Culicicapa) are of uncertain affinities. The first which is monotypic is restricted to Principe Island in the Gulf of Guinea and, though provisionally included in the Muscicapini in this study, is often considered to be a babbler but may possibly be a warbler or a thrush. The second, from Madagascar, although aberrant, is probably a member of the Muscicapini and may be distantly related to Muscicapa. The affinities of the third, which consists of two Indo-Malayan species, are perhaps with the Rhipidurini rather than with the Muscicapini. In these three genera the young are not spotted. The other genera can be divided in two groups, with the Indo-Malayan genus Rhinomyias intermediate. The first group which consists of Bradornis and related genera is Ethiopian and comprises more primitive species that are usually heavily built and in which the flycatcher habits are not well developed, these species usually dropping down to the ground to feed, though two species (separated as Fraseria) are arboreal. The second group consists of Muscicapa and related genera and comprises the true flycatchers, the species differing, however, in their feeding or other habits or in the height at which they feed. The main genera recognized in this group are Ficedula, Niltava, Muscicapa, and Microeca, these genera ranging widely as a group throughout the Ethiopian, Palearctic, Indo-Malayan, and Australo-Papuan regions. The variations in the morphological characters and habits are discussed in an introductory section. The large majority of the structural (functional) characters as distinct from the pattern and coloration of the plumage appear to be adaptive and are of dubious phylogenetic significance. The feeding habits, however, are not always diagnostic either, for they occasionally vary between species that are obviously closely related. These differences in habits may be correlated with adaptive differences in structure, but in some species, the habits of which vary geographically with changing ecological conditions, the morphological characters do not change. For instance, an arboreal or semi-arboreal species (as in the genus Niltava) which occupies open country in a region where exposed hunting perches are available may live in thickets, dense undergrowth, or mangrove in another region where such perches are not available. Or a species may live on the seaboard in one region and in mountains in another. Coloration and pattern are generally far more conservative than the structural characters and feeding habits. All the characters are weighed together. Functional characters, coloration and pattern, and habits are considered to be equally valid for generic separation, but the emphasis on certain characters, or a complex of characters and habits, must shift in order not to obscure the evident natural relationships of the species. Throughout this study chief consideration is given to the preservation of such relationships. Most of the genera recognized are quite or relatively homogeneous, but in Ficedula a number of more or less closely related subgroups can be distinguished, some of them representing, perhaps, polyphyletic elements. The Ethiopian genus Parisoma is omitted from this study, although this genus is usually placed in the Muscicapini not far from Muscicapa. However, as stated in the introduction, where this genus is briefly discussed, Parisoma appears to be a composite and unnatural group made up of species which do not seem to be related to the Muscicapinae, some of them being almost certainly warblers which several authors have suggested should be placed in or near Sylvia. The nomenclatural aspects of this study are listed in the appendix.

N2  - One. The acrodont amphisbaenids have been studied, and detailed descriptions are presented of the integument, skull and mandible, cervical vertebrae, hyoid, and shoulder girdles of four of the six species. Brief comments are made on the degree of lung reduction and nature of dermal innervation. 2. Forms recognized are (forms of which no specimens were available are marked with an asterisk, *): Trogonophis wiegmanni Kaup; Pachycalamus brevis Günther; Diplometopon zarudnyi Nikolski; Agamodon anguliceps Peters; *Agamodon compressus Mocquard; *Agamodon arabicus Anderson. 3. The subspecies A. anguliceps immaculatus Calabresi, placed in A. compressus by Loveridge (1941), is returned to its original species. 4. Reasons are presented for considering the acrodont forms as a distinct subfamily, the Trogonophinae, clearly separated from other amphisbaenids by a number of structural characters and a special mode of digging. 5. The problems encountered by burrowing species are analyzed on a theoretical basis. The theoretical analysis is tested on the basis of observations on the Florida amphisbaenid species Rhineura floridana Baird. The possible burrowing mode of the Trogonophinae is analyzed on the basis of differences from the pattern exhibited by rhineurine species.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 174
SP  - 99
N2  - The genus Zelotes is redefined to include those gnaphosids with a preening comb on metatarsi III and IV and an intercalary sclerite situated prolaterally between the tegulum and terminal apophysis on the male palp. The 58 known American species, found from Alaska and northern Canada to southern Mexico and Jamaica, are placed in three species groups with 13 subgroups. Cladograms, keys, diagnoses, descriptions, illustrations, scanning electron micrographs, locality records, and distribution maps are provided. The American species Z. fratris is removed from the synonymy of the European Z. subterraneus (C.L. Koch), but three other European species (Z. kodaensis Miller and Buchar, Z. pallidus (O.P.-Cambridge), and Z. nilicola (O.P.-Cambridge)) are newly recorded from America. Apparently introduced populations of the southwestern species Z. reformans Chamberlin are newly recorded from Peru and Hawaii. Eleven specific names are newly synonymized: Z. pallidenotatus Mello-Leitão with Eilica modesta Keyserling; Z. chicano Gertsch and Riechert with Z. lasalanus Chamberlin; Z. inheritus Kaston with Z. pullus (Bryant); Z. pullatus fox with Z. tuobus Chamberlin; Z. calvanisticus Chamberlin and Z. protestans Chamberlin, both with Z. monachus Chamberlin; Z. omissus Chamberlin with Z. perditus Chamberlin; Z. montereus Chamberlin with Z. discens Chamberlin; Z. nannus Chamberlin and Gertsch with Z. nannodes Chamberlin; Z. kodaensis Miller and Buchar with Z. puritanus Chamberlin; and Z. circumspectus (Simon) with Z. pallidus (O.P.-Cambridge). The males of Z. gynethus Chamberlin, Z. discens Chamberlin, Z. mayanus Chamberlin and Ivie, Z. monodens Chamberlin, and Z. reformans Chamberlin, and the females of Z. pullus (Bryant), Z. pseustes Chamberlin, Z. anglo Gertsch and Riechert, Z. petrophilus Chamberlin, and Z. nilicola (O.P.-Cambridge) are described for the first time. Thirty new species are described.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 174
SP  - 196
N2  - A remarkably well-preserved molluscan fauna in the Solsville Member (Marcellus Formation) of the Chenango Valley, New York, provides a rare opportunity to explore the functional morphology, paleoecology, and systematic relationships of several poorly understood Devonian bivalve taxa. Over 350 recrystallized shells and internal molds from several localities in Madison County, New York, were collected and prepared for this study. The majority of these provide valuable new data on hinge, ligament, adductor and byssal/pedal musculature, and pallial morphology. Ten genera and 14 species are represented. Only one new taxon is recognized, Nuculoidea deceptriformis, new species. Study affirms the contention of Williams (1886) and McAlester (1962a) that large numbers of specific and generic names applied to Devonian bivalves are biologically meaningless owing to taxonomic oversplitting by early authors. The nomenclatural chaos inherited from them evidently stems from (1) lack of adequate morphological data, especially on the hinge and internal features; (2) definitions too narrowly based, i.e., often on as few as one or two specimens; (3) broad variation introduced by preservational differences or different postdepositional histories; (4) the failure of early authors to stress genetic, ecophenotypic and ontogenetic shell variations; (5) parochialism among past authors resulting in few transatlantic comparisons of European and American species. With these observations in mind, the erection of new names has been largely avoided. Generic usages have been reviewed and, in most instances, revised. Roughly 150 evaluations and comparisons of other North American and European species have been incorporated using the improved morphologic data supplied by the Solsville collection as a basis for comparison. About 160 possible synonyms have been suggested; 73 of these are new. In several instances more familiar North American names are superseded by earlier European ones. Paloecologic reconstruction of the Solsville suggests two distinctive nearshore marine deltaic bivalve communities: (1) the Gosseletia community dominated by epifaunal and semi-infaunal byssate filter feeders associated with arenaceous sediments, and (2) the Nuculoidea community characterized by abundant deposit feeders in more argillaceous substrates. An autecological interpretation of each taxon is provided. Biogeographic comparisons with several other Devonian faunas in North America and Europe are investigated. Evidence suggests that (1) the Appalachian and Midwestern North American taxa of the Middle Devonian are closely allied with the Lower to Middle Devonian of central Europe; (2) the Michigan Basin fauna contains numerous North American endemics; and (3) Western North American taxa have fewer relations to Appalachian taxa than earlier authors have supposed.

Three subfamilies are retained: the Furnariinae (with five genera and 35 species), the Synallaxinae (with 17 genera and 116 species), and the Philydorinae (with 12 genera and 63 species). For each genus a key to species and detailed descriptions of every species are provided together with their geographical ranges. Data on measurements are summarized in 24 tables, and information on distribution is summarized in 55 maps. A series of 10 color plates illustrates 107 birds representing 33 of the 34 genera.

T1  - Tylocephalonyx, a new genus of North American dome-skulled chalicotheres (Mammalia, Perissodactyla).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 164
SP  - 1
N2  - Tylocephalonyx, new genus, which includes a single species, T. skinneri, is known from a quantity of material, including skulls and nearly complete postcranials from the Sheep Creek Formation (Nebraska) and the Split Rock vertebrate fauna (Wyoming). The most impressive morphological feature of T. skinneri is its domed skull; but dental, pedal, and other characters are also improtant in defining the species and determining its affinities and habits. Additional material of Tylocephalonyx from Oregon, Montana, Utah, and Colorado closely resembles T. skinneri but is too incomplete for definite reference. The morphology of Tylocephalonyx is compared with that of the well-known chalicothere species Moropus elatus, but similarities to Moropus matthewi, Moropus merriami, and Ancylotherium (Ancylotherium) pentelicum, are also noted. Tylocephalonyx belongs to the chalicotheriid subfamily Schizotheriinae and shows special affinities to the genera Moropus, Phyllotillon, and Ancylotherium. A discussionn of further relationships is inconclusive; Tylocephalonyx may have originated from near the common stem of Moropus, Phyllotillon, and Ancylotherium. Floral/faunal associations suggest that Tylocephalonyx lived in moist temperate forests of northwestern North America but also had a significant distribution onto the Great Plains, perhaps associated with riparian communities. Its range appears to have differed from that of contemporary Moropus, which is rarely or never found in the same deposits and is found in more open woodland associations. The morphology of Tylocephalonyx is consistent with browsing habits and possibly for rearing up on the hindlimbs during feeding as was proposed for other schizotheriines by Borissiak (1945) and Schaub (1943). Many aspects of the habits of Tylocephalonyx, however, are still obscure.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 167
SP  - 121
N2  - We analyze the interrelationships of the several groups of hornless ruminants and show which of them lie nearest the higher ruminants. The phylogenetic progression within Ruminantia proceeds from Hypertragulidae through Tragulidae to Leptomerycidae to Gelocidae to Moschidae and thence to the horned ruminants. Archaeomeryx of the late Eocene is recognized as a primitive member of the Leptomerycidae; the living Tragulidae actually represent a more primitive ruminant stock. We introduce the name Moschina for the Gelocidae and the Moschidae and the  term Eupecora for the higher ruminant groups bearing horns, antlers, and ossicones. We also propose Neoselenodontia, above the subordinal level, to include both the Ruminantia and their sister group, the Tylopoda. The stratigraphic records of the five lower ruminant families appear relatively complete with the exception of the Tragulidae, which are poorly known prior to the Miocene. The exclusively North American distribution of the family Hypertragulidae and many of the Tylopoda suggests that the Ruminantia may have originated in North America. The Tragulidae, exclusively Old World and predominantly subtropical, presumably originated by colonization and isolation in the Old World. Thereafter ruminant evolution centered in the Old World, but representatives of every major group reached North America.

T1  - Frogs and lizards from the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 165
SP  - 390
N2  - The Huon Peninsula forms the eastern end of the Finisterre-Saruwaged mountainous region, nearly 300 km. long, which rises to 4000 m. above the sea and nearly that far above adjacent lowlands. Thirty-eight species of frogs and 52 of lizards are recorded from the peninsula, many of them for the first time. Endemism is slight: none of the lizards and only three of the frog species appear to be endemic. Most of the lizards (92%) and frogs (54% of non-endemic species) are lowland forms, although many of these range into uplands as well. Populations of four species of lizards and 16 of frogs evidently are disjunct from conspecific populations elsewhere, almost all of which are in mountains to the southwest of the Peninsula, across the Ramu-Markham River Valley. The disjunct species are ones with lower elevational limits at about 1000-1400 m., some lower. Frog species restricted to high mountain forests or grasslands elsewhere in New Guinea are absent from the Peninsula. Geological evidence indicates that the mountain mass of which the Huon Peninsula is part has undergone 3000 m. of uplift since the late Pliocene, and that for part of its existence the area was insular. In the Pleistocene, glaciers existed on the highest peaks, montane grassland expanded and cooler temperatures prevailed. It is hypothesized that these altered climatic conditions permitted immigration of such upland species as are present and now, with changed climate, exist in disjunct populations. Climate did not charge sufficiently to permit immigration of high montane species. Lowland species--especially skinks--would have become established shortly after the land mass first appeared above the sea, and the more balanced lowland fauna would have been achieved when the Ramu-Markham area became dry land. The scarcity of endemic forms suggests that the Finisterre-Saruwaged region has not been isolated long enough or continuously enough to permit speciation of isolated populations. The frog and lizard faunas provide no evidence of a former land connection between New Britain and the Huon Peninsula, and the scarcity of lowland New Guinea frog species in New Britain argues against any such connection. One new species of microhylid frog--Cophixalus pipilans--is described, and distributional, ecological, and systematic notes are given for many of the species.

N2  - In a revision of the subtribe Dolicaonina of the Paederinae, descriptions, illustrations, and a key are presented for the three genera and 78 species in the New World. Acaratopus is described as a new genus with one new species, edenus, from Mexico. Stenopholea is redescribed and nine new species are described; they are bifurca, hadra, luma, sarma, thyma, and trunca from Brazil, papola from Ecuador, and aega and libra from Mexico. Gnathymenus is redescribed and 51 new species are added; they are flatrus, hyllus, kapetus, pipus, stubbus, twapicus, twelfus, and volcanus from Chile, avisoideus, brerus, cleofanus, divisus, garus, limus, mergus, prolixus, siagonus and speccus from Colombia, bobelus, gomphus, plancus, radulus, scoliodontus, setosus, umbus and zarzus from Brazil, angulus, geocus, kestrus, nacodus, spereus and tungus from Ecuador, fiscus and simatus from Venezuela, ascus, catillus, clinus, culebrus, falcatus, pandus, raius, ramosus, sifrus and spirus from Panama, and buganus, hamulus, lirellus, nutatus, patulus, somphus, and virgosus from Mexico. Lithocaon Sharp, Litozoon Bierig, Xanthornobium Scheerpeltz, and Macrognathymenus Coiffait and Saiz are new junior synonyms of Gnathymenus. Gnathymenus macropterus (Bierig) is a new junior synonym of Gnathymenus intermedius (Bierig). Xanthornobium vogelsangi Scheerpeltz, Dolicaon klimai Bernhauer, Litozoon maritimus Bierig, Litozoon intermedius Bierig, Litozoon macropterus Bierig, Litozoon nevermanni Bierig, Litozoon progenitor Bierig, Lithocaon fenyesi Bernhauer, and Lithocaon sparsus Sharp are transferred to Gnathymenus and Dolicaon distans Sharp is transferred to Lobrathium. The 14 Old World genera are briefly discussed. Cladograms are presented for three subtribes of the Paederinae, the 17 genera of the Dolicaonina, and all of the species of Dolicaonina for the New World. The presence of protibial combs is used to help define the Paederinae and to suggest relationship of the Paederinae to the Xantholinini of the Staphylininae. The Dolicaonina and Paederina are sister taxa and together form the sister group of the Cryptobiina. The Dolicaonina are defined by the compressed, pubescent, apically truncate fourth segment of the maxillary palpus, the enlarged, medially fused mesothoracic peritremes, and the medially fused genital sclerites of the female. The cladograms for the species and genera are largely unresolved. The three New World genera are defined by characters of the aedeagus. To avoid a polyphyletic classification, three genera are recognized since each is related to a different Old World genus. The New World species are found from northern Mexico to southern Chile where most have been collected from ground litter and debris at elevations up to 11,600 ft. (3536 m.). More than 60 percent of the species are flightless and have reduced eyes. This study of 78 species is based on 885 specimens from 87 localities.

T1  - Breeding birds and old field succession on fallow Long Island farmland.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 168
SP  - 1
N2  - A combination of both the horizontal and vertical approaches to the study of avian succession was applied over a 20-year period in research on the breeding birds of fallow farmland in Long Island, New York. Eight fields, representing stages in secondary plant succession from bare soil to a field 45 years old, varied in size from 0.41 to 1.88 hectares. Botanical data on average cover of herbaceous species and upright woody species, and on the density of trees by height class and by diameter characterize the vegetation of each study area. Breeding bird censuses were counts of all individuals, not indices to or estimates of population size. Particular attention was given to nest location and construction and to light readings taken at the nests to provide an index of relative nest cover. The sequence in which bird species became established in these fields was: red-winged blackbird, song sparrow, field sparrow, indigo bunting, common yellowthroat, blue-winged warbler, gray catbird, brown thrasher, and rufous-sided towhee. This is the same sequence of species derived by an arrangement in order of increasing cover at the nest. Likewise, this is the order in which these same species disappear from the continuum of communities that characterizes old field succession on Long Island. The concordance among these three sequences suggests that species-specific requirements with respect to cover at the nest plays an important role in determining which stages of old field succession a species finds attractive for nesting. There was a rapid increase in species diversity with an increase in age of the fields, and a leveling-off in numbers of territorial species from about 15 years (open shrubland) to 40 years (dense shrubby woodland) after cultivation. A more mature oak woodland in the same region (60 years after clear-cutting) had a greater species diversity than that of any earlier stage of old field succession. This progressive increase in species diversity with succession from herbaceous fields to mature forest is consistent with the findings of others. The density of breeding birds continued to increase beyond that age at which species diversity began to level off (about 15 years after cultivation) and did not reach peak density until another 15 years had elapsed. Density within the more mature oak woodland was significantly less than that of the 30- to 40-year old shrubby woodland. Whether or not there is a decline in density of breeding birds as succession approaches climax probably is determined by the relative availability of moisture. Other investigators have confirmed that in the more xeric successions, such as described in this study, a decline in density is the rule. In the more mesic successions, density is higher in the forest than in the intermediate shrubland stage. Species diversity and density were significantly lower in study areas where succession was arrested than in those permitted to revegetate naturally.

VL  - 168
SP  - 63
N2  - The history of the systematics of Sminthopsis is reviewed. A terminology is defined for the skull, dentition, foot, and other external structures. Important dental characters include the size of the canines, premolar width, width and length of molars, anterior cingula, reduction of the paracone, development of the entoconid and orientation of metacristids and hypocristids. Two subgenera, Sminthopsis and Antechinomys, and the following species in each are recognized: S. murina (including albipes, fuliginosa, and tatei); S. ooldea, new rank; S. leucopus (including ferruginifrons, mitchelli, and leucogenys); S. virginiae (including nitela, rufigenis, lumholtzi, and rona); S. macroura (including froggatti, larpinta, stalkeri, and monticola); S. hirtipes; S. granulipes; S. psammophila; S. butleri; S. douglasi; S. longicaudata; S. crassicaudata (including centralis and ferruginea); subgenus Antechinomys: S. laniger (including spenceri). Other unique populations that may prove to be species are known from the George Gill Range, Northern Territory, and Doomadgee Mission, Queensland. Most species exhibit geographic variation and this is described as subspecies of each respective species. Some variation appears to be clinal within geographically widespread species, such as Sminthopsis murina. Size, tail length, tympanic wing development, brachycephaly, palatal fenestration, interorbital width, crowding of the premolar toothrow, and development of entoconids appear to vary as a function of relative aridity, both within and between species. This variation occurs independently in several different species groups. Sminthopsis granulipes and S. ooldea represent morphological extremes within the genus, the former possessing many structurally ancestral characters and the latter exhibiting the most derived characters--those adapted to arid environments. The species of Sminthopsis are most like those of Ningaui but also show similarity to species of Neophascogale and Phascolosorex.

N2  - Four groups of murid rodents that were once included in Rattus are taken out of that genus: the Rattus niviventer-group from Southeast Asia and the Sunda Shelf, which is placed in the genus Niviventer; the Rattus sabanus-group, which comprises the genus Leopoldamys, also occurring in Southeast Asia, the Sunda Shelf, and the Mentawai Islands; Rattus ohiensis from Ceylon, which is placed in Srilankamys, new genus; and the Rattus beccarii-group of Sulawesi for which the new gneus, Margaretamys, is proposed not only for beccarii but also for the new species M. elegans and M. parvus. Anonymomys mindorensis, new genus and species, is proposed for an arboreal rat from Mindoro in the Philippines. The genera are diagnosed, described, compared with others, and their contents discussed. Their possible relationships to Lenothrix, Dacnomys, Chiromyscus, and Maxomys, groups that were either once considered to be part of Rattus or at least Rattus-like, are discussed in the context of their affinities relative to Rattus.

T1  - Lungfishes, tetrapods, paleontology, and plesiomorphy.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 167
SP  - 163
N2  - We conclude that the internal (excurrent) nostril of Recent lungfishes is a true choana, as judged by its comparison with (1) the internal nostril of a Devonian lungfish species which opens through the bony palate internal to an arcade of maxillary and premaxillary teeth; (2) the choana of the Devonian ichthyostegid amphibians, and (3) nostril development in Recent urodeles. The idea that lungfishes might therefore be the sister group of tetrapods is compared with the competing, deeply entrenched theory that rhipidistian fishes and eusthenopterids in particular include the ancestor of tetrapods. Our own theory, derived from study of Recent and fossil material, and an analysis of literature spanning 140 years, is framed in the context of a classification of the main groups of fossil and living gnathostomes: acanthodians, chondrichthyans, cladistians, actinopterygians, rhipidistians, actinistians, dipnoans, and tetrapods. In formulating our proposal we have reviewed the anatomy of the nasal capsule, nostrils and related structures, paired fins and their girdles, dermal bones of the skull, palate and jaw suspension, hyoid and gill arches, ribs and vertebrae, and scale and tooth structure. We hypothesize, in agreement with most nineteenth- and many twentieth-century biologists, and in disagreement with the current paleontological view, that lungfishes are the sister group of tetrapods, and further that actinistians are the sister group of those two, and that Eusthenopteron is the sister group of those three. We also conclude that the characters used formerly to link Eusthenopteron with tetrapods either (1) are primitive for all bony fishes (including cladistians and actinopterygians) or for living gnathostomes (including chondrichthyans); (2) are convergent with those of several groups of gnathostomes; (3) only justify the inclusion of Eusthenopteron in a group with actinistians, dipnoans and tetrapods; or (4) are spurious. We attribute the century of confusion about the structure and position of lungfishes to the traditional paleontological preoccupation with the search for ancestors, to the interpretation of Eusthenopteron in the light of tetrapods and the reciprocal interpretation of fossil amphibians in the light of Eusthenopteron, and to the paleontological predilection for using plesiomorphous characters to formulate schemes of relationships.

T1  - Origin and history of the Erinaceinae and Brachyericinae (Mammalia, Insectivora) in North America.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 171
SP  - 1
N2  - Modern Erinaceidae include the familiar hedgehog, Erinaceus europaeus, the archetypical primitive placental mammal in the minds of many biologists. Now restricted to the Old World, the family flourished in North America during the Miocene when three subfamilies were present there. Restricted to North America, the Brachyericinae seem to have originated on that continent. Both North American genera of Amphechinini (new tribe of the Erinaceinae) are well known in the Old World in earlier Oligocene deposits and hence appear to have immigrated into North America just before their first appearance there in the early Miocene. Area of origin of the Erinaceini may be interpreted as (1) unspecified within Holarctica plus the Ethiopian Region or (2) as external to Holarctica, depending on how the evidence is weighed. The sudden appearance of the tribe over the extent of Holarctica plus the Ethiopian Region at the beginning of the Miocene and the existence of an adequate structural ancestor in North America immediately prior to the time of initial appearance suggests the first interpretation. Counter to this, the presence in the Oligocene of a derived sister group of the Erinaceini (i.e., the Amphechinini) suggests that the tribe existed by that time, probably in an area where adequate collections from that epoch have not been made, e.g., Africa. Van Couvering (1972) has suggested that many forms which suddenly appear in the Miocene record of Europe without known precursors may have existed in Africa during the Oligocene and migrated only after the two continental blocks met in the mid-Cenozoic. Because the African Oligocene record of small mammals is so pitifully poor and a plausible reason exists for expecting that the Erinaceini existed there during that epoch, the second hypothesis appears more probable at this time. Once established in North America in the early Miocene, both the Erinaceinae and Brachyericinae had relatively uneventful histories. Least eventful was that of the Amphechinini, one species (Parvericius montanus) appearing to be conspecific with forms known in the Oligocene of Asia and the other species (Amphechinus horncloudi) differing only slightly from its Old World predecessors and contemporaries in that genus. Although A. horncloudi did not survive the Arikareean when it first appeared, P. montanus persisted with little noticeable change from that age through the Barstovian. Only one species of Erinaceini is recognized, Untermannerix copiosus (new), which appeared in the Barstovian and persisted until the Clarendonian with no noticeable change. More complex was the history of the Brachyericinae. Both genera have two species of markedly different size. In each, the smaller species appears to suddenly replace the larger. In the case of Metechinus, the evidence for this abruptness is equivocal but for Brachyerix it is highly compelling. Most useful in the analysis of the data has been the cladistic method as outlined by Hennig in his 1966 work. It was a fundamental tool in the development of the more plausible second hypothesis of the history of the Erinaceini outlined above. Determination of primitive and derived states or polarity of a given character, a fundamental problem of the cladistic method, was made by analyzing the distribution of the different states among the several groups recognized in an initial, credible higher phylogenetic hypothesis. Character states widely scattered in a haphazard pattern among the groups were regarded as primitive; ones found in only a few groups, particularly when thought to be closely related, were regarded as derived. In cases where the pattern was ambiguous, by restricting the sample examined to forms known prior to an arbitrary geologic epoch, it was often possible to determine polarity in this subset. Because in this procedure one is examining the forms that would have been available had one lived at that earlier, arbitrary date, the methodological pitfalls are no different from examining the total sample including modern forms.

N2  - The neurocranium of the shark Xenacanthus (sensu lato) from the early Permian of Texas shares derived characters with the neurocrania of various other Paleozoic shark genera, including Tamiobatis, 'Cladodus,' 'Ctenacanthus,' Cladoselache, and with Hybodus and the living neoselachians. These characters are consistent with the hypothesis that the above extinct and the living taxa belong to the monophyletic group Elasmobranchii. Xenacanthus and Tamiobatis are proposed as sister taxa related to 'Cladodus' and possibly to 'Ctenacanthus' from the Cleveland shale. The details of Xenacanthus and Tamiobatis cranial morphology are based on three-dimensional specimens, both whole and sectioned'--P. [4].

T1  - Systematics of North American colubrid snakes related to Tantilla planiceps (Blainville).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 171
SP  - 201
N2  - Examination of numerous characters (primarily of head coloration, hemipenes, scutellation, and size and proportions) of more than 750 specimens suggests that Tantilla planiceps, as recognized by Tanner (1966), actually represents four distinct species: Tantilla planiceps (Blainville, 1835), of southern California and Baja California; Tantilla yaquia Smith, 1942, of southeastern Arizona and northwestern Mexico; Tantilla atriceps (Günther, 1895), of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico; and Tantilla hobartsmithi Taylor, '1936' (1937), which is broadly distributed in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico and usually has been considered synonymous with T. atriceps. Synonymies, diagnoses, descriptions, illustrations, range maps, and ecological notes are presented for each of these species. Tantilla atriceps and T. hobartsmithi are sibling species with strikingly different hemipenes. They also are the only species of the complex for which sympatry (in Coahuila) has been documented. Future collecting may well demonstrate sympatry at the periphery of the ranges of T. planiceps and T. hobartsmithi and of T. yaquia and T. hobartsmithi. Analysis of variation indicates that some classical taxonomic characters used previously (e.g., number of ventral scales) are not particularly reliable for distinguishing among species of Tantilla. The best specific characters we found are in anatomy of the hemipenes. Variation in hemipenial features usually is correlated with variation in head coloration. Because T. atriceps and T. hobartsmithi are sibling species, now known to differ consistently only in hemipenial characters, and because they exhibit sympatry at the periphery of their ranges, specific identification of females is a problem that requires additional investigation. Once it appeared that male copulatory organs would provide important, diagnostic characters for the four species formerly assigned to T. planiceps, we examined hemipenes on as many specimens (258) as were reasonably available. These included pertinent type-specimens and outgroup comparisons with T. gracilis, T. nigriceps, and T. wilcoxi; hemipenes of these species are distinctive also, and examples of all are described and illustrated (excepting T. wilcoxi). One problem that remains under investigation is the specific relationship between T. atriceps and southern populations of T. nigriceps. No such problem exists between T. hobartsmithi and T. nigriceps, however, as they differ rather consistently in hemipenes and head coloration, and they are sympatric in the western part of the range of T. nigriceps. We also examined maxillary bones, sex ratio, and karyotypes (including that of T. coronata) in addition to the characters mentioned above. Most of these data are not taxonomically useful, due either to lack of significant variation or lack of comparative data from congeners. A preferred cladogram of phylogenetic relationships of T. wilcoxi, T. planiceps, T. yaquia, T. nigriceps, T. atriceps, T. hobartsmithi, and T. gracilis is presented, as is a key to all species of Tantilla known to occur in the western United States and northern Mexico. The most useful characters for distinguishing species of Tantilla, particularly in North America, appear to be in the hemipenes and head coloration. Hereafter, all taxonomic studies within Tantilla routinely should include examination of hemipenes of the specimens examined. When possible, males should be selected as type-specimens.

N2  - Palache, Berman, and Frondel published two volumes of the seventh edition of James Dwight Dana's System of Mineralogy in 1944 and 1951. As with the sixth edition published in 1892, the seventh edition soon became the recognized authority in mineralogy. Greatly improved analytical techniques, crystal structure analysis, and other new technologies have led to a great increase in the number of new species and to the improvement of the data for older species. Over 400 new nonsilicate species have been approved by the International Mineralogical Association's Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names in the last eight years. For comparison, the seventh edition of Dana's System assigned classification numbers to 1043 accepted species, and briefly described another 227 poorly defined species. Of this total 69 have been discredited and 158 have been redefined. There have been over 1200 new nonsilicate species described in the last 30 years, and the growth continues. Obviously, with the number of nonsilicate species more than doubled since 1951, an updated classification is required. The preparation of this volume began in 1977, when a revised classification of the known phosphate, arsenate and vanadate minerals was prepared and privately circulated. This wa received favorably, so a revised classification of all nonsilicate minerals was undertaken; the results are given here"--P. v.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 162
SP  - 379
N2  - Chiropodomys is an Asian genus of arboreal mice that contains five species. One, C. karlkoopmani, is new and described here; it is represented by a specimen from North Pagai Island in the Mentawai Islands off the west coast of Sumatra. Another, C. major, is found in Sarawak and Sabah. A third, C. calamianensis, occurs in the Palawan area and is known by specimens from the islands of Balabac, Palawan, and Busuanga. The fourth, C. muroides, the smallest in body size within the genus, is represented by a few specimens from Sabah and northern Kalimantan and occurs together with C. major and C. gliroides, the fifth species. The latter has the most extensive geographic range of the five. It is found throughout Indochina (Assam, Burma, southern China, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand), the Malay Peninsula, and on the Sunda Shelf (Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Bali, Nias and Tujuh islands, and the Natuna Islands). The morphological and geographic limits of the five species of Chiropodomys are outlined, some of the geographic variation is described, the available information about their natural histories is summarized, and their taxonomies are revised. Defining characteristics of each species within Chiropodomys is important in order to determine their place in the pattern of zoogeographic alliances among species of murid rodents which occur throughout the Far East, from Indochina to Australia.

N2  - The subfamily Blissinae is defined and the following aspects treated: a historical review, a summary of the biology and feeding habits, a checklist of world species, and an analysis of characters of taxonomic and phylogenetic importance. A proposed phylogeny is presented with cladograms. The distribution of the taxa is discussed and an interpretation is given. Keys are included for adults of all genera and species of the world, and for fifth instar nymphs of all species for which they are known. A diagnosis is given for each genus as well as its original reference, synonymy, type species, and general distribution. A figure is included for at least one species of each genus as well as 170 figures of anatomical details and 19 diagrams showing phylogenetic relationships. Slaterellinae Drake and Davis is placed as a junior synonym  of Blissinae. Blissus navis Slater is transferred to Capodemus, Macropes tinctus Distant to Cavelerius, and Dimorphopterus aleocharoides Jakovlev to Ischnodemus. Neoblissus Bergroth is placed as a junior synonym of Blissus Burmeister. Pseudoblissus is erected as a new genus to contain Blissus trispinosus Slater.

T1  - The genus Sarothrura (Aves, Rallidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 143
SP  - 1
N2  - The small rails comprising the genus Sarothrura form a well-marked group, for which a subfamily, the Sarothrurinae has been proposed. They are familiarly known as flufftails, from the fluffy decomposed tail. There are nine species, seven in Africa, two in Malagasy. 2. Except in S. ayresi, differences in color between the sexes are striking, although there is no difference in size. The male is predominantly black, each species with its characteristic pattern of white or buffy spots or streaks, and with a chestnut head. The female is predominantly black or brown, each species again with its characteristic pattern. Exceptions to the foregoing are that the female of pulchra has the male-like character of a chestnut head; whereas both sexes of watersi are brown, patterning is no more than vestigial, and confined to the female. In rufa, lugens, and boehmi the tail is black; in the other species there is a varying amount of chestnut. In some species at least, molt of the primaries is alternate so that the power of flight is never lost. 3. So far as they are known, the eggs are invariably white, and the nest is usually domed over to conceal them. In some species, at least, despite the color dimorphism, both sexes apparently incubate the eggs. The chicks are clothed in black down, and in some species they have pale markings on the bill, which may serve to emphasize signal movements employed in obtaining food from adults. Immature birds are uniform blackish, with the exception of pulchra, which has some patterning. The immature plumage is quickly replaced by a patterned adult dress, the change perhaps usually starting at an age of only about six weeks. 4. Sarothrura pulchra and elegans are forest and thicket dwellers. The others, including the Malagasy species, insularis and watersi, inhabit swamps or grasslands. Sarothrura affinis has a montane distribution, fragmented under existing climatic conditions. Sarothrura ayresi is probably confined to Ethiopia and to South Africa, although it has not been certainly recorded in the latter area since 1901. It may be represented ecologically in the intervening area by boehmi. No difference in habitat between rufa and lugens has been established. They appear to compete with each other, rufa being in most localities the more successful. 5. In southern Africa at least, breeding is predominantly in the rains. But the scanty data for insularis of Malagasy suggest that it breeds before the rains. There is strong evidence that boehmi is absent from southern Africa in the dry season, which lasts some seven months. In common with another rail, Crex egregia, its habitat is liable to be burnt out. No other Sarothrura is considered to have any regular, long-range movement. 6. Because of its secretiveness, very little, indeed, is known about Sarothrura behavior. But probably all the species have striking song calls during the breeding season. Those of the African species, except ayresi, have been tape recorded by Keith, and a special and pioneer feature of the present paper, so far as African ornithology is concerned, are sonograms of these calls. 7. Subspeciation is lacking in boehmi, ayresi (notwithstanding its fragmented distribution), insularis, and watersi. Color variation is rather slight, except in the female of pulchra. This species also shows a marked tendency to small size, mainly in southern Cameroun, and possibly a manifestation of Bergmann's Rule. There is, however, an inexplicable and striking contrast in size with northern Cameroun birds, and also in the color of the females. Sarothrura rufa also shows a tendency to small size in southern Cameroun and adjacent areas, but is unknown in northern Cameroun. Sarothrura lynesi is regarded as a subspecies of lugens. It only differs in being smaller -- curiously in the colder part of the range of the species. Only two subspecies of affinis are formally recognized, but probably two more will eventually have to be. This involves the collecting of topotypical material of S. affinis antonii, the type of which was destroyed in the troubles in Hungary in 1956. 8. Sarothrura pulchra and rufa are much the best represented species in museum collections, ayresi and watersi, the worst. In general, this is also a reflection of the state of knowledge of these species in life. The only specimens from Ethiopia are 26 of ayresi and one of rufa; from Somalia, one of elegans. Males preponderate over females in collections in a ratio of more than two to one. 9. In the section on phylogeny the species are placed in four groups: (1) pulchra and elegans; (2) rufa, lugens, and boehmi; (3) affinis and insularis; (4) ayresi and watersi. The first two (the pulchra and rufa groups) form the two extremes. The pulchra group is thought to be the most recently evolved and the most advanced. But for the red in the tail, as in the pulchra group, the affinis group could be merged with the rufa group. Sarothrura affinis and insularis form a superspecies. Sarothrura affinis stock may have colonized Malagasy in a colder, wetter regime. The resultant insularis is a successful species, able to exist even at sea level. Sarothrura ayresi and watersi seem less closely related to each other than are affinis and insularis. The early extinction of watersi may be predicted, although ayresi may still be holding its own in Ethiopia.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 144
SP  - 173
N2  - The present paper presents the results of a study on the functional morphology of hind-limb locomotion in the domestic pigeon, Columba livia. The structure and function of the hind-limb joints is discussed first. The major morphological features of the joint are examined using techniques of microscopic and gross anatomy, and these results are correlated with the kinds and amounts of movement permitted at each joint. Next, a detailed description of the hind-limb muscles is presented. Included in the descriptions are data on origins and insertions, the arrangement of the fibers in relation to aponeuroses of origin and insertion, the relative length of the fibers, the angle of pinnation, and information about the histological composition twitch (fibrillenstruktur) and tonus (felderstruktur) fibers within the muscle. The data in the section on muscle description are then used in conjunction with some basic principles of muscle physiology to arrive at more well-founded conclusions as to the functions of the different muscles. A high-speed motion picture analysis of hind-limb locomotion in the pigeon is then given. Three different gaits (moderate walk, slow walk, and a run) are studied and compared with respect to angular displacements and angular velocities. The important aspects of landing are briefly considered. Finally, the results of the functional analysis of the muscles are combined with those of the motion picture analysis to enable the construction of an activity sequence of the muscles during a walk. Information such as when muscles are active during a step and the kinds of motion observed is considered. Certain features of one-joint and multi-joint muscles and of vertebrate joint structure and function are discussed.

T1  - Beginning of the age of mammals in Asia : the late Paleocene Gashato fauna, Mongolia.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 144
SP  - 271
N2  - The earliest Tertiary mammalian fauna known from Asia occurs in southern Mongolia, where it is found in late Paleocene sediments approximately 55 million years old exposed at Gashato and in the Nemegt Basin. Romer (1966) has proposed, but not defined, a 'Gashatan Asiatic Age' for the Gashato fauna and we propose that the term be extended to the occurrence of the same fauna, although to a different faunal facies, in the Nemegt Basin, subsuming Romer's (1966) 'Ulanbulakian Asiatic Age.' We supply a definition of the 'Gashatan Asiatic Age': the joint overlapping time ranges of Palaeostylops, Pseudictops, Prionessus, and Eurymylus. Additional localities in Sinkiang and Kwangtung may also be Gashatan in age. The Gashato fauna is made up of a mixture of endemic genera and a few genera that evidently reached Asia via the Bering route from North America and beyond. There is no special similarity to Paleocene faunas of Europe, but this could be because of a double filtering action. Gashatan mammals have been the notoungulates, but recently Paleocene notoungulates been found in North America and there is no evidence that notoungulates as such originated in Asia. At the beginning of the Eocene (Sparnacian), increased northern dispersal brought about extensive, but still not complete, faunal replacement in eastern Asia. Analysis of geophysical data, as well as the faunal data, suggests that there is strong evidence for a dry-land dispersal route between the North American and European crustal blocks via Greenland and the Barents shelf as late as Sparnacian time in the Eocene, but not thereafter. During Paleocene time, climate and other factors had a filtering effect on dispersal via both the Bering and Greenland-Barents shelf routes, but the former was closer to the rotational pole position in the Paleocene and was a more effective filter. During Sparnacian time, the Bering area still acted as a filter, but the Greenland-Barents shelf route now showed little filter action. Presumably this was the result of a more equable climate. There is no evidence for a Greenland-Iceland-Faeroes dispersal route and some evidence against it. No attempt is made in the present paper to reevaluate, except insofar as they bear on correlation, the Gashatan multituberculates, pseudictopids, eurymylids, Phenacolophus, or pantodonts, but the following taxonomic adjustments are made: 1. Opisthopsalis is synonymized with Sarcodon, and Sarcodon and Hyracolestes are added to the insectivoran family Deltatheridiidae. 2. A new order, Anagalida, is proposed. The Anagalida includes the families Zalambdalestidae, Pseudictopidae, Anagalidae, and Eurymylidae. The Anagalidae are somewhat lagomorph-like and are believed to be related to lagomorphs. 3. Praolestes is referred to the Zalambdalestidae. 4. The Cretaceous genus Zalambdalestes is known from a single species, Z. lechei. The type specimen of Z. lechei is an extremely aged individual with cheek-tooth crowns nearly worn away. P[superscript]1 and P[superscript]2 have dropped out and the alveoli have closed. The type specimen of 'Z. grangeri' is a somewhat younger individual of the same species and the referred specimens in the Polish collections are younger still. New illustrations of American Museum specimens of Zalambdalestes are provided. 5. The Anagalidae are reported from the Paleocene for the first time and a new genus and species, Khashanagale zofiae, is named. A second species of Khashanagale or of a closely related form is present at Gashato, but is not named. 6. A small Dissacus-like mesonychid is present in the Gashato fauna at Gashato. 7. In the classification of uintatheres, utilization of Flerov's subfamily Prodinoceratinae is advocated in preference to Wheeler's subfamily Bathyopsinae.

The many other pre-Pliocene penguins found in New Zealand after that date were monographed by Professor B.J. Marples in 1952. They are here systematically reviewed, with references to previous illustrations and substantive publications, and new data and illustrations are provided. Pre-Pliocene penguins have been found in New Zealand at ten localities or collecting areas. The generically unidentifiable specimen from Gore Bay, previously considered to be from the early Eocene and the oldest known penguin, is in fact Oligocene or early Miocene in age. The oldest known penguins are Pachydyptes ponderosus, Palaeeudyptes marplesi, and Palaeeudyptes sp. from the late Eocene. Other known New Zealand penguins range through the Oligocene and perhaps early Miocene. Within the range late Eocene-early Miocene many specimens are of undeterminable precise age. The reported great range, Kaiatan-Waitakian for the single species Palaeeudyptes antarcticus is not substantiated. The known pre-Pliocene New Zealand penguins are classified in six genera, Palaeeudyptes, Pachydyptes, Platydyptes, Archaeospheniscus, Duntroonornis, and Korora, with nine named species, of which ?Platydyptes marplesi is here new. Among fairly numerous specimens referred to Palaeeudyptes, only the two specific holotypes are considered definitely identifiable to species on the basis of present knowledge. It is unlikely that any of the known genera were ancestral to Recent penguins. Previous attempts at subfamily classification are unsatisfactory, and subfamilies are abandoned here. The New Zealand forms show some, but limited resemblances to the penguin faunas of each of the other three regions where fossils of this family have been found; southern Australia, Seymour Island, and Argentine Patagonia. The largest fossil penguin, Pachydyptes ponderosus, was probably at least 50 per cent taller than the largest Recent penguin and probably weighed about 100 kilograms. In general, known fossil penguins average considerably larger than Recent penguins in the same latitudes. Recent penguins tend to be larger in higher latitudes or colder environments, but there are adaptations to climate other than size and these may be more crucial. Eocene-Miocene penguins did not follow the size-temperature regression of Recent penguins and must have had dissimilar heat regulation. However, all the basic locomotory adaptations of the Spheniscidae were virtually complete in the late Eocene, and the origin of the family must have been much earlier. No earlier, possibly relevant fossils occur in the extremely poor fossil record of birds in the Southern Hemisphere.

N2  - The present study, based on more than 800 specimens in some 40 collections and on a review of all references in the literature, reduces the more than 24 named forms of the South American amphisbaenian genus Leposternon to seven, six of these having been previously named, and the seventh thus far known from only a single specimen. The species Leposternon microcephalum occupies almost the entire generic range, whereas the remaining forms (L. infraorbitale, L. octostegum, L. polystegum, L. scutigerum, L. wuchereri) appear to be more or less sympatric to it. The single, yet unnamed individual of the seventh form stems from Goiás, within the range of L. infraorbitale. The variability of integumentary architecture is much greater in this genus than in those other amphisbaenians thus far examined. The cephalic segmentation of some of the species in particular shows remarkable local variance, and the dermal-vertebral ratio is most irregular, departing drastically from the value of two, which is almost universal in other species of the order; some local variants particularly would seem to provide raw material for several kinds of interesting supplementary studies.

T1  - The Synthetoceratinae (Mammalia, Tylopoda, Protoceratidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 145
SP  - 123
N2  - The subfamily Synthetoceratinae, a group of uniquely horned North American Tertiary ruminants, marks the evolutionary culmination of the family Protoceratidae. In addition to a pair of widely curved postorbital horns this family is characterized by the development of protruding bony plates on the upper surface of the maxillaries that phyletically unite to form a common-trunked rostral horn, a feature that has no parallel among other horned ruminants. Members of the North American endemic subfamily are distributed from South Dakota to Texas, eastward across the Gulf Coast to Florida, and north into New Jersey. Temporally, they ranged from the late Arikareean of the northern Great Plains to the early Hemphillian of the Gulf Coastal Plain. Taxonomic changes within the subfamily, Synthetoceratinae, include (1) the transfer of Syndyoceras from the monotypic subfamily, Syndyoceratinae, to the Synthetoceratinae, (2) the placement of Stirton's genus, Lambdoceras, in synonymy with Prosynthetoceras but retaining it as a subgenus (Prosynthetoceras (Lambdoceras)), and (3) the synonymy of Prosynthetoceras siouxensis dawesensis Frick with Prosynthetoceras (Lambdoceras) siouxensis Frick. As now defined, the subfamily includes three genera: Syndyoceras Barbour, Prosynthetoceras Frick, and Synthetoceras Stirton. Syndyoceras, the earliest occurring genus, is the first protoceratid to possess a single-trunked rostral horn. Monotypic Syndyoceras (S. cooki) is found only in the northern Great Plains. Prosynthetoceras, on the other hand, is by far the most widely dispersed genus in the subfamily, occurring in the Great Plains, and in the Gulf and Atlantic coastal plains. The genus is herein divided into two mostly allopatric subgenera: Prosynthetoceras (Prosynthetoceras), including P. (P.) texanus and P. (P.) francisi, and Prosynthetoceras (Lambdoceras), including P. (L.) hessei, P. (L.) siouxensis and P. (L.) trinitiensis. The type subgenus is restricted to the Gulf Coastal Plain, whereas P. (Lambdoceras) is distributed in both the northern Great Plains and in the Texas Coastal Plain. The latest occurring and most advanced member of the lineage is the monotypic genus Synthetoceras (S. tricornatus), which is restricted to Texas and the Gulf Coastal Plain. Evolutionary changes in the Synthetoceratinae involved (1) increased total body size, (2) increased length of the shaft of the rostral horn, (3) lengthened diastemata, (4) reduced premolars, (5) taller-crowned molars, and (6) reduced lateral metapodials. Whereas early synthetoceratine evolution took place in the Great Plains, an early dispersal, (?early Hemingfordian), brought the ancestors of the Prosynthetoceras lineage to the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain where they eventually spread eastward into Florida and northeastward along the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The P. (Lambdoceras) group, however, remained in the Great Plains during most of its evolutionary history and is recognized only in early Barstovian deposits on the Texas coast. Synthetoceras, the direct descendant of Prosynthetoceras, flourished throughout the Gulf Coastal Plain; some populations spread north into the southern Great Plains, where they are preserved in the Clarendonian of the Texas panhandle, and others persisted, at least in Florida, until the early Hemphillian.

T1  - Biologies of African allodapine bees (Hymenoptera, Xylocopinae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 145
SP  - 221
N2  - A few allodapine bees (genus Halterapis) mass provision their nests, but most feed their larvae progressively. The structure and behavior of larvae and pupae enables them to maintain their positions in the hollow stems in which they live. In common genera such as Braunsapis and Allodape, the arrangement is from youngest below to oldest above. Each larva in these genera is fed by means of provisions placed on its venter by adult bees. In the genus Allodapula, however, larvae are together in a clump instead of one above another and feed from a common food mass. Such matters as positions of eggs, larvae, and pupae, and ways in which larvae are fed, are summarized in the preliminary account of each genus and in the section entitled Allodapine Biology. In the Conclusions are found comments on which of the physiological or behavior characteristics are ancestral and which derived. Social behavior of allodapines is treated both in the Species Accounts and the section on Allodapine Biology. The allodapines are noteworthy for the small sizes of the populations of adults in their colonies and the failure of many nests, even of the more social species, to acquire workers at all. They range from simple subsocial species in which each nest normally contains only a single bee and additional mature adult females are rare and seem almost accidental, to those in which nearly 40 per cent of the nests contain two or more mature adult females. Even in the small and facultative groups of adult females, weak polymorphism arises. This is shown behaviorally in that certain females (workers) do most of the foraging, others (queens) do little foraging when workers are present. The workers often do not mate. Many workers, unlike queens, do not experience much ovarian development, although others do and probably lay some eggs. There is meager evidence that workers are short lived compared to queens. In some species the mean size of workers is less than that of queens. In all these features (except, of course, mating) intermediacy is common and many bees can be placed as to caste only arbitrarily. In an Appendix preliminary descriptions are given for eleven new species falling in the genera Allodape, Braunsapis, Allodapula, and Exoneurula in order to validate names for forms on which biological information is presented.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 145

N2  - The tribe Nacophorini, of the subfamily Ennominae, from the cool and cold temperate region of southern America is revised in the present study. Most of the species occur in the southern Andes Mountains, with nearly all of them occurring in Chile and Argentina. As this group of the Nacophorini differs in some respects from the typical section of the tribe (revised by Rindge, 1961), the two groups are compared, and the present one is defined. In the typical group it was relatively easy to discern phylogenetic trends in a number of adult characters. However, in the group covered herein, this could not be done as the characters seem to form a mosaic, with no really clear-cut pattern of primitive or advanced forms. This is probably due to the presumed relatively recent origin of these moths in a highly varied montane region. Nevertheless, I have tried to arrange the genera in a sequence that is believed to go from the more primitive to the more highly evolved. Seven genera are included in this revision; two of them were originally placed in families other than the Geometridae, namely the Noctuidae and Notodontidae. Three of the seven genera are described as new. A total of 43 species are included; 22 are described as new, plus one heretofore undescribed subspecies. All the genera and nearly all the species are either described or redescribed; comparative notes are given for those taxa that were not personally examined. Distributional information is given for all species insofar as known. Keys are given for all genera and species. The adults and their genitalia are figured for all species and subspecies studied by the author.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 146
SP  - 1
N2  - Fossiliferous sediments of Permian age occupy an area in the Paraná Basin of Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina equivalent to about one and one-half times the size of the Gulf of Mexico. The Estrada Nova Formation, ranging from 100 to 1000 meters thick near the middle of the Permian section, contains a widely distributed and diverse fauna of bivalve molluscs made known by J. Camargo Mendes and others. Many of these are silicified and very well preserved. The fauna is remarkable in being wholly confined, so far as is known, to the Paraná Basin. A critical review of the bivalves undertaken in the present paper shows that their family affinities are with marine Gondwana forms found in underlying strata (Tubarão Group) and in other Gondwana continents. The remarkable endemicity of the Estrada Nova fauna and carbon isotope paleosalinities suggest intrabasinal evolutionary radiation under conditions of brackish water and extreme isolation. The history of this relict sea compares favorably with the well-documented, extraordinary history of the Pontian Sea of southeastern Europe of late Cenozoic times and is reminiscent of 'sympatric' evolution of the fishes of east African lakes. The taxonomy of 24 generic and 57 specific names employed for the Permian bivalves is revised and their biologic and ecologic significance is analyzed.

N2  - The taxonomy, phylogeny, distribution, ecology, and time and place of origin of all subfamilies, and living and fossil genera of the Rhinotermitidae are discussed and diagrammed. Evolutionary processes and their underlying principles manifest in social populations and interspecies ecosystems are analyzed. Reciprocal phylogeny of termitophilous beetles (Staphylinidae) and intestinal protozoa (Zooflagellata) provide circumstantial evidence for Paleozoic and Mesozoic origins of host-symbiote relations. Fifty-one characters of the ancestral genus of the Rhinotermitidae are postulated, and 64 unidirectional evolutionary trends are listed. Mesozoic faunal exchanges preceding and following continental drift are discussed. The following Tertiary imago species and systematic groups are described, figured, mapped, and compared with their living relatives: the Coptotermitinae, Heterotermitinae, Stylotermitinae; Coptotermes, Heterotermes, Reticulitermes, Stylotermes, Parastylotermes; Coptotermes priscus, new species, Oligocene-Miocene amber, Dominican Republic; C. sucineus, new species Oligocene-Miocene amber, Chiapas, Mexico; Heterotermes primaevus Snyder, Oligocene-Miocene amber, Chiapas, Mexico; Reticulitermes antiquus (Germar), Oligocene Baltic amber; R. minimus Snyder, Oligocene Baltic amber; R. fossarum (Scudder), Oligocene shale, Florissant, Colorado; R. holmgreni (Statz), new combination, Oligocene shale, Rott, Germany; R. creedei Snyder, Oligocene shale, Creede, Colorado; R. laurae Pierce, Miocene nodules, Calico Mountains, California; R. hartungi (Heer), Miocene shale, Switzerland; R. dofleini (Armbruster), new combination, Miocene shale, Randeck, Germany; Parastylotermes robustus (Rosen), Oligocene Baltic amber; P. frazieri Snyder, Miocene nodule, California; P. calico Pierce, Miocene nodule, California; P. washingtonensis (Snyder), Miocene shale, Washington.

N2  - The Powder river local fauna, collected mainly under the direction of H.E. Wood, II, is of earliest Wasatchian age, correlative with the Four Mile and early Gray Bull assemblages. The enclosing Eocene rocks are probably not referable to the Wasatch formation. Forty-one species of mammals are represented in the collection; comparative faunal lists of the Powder River and Four Mile local faunas are presented. A very primitive rodent is present at Powder River, as is a species of true Leptacodon and a probably new small pantolestine. Subspecific divisions are abandoned in the genera Paramys and Hyracotherium, but retained for Phenacolemur. The taxa Adapisoricidae, Phenacodontidae, Apheliscinae, Paeneprolimnocyon, Tetonius, Haplomylus, Hyopsodus miticulus, and Esthonyx spatularius are discussed in some detail.

T1  - Systematics and evolution of Phacops rana (Green, 1832) and Phacops iowensis Delo, 1935 (Trilobita) from the Middle Devonian of North America.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History

VL  - 147
SP  - 47
N2  - Two trilobite species, Phacops rana (Green, 1832) and Phacops iowensis Delo, 1935, from the Middle devonian of North America, are analyzed in detail from the point of view of geographic and stratigraphic variation. A purely morphological, as opposed to biostratigraphic, approach is used in analyzing relationships among subtaxa of the two species. Subsequent comparison of the relative sequence of inferred evolutionary events with documented biostratigraphic distributions allows an analysis of trends (biostratigraphic character gradients), character displacement between the two species, and mode of origin of the subtaxa. The schizochroal eye of these species is the most important anatomical complex in terms of both intrapopulational and interpopulational variation and species discrimination. Lens number per eye may be broken down into number of dorsoventral files (vertical columns of lenses) and number of lenses per dorsoventral file. The adult population number of dorsoventral files per eye in Phacops is reached early in ontogeny and is stabilized; the number of dorsoventral files is the most consistently reliable criterion for discrimination of the two species. Throughout its history, P. iowensis had 13 dorsoventral files in normal adults. This species belongs to a native North American phacopid lineage that can be traced back at least as far as the Gedinnian ('Phacops' logani Hall). Phacops rana, morphologically closest to P. schlotheimi (Bronn) from Europe and elsewhere, has from 15 to 18 dorsoventral files. Most of the history of species involved the reduction from 18 to 15 files; the reduction is an allopatric phenomenon, involving transitional populations acquiring a reduced number of dorsoventral files on the eastern margin of the craton (exogeosyncline), which subsequently invade the cratonal interior. Other evolutionary changes in the P. rana lineage appear to be phyletic trends. The two species are nearly mutually exclusive, though coeval and their geographic ranges overlap considerably. Although P. iowensis occurs from Iowa to New York, it was confined to the Michigan Basin for the larger part of its history. Phacops rana is found from New York south to Virginia and west as far as Iowa. Phacops iowensis was by far the more stable through time; it is invariably rare, and generally confined to purer limestones. The one case of sympatry between rana and iowensis occurs in the Hungry Hollow Formation of Ontario, resulting in morphological changes in the two species which are best explained as character displacement. The P. rana lineage as a whole converged on iowensis in number of dorsoventral files and in many ornamental features; the convergence was closest in the Taghanic. The distribution of, and interactions between, Phacops rana and Phacops iowensis are best explained as if the two taxa are considered true 'bio-species.' Although the little change that occurred within the iowensis lineage seems to have been phyletic in nature, the allopatric model is necessary to account for the more important evolutionary changes in P. rana. Five subspecies of Phacops rana, including P. rana paucituberculata, new subspecies, and three subspecies of P. iowensis, are recognized.

T1  - Comparative myology of jaw, hyoid, and pectoral appendicular regions of New and Old World hystricomorph rodents.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 147
SP  - 117
N2  - The musculature of 13 genera of New World and Old World hystricomorphous rodents was studied by dissection. The genera investigated were Proechimys, Echimys, Isothrix, Mesomys, Myocastor, Octodon, Ctenomys, Erethizon, Cavia, Chinchilla, and Dasyprocta of the New World, and Thryonomys and Petromus of the Old World. The objective of the investigation was to explore the myological characteristics of these rodents as an aid in better understanding their evolutionary history. The hystricognathous mandible that is found in most hystricomorphous rodents is associated with pars reflexa of the superficial masseter muscle. The elongated angular process is associated with the internal pterygoid muscle and with the superficial masseter. The posterior deep part of the lateral masseter muscle lies horizontally, and is associated with the post-condyloid process of these rodents. The temporal muscle is composed mainly of the posterior division. All of these specializations are probably related to the anterior-posterior movement of the jaw. The stylohyoid muscle is missing in all genera investigated (and in bathyergids). The scalenus anterior is present in all genera except Erethizon. The scapuloclavicularis muscle is found in all genera, and is similar in Thryonomys and Dasyprocta. The cutaneus maximus is similar in all genera and unlike the muscle in any other group of rodents. The evidence indicates that New World and Old World hystricomorphs probably represent a common group. This group might have evolved from a hystricognathous paramyid subgroup in the mid-Eocene. Another view is that the group might be a consequence of an invasion of South America by African froms via rafting across the then narrower Atlantic Ocean.

N2  - A systematic revision of the North American family Baenidae has resulted in the following conclusions: 1) The family ranges from Albian, early Cretaceous, to Uintan, late Eocene, in age. 2) Definite members of the family are presently known only from North America. 3) Eight genera including nine species are soundly based on skull material: Trinitichelys hiatti, new genus and new species; Hayemys latifrons (Hay), new genus; Plesiobaena antiqua (Lambe), new genus; Plesiobaena putorius, new genus and new species; Eubaena cephalica (Hay); Stygiochelys estesi Gaffney and Hiatt; Palatobaena bairdi, new genus and new species; Baena arenosa Leidy; and Chisternon undatum (Leidy). Four more genera with one species each are known only from shells: Compsemys victa Leidy; Neurankylus eximius Lambe; Boremys pulchra Lambe; and Thescelus insiliens Hay. The following are nomina dubia: Polythorax missuriensis Cope; 'Neurankylus' wyomingensis Gilmore; 'Baena' hayi Gilmore; 'Baena' nodosa Gilmore; Chisternon interpositum Hay; 'Baena' ornata Gilmore; and 'Baena' platyplastra Gilmore. 4) The family Glyptopsidae has the nearest ancestor in common with the family Baenidae; together they constitute the superfamily Baenoidea. A classification based in part on degree of morphologic diversity but consistent with the phylogeny is developed. A strictly phylogenetic classification is also presented.

T1  - The vertebrate fauna of the Judith River Formation, Montana.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 147
SP  - 323
N2  - Geologic investigation of the late Cretaceous Judith River Formation in the area just north of the Judith River on the Missouri River in north-central Montana has resulted in the discovery of varied vertebrate forms. The beds are mainly freshwater continental deposits consisting of crossbedded channel sandstones, gray siltstones, and carbonaceous shales with occasional seams of lignitic coal. The stratigraphic sequence consists of the Marias River Shale overlain by the Eagle, Claggett, Judith River, and Bearpaw formations. The last four constitute Montana Group. The Judith River Formation is Campanian in age as determined by its position between the fossiliferous marine Claggett and Bearpaw shales. The fauna was obtained from the upper 50 feet of the formation. The bone concentration in the productive sandstone is the result of size sorting leading to underrepresentation of the larger dinosaurs. Three orders of mammals are represented, the Eutheria by a single genus, the Allotheria by five, and the Metatheria by at least three genera. Teiid and parasaniwid lizards are frequent. Only a fraction of the large number of described dinosaur genera, however, is represented in the collection by isolated teeth. Fish and amphibians form a sizable portion of the fauna. Vertebrates from the Judith River Formation are more primitive than, but generally similar to, later Maestrichtian species. The mammals differ from their descendants in the Lance Formation at the species level. The community structure and the paleoecology of the fauna of the Judith River Formation resemble those of the Lance Formation. The greatest difference between the two communities is the greater variety of dinosaurs in the earlier formation.

T1  - Early Pleistocene pre-glacial and glacial rocks and faunas of north-central Nebraska.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 148
SP  - 1
N2  - A study of the early Pleistocene rocks of the non-glaciated region of north-central Nebraska shows that a paleovalley fill (Keim Formation, new name) that contained the Sand Draw local fauna was preglacial. The stratigraphic position of the overlying Long Pine Formation, new name, is significant because it is the first evidence of a fluvioglacial outwash in the area. Two later sets of deposits overlie the Long Pine formation: Duffy and Pettijohn formations, new names. The source of the gravel in the Long Pine Formation has been a matter of conjecture, some geologists believing it to be the Black Hills, and others the Rocky Mountains. Supporting evidence for either provenience is lacking. Devonian fossils in the Long Pine Gravel indicate that the source was to the north-northeast near Lake Winnepegosis in Manitoba. The Sand Draw local fauna, previously considered Nebraskan (first continental glacier) or Aftonian (first interstadial), correlates with other Blancan faunas, and is the most diverse and northern known of Blancan time. The following groups comprise the fauna: 42 taxa of molluscs, 14 taxa of ostracodes, 10 taxa of fishes (Chaenobryttus serratus, new species), four taxa of amphibians, 14 taxa of reptiles (Geochelone oelrichi, new species), at least 10 taxa of birds, and 35 taxa of mammals. The mammalian fauna has these new forms: a shrew, Planisorex dixonensis, new genus; four rodents, Spermophilus boothi, new species; Spermophilus meltoni, new species; Ophiomys magilli, new species; Ophiomys fricki, new species; and a mustelid, Buisnictis burrowsi, new species. Some of these fossils indicate that the early Pleistocene climate was warmer than the present one, sub-humid, with evapo-transpiration about equal to average annual precipitation. Presence of the large land tortoise, Geochelone, is evidence that the temperature seldom, if ever, dropped below 0°C. Pollen from the Keim Formation is definaitely not of glacial type.

N2  - Study of published records and about 6500 specimens of native mammals of the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, revealed 122 species; at least 17 other species probably occur in the state. The number of species in any one area, however, is only about 35 to 55. Illustrated keys are based on external and cranial characters and also include 10 domestic and introduced species. The taxonomic status within Chihuahua of each species and subspecies is considered, including intrasubspecific variation when observed. A synonymy of names used for Chihuahuan specimens of each taxon is given. Specimens examined are listed and localities are mapped. Analysis indicates three major faunas in the tropical coastal plain, the wooded sierra, and the grassy to desert plateau. These faunas are correlated with geography, topography, climate, and vegetation.

T1  - A revision of the frogs of the subfamily Asterophryinae, family Microhylidae.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 148
SP  - 413
N2  - Asterophryine frogs are confined in distribution to the New Guinea region, from the Louisiade Archipelago on the east, westward through New Guinea proper to the Moluccas Islands. Members of this subfamily are not known to have reached Australia or the Bismarck Archipelago. The subfamily Asterophryinae is characterized by the diplasiocoelous condition of the vertebral column, upper and lower jaws symphygnathine in most genera, and the tongue broadly attached (less than one-quarter free behind). The closest relationship is with the Sphenophryninae, also limited largely to the New Guinea region, whose members are procoelous, eleutherognathine, and have the tongue more than one-quarter free behind. The last major reviser of the Microhylidae included five genera and 24 species in the Asterophryinae. In the present work seven genera (one new) are defined, largely on the basis of features of the osteology of the skull, and 37 species (10 new) are recognized. Apparently all asterophryine (and all sphenophrynine) frogs have direct embryonic development, omitting a free-living tadpole stage. All species for which information is available inhabit the floor of the rain forest, although structural features of some little-known forms suggest arboreal tendencies. None is known to be even partly aquatic. Various species are found at elevations from sea level to over 11,000 feet (3350 m.). The distribution of all species is shown on spot maps, and most species are illustrated. Keys to the genera and species are provided. Audiospectrograms illustrate the mating calls of five species. The chromosome number (n=13) is known for only one species of one genus.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 8
SP  - 3
N2  - One of the richest Permian gastropod faunas of Asia was found during intensive field work conducted by the Geological Survey of Malaysia. Discovered in the H.S. Lee Mine no. 8 near Kampar, Perak, it rivals any known Permian fauna with the exception of the Permian of west Texas. Twenty-eight species of bellerophontids and pleurotomarians are herein described, including one new genus, Ambozone, one new subgenus, Glabrocingulam (Stenozone), and 11 new species. The dominant pleurotomarian family is the Eotomariidae which is also the most diverse group in other Permian faunas. The fauna resembles those described from other regions of Southeast Asia, but includes genera hitherto known only from the Sosio beds of Sicily and the Permian of west Texas. The Malaysian fauna is important because it gives a much more complete picture of the Tethyan gastropods of eastern Asia and because of important new species which greatly enlarges our understanding of Upper Paleozoic gastropod phylogeny. The fauna also aids in demonstrating the existence of marine seaways from Sosio, Sicily eastward to Texas and possibly South America.

T1  - The origin of the bird fauna of the south Venezuelan highlands.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 136
SP  - 273
N2  - The isolated tabletop mountains in southern Venezuela (including Roraima and Duida), the adjacent border of Brazil, and Guyana are the home of an interesting highland avifauna rich in endemics. We have designated the area as Pantepui. 2. The history of the ornithological exploration of these mountains, beginning in 1842 with the work of the Schomburgks, is presented. Birds have been collected on a total of 26 cerros and tepuis. Of the approximately 10,750 specimens taken, 8340 are in the Phelps Collection in Caracas. 3. Ninety-six species can be considered typical subtropical elements. Twenty-nine of these are endemic species or superspecies. 4. The subtropical elements are found on the summits and in the cool humid forests of the talus slopes. 5. About two-thirds of the characteristic elements are widely distributed in the Pantepui area. Five species have not yet been found east of the Río Caroní; 18 species are found only to the east of it. 6. Many (viz., 42) species are represented on Pantepui by several subspecies, six in the case of Atlapetes personatus, five or four in several other species. Nine of the 29 endemic species are monotypic. Two species have evolved into superspecies. 7. The 96 Pantepui elements represent every stage of endemicity, from endemic genera (two or three weakly characterized ones) and species (29), to non-endemic species with endemic subspecies (55), and non-endemic species without endemic subspecies (12). 8. The 96 Pantepui species can be assigned to four kinds of faunal elements: (a) specialized cliff dwellers (five species), (b) altitudinal derivatives of elements that are tropical in other areas (34), (c) long-distance colonists which reached Pantepui by 'hopping' across the unsuitable lowlands (48), and (d) old endemics which may have originated as either (b) or (c) (nine). 9. Many species exhibit strong geographic variation in habitat preference. Basically subtropical species may have tropical populations and vice versa. Such plasticity unquestionably facilitates the crossing of ecological barriers, such as lowlands present for mountain birds. 10. Among the 48 species of long-distance colonists 24 species presumably came from the Andes; 19 species, from the coastal cordilleras of northern Venezuela; and five species, from more distant areas. 11. The small number of old endemics indicates a rapid replacement in the bird fauna of these mountains, which must have existed for some 30 million years. 12. Although a few of the Pantepui endemics can be called relicts, they are not remnants of a formerly more widespread fauna, which is now extinct elsewhere. Most endemics belong to the most actively speciating genera and families of South American birds.

T1  - Comparative histological studies on Duvernoy's gland of colubrid snakes.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 138
SP  - 1
N2  - The salivary glands of about 180 species, representing some 120 genera, of snakes were examined histologically, those of 71 genera for the first time. The supralabial and glands of Duvernoy are described, and the intraspecific variation within these glands is summarized on the basis of a computer analysis. The patterns of the similarity matrices were compared with the phylogenetic schemes proposed by various authors for the Colubridae. The conclusions reached are as follows. There is a trend toward the reduction of cell height with the development of a large Duvernoy's gland. Duvernoy's glands in the Natricinae seem to be characterized by mucous cells. The Xenoderminae have a unique arrangement of the supralabial glands, with an alternation of serous- and mucous-cell cords along the supralabial ridge. Duvernoy's glands in the Homolopsinae form a gradually enlarging series, with the largest glands found in Enhydris. The variation of the histological pattern in the Duvernoy's glands of the Colubridae clearly opposes the view that the Boiginae (Dipsadomorphinae of authors) are a natural group. The variation of pattern within the Colubrinae and the Boiginae is so great and the overlap so complete that no difference can be seen in the labial glands of the Colubridae that would support the separation of the Boiginae from the Colubridae in respect to this character. The gland in Dispholidus typus is different from the other colubrid glands examined and can be readily differentiated from all other glands.

T1  - Seasonal and diurnal occurrences of fish sounds in a small Florida bay.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 138
SP  - 327
N2  - Studies on fish-produced sounds were made around the clock and through the seasons in a small Florida bay. 2. The dominant sounds were produced by Galeichthys felis and Opsanus beta, and an as yet unidentified species. Less frequently occurring unidentified sounds of considerable variety seemed to be made by transients or strays. 3. Galeichthys produced its 'percolator choruses' from April through October, with a summer lull in July and August, never earlier than 5:00 P.M. and never continued later than 10:50 P.M., with a duration ranging from nine minutes to four hours. 4. There was a distinct tendency for Galeichthys to be more sonic during the period near the new moon, a feature less noticeable in Opsanus. 5. Choruses of Galeichthys formed only when the water temperature ranged between 74 F. and 89 F. and began only after the light intensity fell to values of from 1 to 1900 foot-candles. 6. Opsanus produced its 'boat-whistle' sound from March to October, with a summer lull from May through July, most vigorous about the time Galeichthys choruses were full, but heard irregularly at all times of day and night. 7. The frequency of the 'boat-whistle' of Opsanus varied with water temperature, ranging from about 0.93 sound per minute at 74 F. to about 1.92 sounds per minute at 83 F., with none below 73 F. or above 91 F. 8. The third, but unidentified, sound-producer made its peculiar repetitional soft tapping sound from October to June, with a lull from January through March. 9. This third sound occurred in a temperature range of from 64 F. to 83 F. and with light intensities ranging from zero to 150 foot-candles; no clear relationship to moon phases could be established. 10. An appendix describes the apparatus used and in some cases developed.

T1  - Asiatic Mesonychidae (Mammalia, Condylarthra).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 132
SP  - 129
N2  - The subfamily Mesonychinae is rediagnosed. Two new genera and species are described: Mongolonyx dolichognathus from the 'Irdin Manha' beds and Mongolestes hadrodens from the 'Ulan Gochu' Formation of Inner Mongolia. Harpagolestes was probably represented in Asia. ?Harpagolestes orientalis, new species, is described, and the published literature and most of the known specimens of this probably holarctic genus are re-evaluated. This is not, however, a substitute for a systematic revision of Harpagolestes. 'Mesonyx obtusidens,' reported by Gromova (1952), from the Naran Bulak beds of Mongolia, is a species of Pachyaena. Olsenia, a mesonychid described by Matthew and Granger (1925a) based solely on astragali, is not comparable to most of the known genera because of the scarcity of associations between mesonychid teeth and foot bones. The name 'Olsenia' is suggested to be a nomen dubium. A new subfamily, the Hapalodectinae, is erected and is based on Hapalodectes. 'Hapalodectes auctus,' described by Matthew and Granger (1925b), is not a mesonychid but a didymaconid. A new subfamily, the Andrewsarchinae, is diagnosed and is based on Andrewsarchus. Several unallocated Asiatic mesonychids are described. Studying the feeding mechanism of mesonychids led to a re-examination of the previous ideas of Boule, Matthew, and others, who maintained that the Mesonychidae had a very weak jaw musculature and that therefore these mammals could not fill a carnivore or scavenger niche. On the basis of the present studies, it seems very probable that mesonychids had a powerful mandibular musculature. The variation of the length/width ratio of homologous lower check teeth of various species of mesonychids might serve as an index to feeding habit. A relatively long lower cheek tooth suggests a carnivorous habit, while a relatively transverse, blunt lower tooth may indicate an omnivorous or scavenging habit. The Mesonychoidea, in agreement with the action of Van Valen (1966), are transferred from the Carnivora to the Condylarthra. No sound phylogenetic conclusions can be offered for the evolution within the Mesonychidae. The known diversity of mesonychids in the late Eocene and early Oligocene of Asia, and our ignorance of the Asiatic Paleocene and early and middle Eocene faunas would badly mar any proposed phylogeny. As a heuristic alternative, the arrangement of the known mesonychid genera to form several adaptive levels may partially clarify mesonychid diversity. In this paper the following five adaptive levels are suggested without implying any phyletic relationship between the various levels: carnivore level, advanced carnivore level, omnivore-carnivore level, omnivore level, bone-crushing level. This study of Asiatic mesonychids revealed a previously unsuspected diversity of genera among the Asiatic forms in comparison to European and North American taxa. The presence of at least 10 genera is ascertained from the poorly known Asiatic strata in comparison to the seven known genera of mesonychids from the relatively well-known early Tertiary of North America and Europe. For a summary of the known worldwide temporal and geographic distribution of the Mesonychidae, see tables 10 and 11.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 129
SP  - 309
N2  - Information is presented concerning the relationships, ecology, and behavior of North American flickers, Colaptes auratus, including the subspecies groups auratus, cafer, chrysoïdes, chrysocaulosus, and mexicanoïdes. 2. The situation of hybridization between the auratus and cafer groups of Colaptes auratus is analyzed, with the use of color and mensural characters. The hybrid zone, including the area in which 95 per cent or more of the flickers are hybrids, is a broad band of variable width extending from British Columbia eastward to Alberta and southward and eastward from there to Texas. 3. Evidence is presented for the occurrence of introgression in populations of auratus and cafer. Diminishing effects of hybridization are detectable in populations of auratus to the Atlantic Ocean, and cafer to the Pacific Ocean and Mexico. 4. Color characters used in the study were found to be somewhat correlated in hybrids but not to an extent invalidating their use as separate characters. No evidence for assortative mating was found in a study of the mating patterns of a limited number of hybrid pairs. 5. Localized hybridization occurs between the cafer and chrysoïdes groups. Considerable introgression has occurred, although the hybrids are found largely in hybrid swarms, more or less geographically isolated from parental populations. Some hybrid swarms have undergone partial stabilization. Evidence is offered that indicates that genes from eastern auratus populations, introgressing into the western cafer populations, are able to enter the chrysoïdes population as a result of the hybridization between cafer and chrysoïdes. 6. An attempt is made to trace the history of the hybrid situations in North American flickers. The hypothesis is developed that chrysoïdes originated in Baja California as an isolated cafer population. Hybridization between auratus and cafer has apparently occurred over a long period. Hybridization between cafer and chrysoïdes is thought to be of more recent occurrence. 7. Introgression was probably of major importance for the survival of some animal species in the Pleistocene and is probably a factor in their present success under conditions of constant human modification of the environment. 8. Selection, isolating mechanisms, and reinforcement are discussed in terms of the advantages of gene exchange between populations. Criteria are discussed for determination of the taxonomic status of hybridizing populations, including (a) hybridization along a broad area of contact between populations with strongly developed and those with poorly developed, or nondeveloped, isolating mechanisms; (b) hybridization along narrow contacts, involving populations exhibiting strongly and weakly developed isolating mechanisms; and (c) both ordinary and stabilized hybrid swarms, geographically isolated from their parental populations. 9. The North American flickers are considered to be conspecific. Five subspecies groups of the species Colaptes auratus are recognized. These are auratus, cafer, chrysoïdes, mexicanoïdes, and chrysocaulosus.

T1  - Deltatheridia, a new order of mammals.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 132
SP  - 1
N2  - A reconsideration of the phylogeny of some early placental mammals, especially the creodonts, has resulted in the removal of all creodonts except the Miacidae from the Carnivora. The Arctocyonidae and their descendants, the Mesonychidae, are placed in the Condylarthra, and a new order, the Deltatheridia, is created for the Oxyaenoidea, the Palaeoryctidae, the Didymoconidae, and Micropternodus. The zalambdodont insectivores may or may not also be referable to the Deltatheridia. A survey of taxonomically significant characters indicates that the Miacidae are apparently closer to the Arctocyonidae than to the Pantolestinae or to the Deltatheridia. The whales were probably derived from mesonychids in the Paleocene. A detailed consideration of the morphology, systematics, and evolution of the Didelphodontinae is presented, and observations are made on many other mammalian genera, mainly, but not exclusively, of the Deltatheridia. Greatest emphasis is placed on the evolution of dental structure and occlusion, and cranial circulation. A detailed terminology is proposed for the structures of primitive therian teeth. Teeth of possible Tiffanian and Puercan oxyaenoid ancestors are described. Apterodon is tentatively referred to the Mesonychidae; Micropternodus, Nyssodon, and Sarcodon are referred to the Palaeoryctidae; Kochictis and Kopidodon, to the Mioclaeninae; Argillotherium is referred to the Oxyaeninae; and Praolestes, Opisthopsalis, Hyracolestes, and Xenacodon are referred to the Erinaceoidea. New genera are Avunculus in the Didelphodontinae, Pararyctes in the Palaeoryctinae, Mongoloryctes in the Didymoconidae, and Epapheliscus in the Apheliscinae. A new species of Palaeoryctes is described from the late Paleocene, one of Oxyaena, from the early Eocene; and one of Oxyaenodon, from the late Eocene. A possible case of geographic speciation in Didelphodus is presented, and comments are made on determining the relative adaptiveness of different characters, conditions of competitive exclusion, criteria of taxonomic definitions, and other theoretical matters.

T1  - Teiid lizards of the genus Neusticurus (Reptilia, Sauria).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 132
SP  - 279
N2  - Examination of 310 specimens, including type material of eight of the 12 previously proposed names, indicates that lizards of the genus can conveniently be separated into seven species and eight forms. On the basis of characters of the hemipenis, the seven species form two quite distinct groups. Neusticurus bicarinatus, N. tatei, and N. rudis have few flounces (eight to 12), no calcareous spinules in the flounces, a reduced dorsal welt in the inverted organ, and zigzag flounces in the inverted organ. Neusticurus ecpleopus, N. strangulatus, N. cochranae, and N. apodemus have more flounces (11-20), numerous calcareous spinules in the flounces, the free ends in the edge of the flounce, a well-developed dorsal welt in the inverted organ, and chevron-shaped flounces. These two groups have discrete ranges: Neusticurus tatei is known only from the Guayanan uplands; N. rudis occurs there and in the lowlands of the Guianas. Neusticurus bicarinatus occurs in these areas and widely throughout the Amazon Valley. On the other hand, N. cochranae is known only from the eastern Andean slopes of Ecuador. Neusticurus strangulatus occurs on the eastern Andean slopes from Ecuador to central Peru. Neusticurus ecpleopus is widely distributed on the eastern Andean slopes from central Bolivia to southern Colombia. Neusticurus apodemus is isolated in southwestern Costa Rica. Additional characters unite the species in these two groups. Neusticurus bicarinatus, N. tatei, and N. rudis have more (24-32) transverse rows of ventral scales; usually the canthus rostralis is angular. Neusticurus ecpleopus, N. apodemus, N. strangulatus, and N. cochranae have fewer (19-26) transverse rows of ventral scales; usually the canthus rostralis is more rounded. Neusticurus ecpleopus, N. apodemus, N. strangulatus, and N. cochranae have poorly to well-developed, black-bordered, white-centered ocelli; ocelli do not occur in N. bicarinatus, N. rudis, or N. tatei. Neusticurus bicarinatus and N. tatei share a recessed tympanum, strongly compressed tails, and complex hemipenial flounces; they appear to be closely related. Neusticurus ecpleopus and N. apodemus have longitudinal rows of tubercles on the upper sides of the neck and tubercles on the sides of the body and posterior end of the head. They are closely related. Lizards of the genus Neusticurus apparently lay two eggs per clutch. Nineteen of 20 females with oviducal eggs contained one egg in each oviduct; the single exception had an egg in one oviduct only. Observations are not available for N. apodemus. Many species of Neusticurus are diurnal and semiaquatic. Observations are available for N. ecpleopus, N. rudis, N. tatei. Neusticurus apodemus is semiaquatic and partly nocturnal. The very short tail of N. cochranae suggests that it is not aquatic; it may be partly nocturnal. The strongly compressed tail of N. bicarinatus suggests that it is semiaquatic; it is probably diurnal. The habits of N. strangulatus are not known, but the well developed ocelli of some specimens suggest that it may be diurnal. Within Group II of the family Teiidae, Neusticurus appears to be most closely related to Echinosura. The present distribution of the forms of these two genera suggests an early division into Echinosaura in the Caribbean and Pacific lowlands of northwestern South America, and two groups of Neusticurus, one on the eastern Andean slopes and another in the Guayana highlands area. It seems likely that the respective adaptations of these two groups serve to prevent extensive contact between them. The widespread Guayanan species N. bicarinatus seems well adapted to the Amazon lowlands. This specialization probably keeps it from moving far into the Andean region. The most widespread Andean species (N. ecpleopus) does not occur far into the Amazon lowlands. It seems to lack special adaptations for this habitat. The lack of morphological intermediates between these two groups suggests that they have been long isolated. Neusticurus ecpleopus and N. apodemus are closely related. The present range of N. apodemus represents a past transgression of the Andes by N. ecpleopus or its immediate ancestor. The partly nocturnal habits of N. apodemus and the partly nocturnal and more terrestrial habits of Echinosaura horrida may reflect competition of both with iguanid lizards of the genus Basiliscus, which occur in Pacific and Caribbean Central America and South America, and which are semiaquatic. Systematic changes include transfer of Arthrosaura tatei to Neusticurus; N. racenisi is considered a synonym of N. tatei. Neusticurus dejongi and N. surinamensis are both considered synonyms of N. rudis. Neusticurus ocellatus and N. tuberculatus are both considered synonyms of N. ecpleopus. Neusticurus rudis, N. tatei, and N. ecpleopus all vary geographically, but subspecies are not recognized nomenclatorially. Neusticurus apodemus, an isolated species from Costa Rica, is described; it is closely related to N. ecpleopus. Neusticurus cochranae is recognized as a species different from N. ecpleopus. Euspondylus testae is considered a synonym of Neusticurus strangulatus; a subspecies with tubercles from central Peru (N. s. trachodus) is described.

T1  - Hybridization in meadowlarks.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 134
SP  - 1
N2  - Previous studies of the comparative biology of the eastern meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and the western meadowlark (S. neglecta) have revealed that these sibling species are virtually, if not completely, isolated throughout a rather narrow zone of sympatry from central Mexico to the Great Lakes region of the United States. A case of hybridization of the two species in New York is fully substantiated by the capture of both adults and their hybrid offspring, and by the subsequent analysis of the morphology and vocalizations of the captive birds. Another hybrid, from Quebec, was also raised in captivity and is included in this analysis. A total of six hybrids are reported on here, all of which represent the first generation of hybrids produced by crossings in the wild of neglecta males with nominate magna females. No data are currently available on the reciprocal cross or on populations of magna other than the nominate race. Attempts to breed and to hybridize these captive individuals have failed. Morphologically, the first generation of hybrids of this particular cross are phenotypically indistinguishable from the magna parent with respect to those characters that depend on the intensity of melanic and carotenoid pigmentation, but are intermediate between the parental types with respect to the sexually dimorphic characters, including cheek color and mensural characteristics. Mensural characters are useless as indices of hybridization except for the elimination of 'extreme' specimens. All hybrid males from this cross should be identifiable by the concordance of a prominent yellow area on the cheek with an overall dark plumage coloration. The same characters must be used for females, but with considerably less confidence. The size of the repertoire of primary song patterns shows some promise as a clue for the field identification of hybrid males, but the actual patterns of primary song are meaningless for this purpose. Conflicting evidence on the call notes of hybrids necessitates further experimentation in this area and, at present, precludes their use for the identification of hybrids in the field. The results of this study make it clear that hybrid meadowlarks can be identified with accuracy and authority only on the basis of a prior knowledge of the phenotypic recombinations of specific characters in hybrids of known parentage.

T1  - Mixodectidae, Microsyopidae, and the insectivore-primate transition.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 140
SP  - 195
N2  - Contrary to the practice of many earlier workers, the author of the present paper clearly separates the Paleocene Mixodectidae and the Eocene Microsyopidae. The following species and genera of the insectivore mixodectids are considered valid: Mixodectes pungens, Mixodectes malaris, Elpidophorus elegans, Elpidophorus minor, Eudaemonema cuspidata, Dracontolestes aphantus, and Remiculus deutschi. Various Puercan fossils other than Dracontolestes probably have been incorrectly allocated to the family. The cranial and postcranial anatomy of mixodectids is virtually unknown. An undoubted derivation of mixodectids from any of the known Cretaceous or Paleocene families is not possible. Mixodectids may have originated from some unknown Cretaceous palaeoryctids, erinaceoids, or near-erinaceoid group. Leptictid ancestry for the family is not likely, because even the earliest leptictids are shown to be more advanced than mixodectids in certain important features of the molar teeth. Close ties of mixodectids with Adapisoriculus and Recent tupaiids are not improbable. The possibility of a close plagiomenid-mixodectid affinity is re-examined, and some new evidence is described and illustrated. There is no direct or meaningful indirect evidence to confirm a derivation of plagiomenids from the Mixodectidae. Allocation of the Mixodectoidea to the Dermoptera is considered to be unjustified. Thylacaelurus is not a plagiomenid. Its affinities may lie with insectivores close to the dimylid stem. The Eocene Microsyopidae are known from the following species and genera: Microsyops wilsoni, new species, M. alfi, M. angustidens, M. latidens, M. scottianus, M. lundeliusi, M. elegans, M. annectens, M. kratos, and Craseops sylvestris. Microsyopid cranial anatomy is described in detail; the postcranial anatomy is virtually unknown. From the evidence of the dental morphology, the microsyopids may be derivable from the earliest primates. Because it is not known whether Cretaceous and early and middle Paleocene primates had the relatively advanced basicrania of late Paleocene Plesiadapis and Eocene prosimians, the primitive basicranium of Microsyops is not necessarily decisive against the inclusion of microsyopids in the Primates. As opposed to the usual practice of overburdening the Insectivora and using it as a 'wastebasket,' the microsyopids are placed, although with a query, in the Primates. The late Paleocene Navajovius is allocated, with a query, to the Microsyopidae. Navajovius? mckennai, new species, from the Wasatchian Almagre facies of the San José Formation is poorly known. The insectivore-primate transition was probably initiated at the end of the Cretaceous or earlier by behavioral and physiological adaptations. As behavioral modifications (particularly preference for fruits, leaves, and similar foods as opposed to a predominantly insectivorous diet) affected the feeding habits and behavior, selection gradually altered the morphology and function of the feeding mechanism. The primitive therian and eutherian molar shear was gradually de-emphasized by a reduction of the long paracrista and metacrista, a straightening out of the centrocrista, and the acquisition of more bulbous and less acute cusps and conules. As prevallid-postvallum and postvallid-prevallum shear lost relative importance, the trigonid became narrower and less tall, and the talonid gained functional importance. The teeth, with other parts of the feeding mechanism, became more suitable for mastication and other aspects of oral digestion of a predominantly frugivorous-herbaceous diet. The apatemyids and tupaiids are considered to be independently derived families from the Insectivora, not the Primates. The Paleocene picrodontids, extremely specialized frugivores derived from early primates, epitomize (with other prosimians) the nature and direction of selection pressures responsible for the origin of the Primates.

T1  - A review of the water snakes of the genus Natrix in Mexico.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 142
SP  - 1
N2  - This study is concerned primarily with geographical distribution and variation among the three species of water snakes of the genus Natrix in Mexico, but considerable information on ecology and natural history is also included. Among the three species, Natrix valida occurs in western Mexico, but Natrix erythrogaster and Natrix rhombifera not only inhabit eastern Mexico but also range widely in the United States. In the arid northern portions of Mexico these snakes are confined to the rivers and occasional springs and swamps, and the populations occupying individual drainage systems were formerly completely isolated from those of other systems. Theoretically it is now possible in a few areas, however, for semiaquatic snakes, such as Natrix, to move from one river system to another by following the canals of recently developed irrigation projects. Isolation has been of sufficiently long duration to permit the evolution of two distinct subspecies of Natrix erythrogaster, one each in the Río Nazas and Río Aguanaval. A third race of erythrogaster occurs in northeastern Mexico. Natrix rhombifera, which also has three subspecies in Mexico, ranges widely through the lowlands of eastern Mexico. One race occurs in the northeastern states, a second has its center of abundance in the vast and complex drainage system that discharges into the Gulf of Mexico through the Río Pánuco at Tampico, and the third is widespread through the swamplands of southern Veracruz and Tabasco. The distribution of the collecting localities, when plotted on a map of the drainage systems, indicates that stream piracy probably has occurred in Nuevo León and that the Río San Juan has decapitated the headwaters of the Río San Lorenzo of the Río Conchos-San Fernando system, with consequent transfer of the aquatic and semiaquatic faunas to the drainage of the Rio Grande. The break between the two southern races of rhombifera occurs in the region where the Sierra Chiconquiaco and associated highlands extend eastward to the Gulf of Mexico, south of Nautla, Veracruz, and effectively separate the Gulf coastal plain into northern and southern sectors. On the west coast there is a similar, but less massive disruption of the coastal plain immediately south of San Blas, Nayarit. Three races of Natrix come together in this area. One occurs northward as far as the Río Yaqui in Sonora; a second ranges southward along the tenuous and frequently interrupted coastal plain at least to the vicinity of Acapulco, Guerrero; and the third occupies an outlier of the Mexican altiplano in the vicinity of Tepic, Nayarit. A fourth race of valida is confined to the Cape Region of Baja California. The present distribution of the genus Natrix in Mexico suggests that these reptiles were much more widely distributed during one or more pluvial periods of late Pleistocene or Recent time and that increasing aridity in western North America has resulted in the fragmentation of their ranges and the establishment of numerous isolated populations, especially in rivers in the northern part of Mexico. Earlier pluvial periods may also have permitted Natrix valida to range northward around the head of the Gulf of California and from there southward through Baja California, which would explain the presence of the isolated subspecies that has survived in the Cape Region. The various taxa are discussed in detail in the present paper, with emphasis on variation in scutellation and color patterns. Distributions are plotted on a series of six maps. Ten plates, two in color, illustrate all the various subspecies from life; 12 additional plates illustrate habitats in which these reptiles have been collected. Field work in Mexico was conducted in each of 10 different years, and the total accumulated time, including work on parallel studies on garter snakes of the genus Thamnophis, amounted to almost exactly a full year. During these investigations every state and territory in Mexico was visited at least once, as well as the Federal District.

T1  - Function of forebrain and cerebellum in learning in the teleost Tilapia heudelotii macrocephala.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 142
SP  - 143
N2  - The function of the forebrain and the cerebellum in learning in the teleost fish Tilapia heudelotii macrocephala was studied. An avoidance conditioning paradigm with light or sound as the CS and shock as the US was used. The design of the four experiments performed was: Experiment I -- operations performed prior to training; forebrain ablated in experimental subjects; sham operations performed or olfactory bulbs ablated in controls; CS was light. Experiment II -- operations performed prior to training; forebrain ablated in experimental subjects; sham operations performed on controls; CS was sound. Experiment III -- operations performed after training; subjects first underwent sham operation and then olfactory bulb ablation, or only the latter; following a period of retesting, both lobes of the forebrain were ablated; CS was sound. Experiment IV, a and b -- operations performed prior to training; body of the cerebellum ablated in experimental subjects; sham operations performed on controls; CS was light. All subjects were trained to avoid or escape from intermittent shock by swimming through a hole in a partition that divided the test tank into two equal compartments. Intact, sham, and olfactory bulb-ablated controls quickly learned to avoid the shock, and performance was stabilized soon after, with a high percentage of avoidance responses and consistently low latencies. These were achieved by the efficient intertrial behavior of the subjects, as well as by their speed and accuracy. When the forebrain was ablated prior to training, subjects took much longer to acquire the avoidance response. Even after long periods of testing, performance remained unstable, with variable latencies and fewer avoidance responses than those of the controls. When the operations were performed after training, it was found that sham operation had no effect on performance, whereas ablation of the olfactory bulbs had only a slight, transitory effect on the performance of some subjects. Ablation of the forebrain, however, resulted in marked and long-lasting deficits. Immediately after operation, avoidances dropped to a low level with a concurrent increase in the number of trials in which subjects neither avoided nor escaped. With continued testing, the performance of some subjects of Experiments I to III improved, but none reached the consistently high levels of avoidance responses and low latencies characteristic of the performance of the controls. On the other hand the performance of a few animals deteriorated in an erratic manner. Ablation of the body of the cerebellum had, at most, only a very transitory effect on equilibrium. It did, however, result in more severe deficits in the acquisition of a conditioned avoidance response than did ablation of the forebrain. Some cerebellum-ablated subjects never avoided at all, but those that did, performed at a very low level. Even escape performance was below that of a typical forebrain operate with higher latencies and fewer responses. Unlike the forebrain operates, cerebellum-ablated subjects showed no improvement with continued testing. Results are interpreted as being consistent with our hypothesis that the forebrain acts as a facilitator of behavior which is organized in other brain centers. The subsequent improvement noted in the performance of many forebrain-ablated subjects is regarded as an indication that a compensatory process is taking place in some other part of the brain. The body of the cerebellum appears to play a more essential role in the acquisition of a conditioned avoidance response and may, in fact, be directly concerned with learning processes.

T1  - Osteology and evolutionary relationships of the Sternoptychidae, with a new classification of stomiatoid families.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 153
SP  - 329
N2  - New primarily osteological evidence was collected for a reinterpretation of the phylogenetic interrelationships of the teleost fish suborder Stomiatoidei, especially the nominal families Sternoptychidae and Gonostomatidae. Basic differences were found dividing the suborder into two sister groups (proposed as new infraorders), the Gonostomata and the Photichthya. Evidence indicates that the Gonostomata consists of two sister-group families, the Gonostomatidae with six of the 20 genera formerly assigned to this family and the Sternoptychidae including seven genera formerly considered as maurolicin gonostomatids and the three hatchetfish genera, which previously constituted the Sternoptychidae. A hypothesis concerning the phylogenetic interrelationships of the 10 sternoptychid genera is proposed. The genera Thorophos and Araiophos are closely related and proposed as a sister group of the remaining eight genera. The relationships of Maurolicus are unclear, but apparently it forms a sister group of the remaining seven genera. Danaphos and Valenciennellus are closely related and form a sister group of the remaining five genera. Argyripnus and Sonoda form a sister group of the three hatchetfish genera, Polyipnus, Argyropelecus, and Sternoptyx. Argyropelecus and Sternoptyx form a sister group of Polyipnus. Of all the genera, Thorophos is the most primitive, Sternoptyx the most advanced. Evidence was also found demonstrating that the Photichthya consists of two sister groups (proposed as new superfamilies), the Photichthyoidea and the Stomiatoidea. The Photichthyoidea contains one family, the Photichthyidae, including seven of the genera formerly ascribed to the Gonostomatidae. The Stomiatoidea were not investigated in detail at the family or generic level, but it was found that the interrelationships, validity, and contents of the currently accepted families are questionable.

N2  - The present paper is a revision of the subgenera Neocychrus, Stenocantharus, Pseudonomaretus, and Nomaretus of the genus Scaphinotus, and of the American species of the genus Cychrus. The following nomenclatural changes are made: Scaphinotus (Stenocantharus) angusticollis Mannerheim (1824), Scaphinotus (Stenocantharus) velutinus Ménétriés (1844), Scaphinotus (Pseudonomaretus) relictus Horn (1881), and Scaphinotus (Pseudonomaretus) regularis LeConte 91884) are considered to be valid species. Scaphinotus (Pemphus) longipes Casey (1897) is reduced to a junior synonym of Scaphinotus (Stenocantharus) velutinus Ménétriés (1844). The genitalia of both males and females of each species were studied. Some new localities have been added, and maps of distribution, keys, and illustrations are presented.

VL  - 154
SP  - 1
N2  - The North American representatives of the tribe Amauropsini belong to a single known genus, Arianops Brendel, of which 31 species are recognized, arranged in seven species groups. Twenty-two species occur in the southeastern Appalachians, but other species are nown from central Pennsylvania (1), central Tennessee (3), north Alabama (4), and northwest Arkansas (1). Twenty-six species are edaphobitic, and five species, known only from caves, are probably troglobitic. The amplyoponica group includes amplyoponica (Brendel and Wickham), Pennsylvania; plectrops Casey, North Carolina; nodosa, new species, North Carolina; laminata, new species, North Carolina; spinicollis, new species, North Carolina; and sandersoni, new species, Arkansas. The alticola group includes two species from North Carolina, alticola, new species, and barbata, new species. The nantahalae group includes nantahalae nantahalae, new species and subspecies, North Carolina; nantahalae joanna, new subspecies, North Carolina; unicoi, new species, North Carolina and Tennessee; and digitata, new species, Tennessee. The neglects group includes neglecta, new species, North Carolina and Georgia; coweeta, new species, North Carolina; parki, North Carolina; truncata, Georgia; and allatoona, Georgia. The cavernensis group includes cavernensis Park, Alabama; jeanneli park, Virginia; stygica Park, Tennessee; pecki, new species, Tennessee; steevesi, new species, Alabama; extera, new species, Alabama; sewanee, new species, Tennessee; and kingi, new species, Alabama. The group is equivalent to subgenus Arispeleops Park, here considered a junior synonym of Arianops. The gigantea group is monobasic, established for gigantea, new species, North Carolina. The henroti group includes six small, flattened species from northeast Georgia and southwest North Carolina: henroti Park, Georgia; thornei, new species, North Carolina; norithe, new species, North Carolina; fovealis, new species, North Carolina; teyahalee, new species, North Carolina; and obliqua, new species, Georgia. A key to species, illustrations, and distribution maps are provided.

T1  - Lower Leonardian Brachiopoda of the Sierra Diablo.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 105
SP  - 261
N2  - The Sierra Diablo Mountains of western Texas contain an excellent section of Permian rocks ranging in age from Wolfcampian to Guadalupian, which in conjunction with the Permian sequence in the near-by Guadalupe Mountains form the standard section of the North American Permian. Outcrops of Leonardian rocks (Bone Spring formation), poorly exposed in the Guadalupe Mountains, are well exposed in the Sierra Diablo, with excellent three-dimensional control over the complex facies changes which take place at the margin of the Delaware Basin. The sea of early Bone Spring time transgressed an erosion surface of Wolfcampian and older rocks, leaving deposits which reveal many of the environmental conditions. Sediments deposited in the deeper waters of the Delaware Basin, and occasionally on the rim of the marginal shelf, are dark, platy carbonates representing an environment inimical to most forms of life. Immediately behind the transgressing shore line followed an environment of high organic activity. From these deposits large collections of silicified fossils have been obtained. The excellent preservation and ease of recovery of these fossils have permitted much more complete sampling of the fauna than had previously been possible. The nature of the material and its occurrence are such that many inferences may be made concerning the life requirements of the animals represented. The fauna is composed largely of brachiopods, a systematic study of which constitutes most of this contribution. This study has resulted in the recognition of 54 species, 36 of which are new, distributed among 45 genera, 12 of which are new. These 45 genera are distributed among 14 subfamilies, of which six are new, and among 15 families, of which four are new.

T1  - The systematic position of Lanthanotus and the affinities of the anguinomorphan lizards.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 105
SP  - 1
N2  - The external features of the Bornean lizard, Lanthanotus borneensis Steindachner, are described, together with the skull, the hyoid, the tongue, and the roentgenogram of the postcranial osteology. The various theories concerning the relationships of Lanthanotus are evaluated. The belief that Lanthanotus is related to the Chinese lizard Shinisaurus crocodilurus Ahl is shown to be unsupported by either the internal or external morphology. Nor is there evidence of close relationship between Lanthanotus and Heloderma, although these two genera are most frequently placed together in the family Helodermatidae. On the other hand, structural resemblances between Lanthanotus and Varanus are found to be both numerous and important. However, it is here shown that there is still greater affinity between Lanthanotus and three Cretaceous families believed to be closely related to Varanus, the Aigialosauridae, Mosasauridae, and Dolichosauridae. Lanthanotus represents a monotypic family closely related to aigialosaurs and dolichosaurs. Lanthanotus shows many of the features to be expected in an ancestor of the snakes, and the close similarities between Lanthanotus and the boid-like, colubrid-like, and particularly the leptotyphlopid snakes, materially strengthen the argument that the snakes are derived from platynotan (Varanus-like) lizards. In contrast to other limbless reptiles commonly referred to the Serpentes, the Typhlopidae show no particular resemblance in cranial structure to either the platynotan lizards or the snakes (including Leptotyphlops). Reasons are advanced for believing that the Typhlopidae are wrongly placed in the Serpentes (or Ophidia) and represent a line of anguinid-like lizards that has become convergent to the Serpentes. Incidental to the work upon which we base the conclusions summarized above, several additional observations have been made on the anatomy and relationships of the saurian infraorder Anguinomorpha. The most important conclusions reached are as follows: 1. The family Pygopodidae is not related to the Anguinomorpha but represents an aberrant line of geckos, modified by a reduction of the limbs but retaining many features of the gekkonids. 2. The family Cordylidae (long known as Zonuridae) is not related to the Anguinomorpha but instead is closely related to the Gerrhosauridae, a family that differs in relatively minor ways from the Lacertidae. 3.The fossil family Euposauridae, frequently placed in or near the Anguinomorpha, shows no clear evidence of affinity to the Anguinomorpha and is not even definitely referable to the Squamata. 4. After the removal of these three families, the Anguinomorpha become a natural group, the members of which are characterized by their peculiar tongue structure, their method of tooth replacement, and a unique combination of osteological characters. The group, here considered an infraorder, contains the families Anguinidae (Anguidae auct.), Xenosauridae, Anniellidae, Helodermatidae, Varanidae, Aigialosauridae, Mosasauridae, Dolichosauridae, and Lanthanotidae. 5. This group, the Anguinomorpha, appears to have undergone an early separation into two main lines of evolution, here considered taxonomically as two superfamilies: Diploglossa (or Anguinoidea) and Platynota (or Varanoidea). 6. The line here called Diploglossa (Anguinidae, Xenosauridae, and Anniellidae) includes the more primitive families, primarily adapted to a crushing action of the jaws, with rigid mandibles. None of the known forms can be considered directly ancestral to the platynotan line. 7. The remainder of the Anguinomorpha represent a line (Platynota or Varanoidea) the jaws of which are primarily adapted for a grasping action, with a progressive development through the families of a hinge in the middle of the ramus of the lower jaw. This line includes forms distinctly more predatory in habits than is usual in the members of the first line. 8. The beaded lizards (Heloderma) have most recently been classified among the members of the first (diploglossan) line. But careful study of the morphology of Heloderma shows it to be close to Varanus, and a member of the second (platynotan) series, as was believed by most of the earlier workers. Although specialized in many respects, in other features of its structure Heloderma appears to be near the ancestral form that gave rise to the Platynota. 9. Upon examination of the skull, the Chinese genus Shinisaurus of previously unknown affinities proves to be a close relative of the Mexican genus Xenosaurus. The fossil genera Exostinus, Melanosaurus, and Necrosaurus (also known as Palaeovaranus) also appear to be members of the Xenosauridae. A revised classification of the Anguinomorpha is presented.

N2  - The following are my conclusions which apply to true gall-wasps: 1. The closed radial cell of the wing is more primitive than the open cell; closed-cell genera or genera containing any species with the closed cell must be derived from closed-cell genera. 2. The arcuate first abscissa of the radius is more primitive than the angulate vein showing a projection into the radial cell; the character of this vein is of generic importance and the extent of development toward the angulate vein indicates, in general, the extent of evolution of the genus. 3. The size of the dorsal plate of the second abdominal segment is of generic significance; the smaller plate is more primitive; but this character among some Cynipini does not always show as great specialization as other characters in a genus, indicating diverse lines of evolution within the Cynipini. 4. The primitive Cynipidae were polyphagous; the restriction of Diastrophus mainly to Potentilla and Rubus, and the almost complete restriction of the Rhoditini to Rosa and of the Cynipini to Quercus show great specialization which occurred along three distinct lines of evolution. 5. The form of the gall is an indicator of the specific nature of the insect and also of the generic relations of the insect; the degree of complexity of the gall-structure is likewise an expression of the generic position of the insect, the simplest galls being produced by the most primitive gall-wasps, and the more complex galls by more specialized wasps. The primitive cynipids were plant-tissue inhabiting, not gall-making insects. 6. The primitive Cynipidae were bisexual species with normal, sexual reproduction. By the gradual disappearance of the male and the gradual increase of parthenogenetic reproduction, species have become agamic at several times along distinct lines of evolution within the history of the gall-wasps. 7. Alternation of generations is a development of seasonal dimorphism, a gradual evolution incited by the differences in the nature of existence in different parts of the host plant at different seasons of the year, and achieved after a struggle for the fixation of the new generation. Agamy is not the primitive method of reproduction; it is of great advantage to the winter generation of dimorphic cynipids, and may have originated because of this. 8. The highly specialized phenomena characteristic of the gall-wasps (gall production, agamic reproduction, and heterogeny) are of doubtful advantage, with the apparent consequences of the loss of vitality, exposure to the force of many enemies, and the ultimate extinction of the insects. 9. Aulacidea and Phanacis are in every respect the most primitive of the Cynipidae. 10. Timaspis is almost as primitive. 11. Aylax is primitive, but shows some specialization. 12. Diastrophus is derived from the Aulacidea-Aylax group. 13. Gonaspis is a specialized development of Diastrophus. 14. Rhodites, derived directly from from Aulacidea, is highly specialized. 15. Neuroterus is the most primitive of the Cynipini, and in that genus are to be discovered the incipient stages of some of the peculiar phenomena of the Cynipidae. 16. Disholcaspis, highly specialized in most respects, shows somewhat direct relationships to more primitive groups.

N2  - Study of adult gill-arch dentition of Recent and some fossil fishes suggested that the condition primitive for gnathostomes included numerous dermal elements, initially small but capable of growth. During evolution these small units apparently were organized into specialized structures of several types, through processes involving fusion between initially separate dermal elements, and in some cases fusion between the dermal skeleton and visceral endoskeleton. Advanced types of gill-arch dentition were found to characterize most of the major groups of fishes. These types, combined with characters of the gill-arch endoskeleton and related muscles, provided a basis for discussion of the phyletic interrelationships of all major fish groups represented in the Recent fauna. Concerning relationships, conclusions reached are in essential agreement with those of earlier workers. In addition, the basic branching of the gnathostomes appears to be consistent with the sister-group model of Hennig. On the basis of this agreement and consistency it was possible to propose a revised higher classification of fishes, proceeding from the assumption that sister-group relationships among Recent organisms must be expressed in the main outlines of a phyletic classification. Because it is generally agreed that tetrapods are related to rhipidistian fishes, it was possible to extend the classification to include the major groups of Recent tetrapods. The final result was a revised higher classification of the superclass Gnathostomata in which the major groups are arranged not arbitrarily but according to their probable phyletic interrelationships.

N2  - The American species of groupers constitute a block of serranid fishes which have been studied as a unit. Field investigation of their biology and life colors has supplemented laboratory studies on morphology, variation, and geographic distribution as indicated by existing museum specimens and literature records. Keys to the genera and species are given and previous literature is summarized in a synonymy for each species. 2. The groupers are moderate-sized to large-sized serranid fishes of warm seas. Most are solitary, reef-dwelling carnivores. In some areas they are the object of intensive, but local, commercial fisheries. Spawning takes place in the winter to late spring, depending on the latitude, but the manner of spawning is not known. The eggs are small, buoyant, and numerous. All of the species so far studied are protogynous. There is a pelagic larval stage during which the groupers can traverse great distances, but the adults are rather sedentary and probably rarely stray far from coral or rock reefs. 3. Groupers undergo considerable color variation of three types: 'instantaneous,' under nervous control; bathymetric, correlated with the environment, some species having strikingly different deep-water and shallow-water color phases; and xanthic, a yellow color phase under genetic control that characterizes small parts of the populations in a few species. A juvenile color phase different from that of the adult is present in some, but not all, species. 4. Osteological characters are useful in grouper classification and the osteology of Epinephelus guttatus is described in detail as a basis of comparison. 5. Subfamily names are not used in this report because present knowledge does not permit compartmentalization at that level. 6. The genus Paranthias is considered monotypic, with allopatric western Atlantic and eastern Pacific populations. 7. Twenty-one American species of Epinephelus are recognized. Seven distinct lines seem to be present. The nominal genera Cephalopholis, Petrometopon, Alphestes, Dermatolepis, Promicrops and Garrupa are placed in the synonymy of Epinephelus. Epinephelus niphobles is a synonym of E. niveatus, which thus has Atlantic and Pacific populations. Other species that occur on both sides of the Isthmus of Panama are Epinephelus nigritus, itajara, and probably mystacinus although the only Pacific record seems to be a small specimen from the Galápagos and this could be a locality error. 8. Two American species of the subgenus Dermatolepis are well differentiated, one on each side of the Central American Isthmus. 9. The eastern Pacific species previously known as Cephalopholis acanthistia is clearly a member of the E. niveatus species-group. 10. The transverse skull crests of Petrometopon are not sufficient grounds for recognizing it at either the generic or subgeneric levels. It is combined with Cephalopholis as a subgenus of Epinephelus. 11. Epinephelus afer occurs in the Pacific Ocean as well as in the Atlantic; E. multiguttatus is confined to the eastern Pacific. Apparently the subgenus Alphestes has twice invaded the eastern Pacific from the western Atlantic. 12. Thirteen species of Mycteroperca are recognized. These fall into two species-groups. 13. Some proportional measurements are relatively constant among most species of groupers. Others provide good generic and species-group characters and a few furnish useful species characters. Tables of measurements are given for each species except Mycteroperca prionura and M. cidi. 14. Barriers to dispersal and methods of transport of groupers are discussed. Three centers of distribution seem apparent: the eastern Pacific, the Gulf of Mexico, and the West Indies. There is a sharp faunal break across the Straits of Florida and the Gulf Stream seems to be an effective, although incomplete, barrier. There appear to be several levels of differentiation between species in these regions. These may be due in part to different rates of evolution, but are more probably a reflection of different periods of isolation. The last closure of the Middle America gap was late Pliocene and four species remain unchanged since that time. 15. A phylogeny of the American groupers is proposed that is based on the information available at this time.

T1  - The Enaliarctinae : a new group of extinct aquatic Carnivora and a consideration of the origin of the Otariidae.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 151
SP  - 203
N2  - The new genus and species Enaliarctos mealsi is based on two partial skulls and two natural endocranial casts discovered in the early Miocene Pyramid Hill Sand Member of the Jewett Sand at Pyramid Hill, Kern County, south-central California. The new mammalian subfamily Enaliarctinae is based on Enaliarctos mealsi. Enaliarctos mealsi was a medium-sized arctoid carnivore, a transitional species that departed in structure from terrestrial ursids (Hemicyoninae) and evolved in the direction of aquatic pinnipeds (Otariinae). Ursid features include presence and structure of upper and lower fourth premolars and of two molariform, quadrate-shaped upper molars; the development of sulcus cruciatus and the presence of an 'ursid lozenge'; and the morphology of the basicranium and middle ear. Features associated with aquatic adaptation include an enlarged narial chamber, reduced olfactory bulbs, wide snout, long and transversely arched palate, tendencies toward premolarization of the molars, narrow interorbital region, and enhanced brain circulation. A family Ursidae is recognized that includes primitive terrestrial ursids such as Cephalogale, Hemicyon, and Dinocyon in the subfamily Hemicyoninae. The Enaliarctinae is placed in Carnivora among the Otariidae near the Desmatophocinae. The Otariinae, specifically the Arctocephalini, might be descended from the Enaliarctinae. The phyletic lineage Hemicyoninae - Enaliarctinae - Otariinae emphasizes that the pinniped diphyly problem should be redefined to focus on the relationship of the Phocidae to even earlier Arctoidea. The Desmatophocinae might represent a third group independently derived from the middle-Tertiary adaptive radiation of Arctoidea. A lectotype for Neotherium mirum Kellogg, 1931 is chosen, and the species is included in the Enaliarctinae. The Pyramid Hill local fauna is named and characterized. The fauna comprises invertebrates and more than 39 species of Elasmobranchii, Teleostei, Chelonia, Aves, Squalodontidae (with a summary of northeast Pacific records), Delphinoidea, Mysticeti, Carnivora, Equidae (Anchitherium cf. A. agatensis), and Tayassuidae (Desmathyus sp.). The composition of the fauna indicates a warm-water, near-shore environment at the site of deposition. The Woody local fauna is named, characterized, and discussed. It is slightly higher stratigraphically in the same rock unit, 14 miles north of Pyramid Hill. We question Wilson's (1935) identifications of otariid pinnipeds from these rocks and doubt the validity of the 'phocid' record. The Pyramid Hill Sand can be assigned to the later Arikareean Land Mammal Age and to the Vaqueros Molluscan Stage, and it lies close to or includes the boundary between the Zemorrian and Saucesian Foraminiferal stages.

T1  - A monographic study of the colubrid snake genus Leptodeira.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 114
SP  - 1
N2  - The genus Leptodeira Fitzinger, 1843, includes as absolute synonyms the generic names Megalops Hallowell, 1861, Anoplophallus Cope, 1893, and Pseudoleptodeira Taylor, 1938. Nine species comprise the genus; five of these are monotypic; one embraces five subspecies, one includes four subspecies, and two others each contain three subspecies, making a total of 20 forms. Two subspecies are described as new in this paper. The genus is characterized by maxillary teeth that increase in size posteriorly followed by a diastema and two enlarged, grooved fangs. There are two apical pits, elliptical pupil, divided anal, smooth dorsal scales, normal complement of colubrid head shields, and a capitate hemipenis with many large spines. Four species groups are separated on the nature of the hemipenes, the dentition and certain skull elements, particularly the quadrates, vomers, and maxillaries. Analysis of the characters shows that the most useful in a systematic study of the snakes are the numbers of ventrals, caudals, and dorsal scale rows, the numbers of upper labials and preocular scales, the number, shape, and size of the body blotches, and the nature of the dorsal head pattern. Analysis of numerous character clines shows that parallel clines may exist in two or more species in certain characters, but that in others the clines may diverge. Discontinuous clines are common. In some cases these are correlated with striking morphological changes between populations and become incorporated in the characteristics of subspecies. Studies of the skull of Leptodeira indicate that the skull is a normal colubrid type without striking specializations. Certain skeletal elements readily identify it from related genera. The poison glands (modified posterior portions of parotid glands) are large and produce a venom of sufficient strength to kill small frogs and lizards. The distribution of the genus is essentially throughout the American tropics to elevations of about 2000 meters. Some forms are restricted to semi-arid habitats; others live in tropical rain forest. Two species range from semi-arid to wet forest environments; each has a subspecies adapted to arboreal life in the forest by having a reduced number of dorsal scale rows, enlarged vertebral and paravertebral scale rows, and a laterally compressed body. Snakes of this genus feed primarily on frogs and toads; some lizards are included in the diet. The snakes are nocturnal and appear to reach their greatest abundance at times of congregations of breeding frogs. So far as is known, all species are oviparous and may lay as many as 13 eggs. On penial characters Leptodeira may be placed with Hypsiglena and Trimorphodon as a subgroup of colubrine snakes. If Leptodeira is related to Trimorphodon, they must have diverged early in their evolutionary history. Hypsiglena and Leptodeira are closely related and evolved from a common ancestral stock. The African snakes of the genus Crotaphopeltis that have been placed in the genus Leptodeira represent a separate evolutionary line of colubrine snakes. Based on the Cenozoic history of tropical America, studies of the morphology and distribution of the snakes, and the fossil record of other animals, the evolutionary history of Leptodeira has been reconstructed. This shows that Leptodeira and Hypsiglena underwent generic differentiation from a common ancestral stock in southern México during the early Miocene. By middle Miocene time the groups of Leptodeira had diverged. The present distribution and differentiation are a result of the effects of sea portals across Middle America that isolated populations often for long periods of time, and the Cenozoic orogenies that changed the uniform climatic conditions of Middle America and produced arid as well as humid habitats.

The gross morphology of digestive tracts of all the suborders of the Plectognathi are described from representatives, with especial reference to the development of the mechanism of inflation. 2. The structure and operation of the inflation mechanism are discussed in detail. 3. The capacity for inflation of Spheroides maculatus is shown to vary directly with the length of the fish and to be proportional to the volume of a sphere, the diameter of which is 61 per cent of the standard length. 4. The comparative ontogeny of the various groups is discussed. 5. The ontogeny of Acanthostracion quadricornis is described and figured and shown to resemble that of the Gymnodontes more closely than that of the Sclerodermi. 6. The phylogeny of the Plectognathi is discussed in its broader aspects.

N2  - The Arapaho bäyaa[superscript n]wu consists of a form of the widely spread sun-dance and of a series of men's ceremonies graded by age, and a single but analogous ceremony for women. The men's ceremonies are performed by groups of men of the same age. These companies are not voluntary organization, but consist of all the individuals of a certain age in the tribe. There is a symbolic reference to war in most of the ceremonies; and the companies, or sometimes certain members of them, have social and warlike functions. All the ceremonies are under the direction of the members of the oldest society. Intermediary between these and the dancers are men known as the dancers' grandfathers, who instruct them in the parts to play in the ceremony, and provide them with regalia. The ceremonies are held in a lodge in the centre of the camp-circle, and consist of a three days' period of dancing. Very characteristic of these ceremonies are the numerous degrees of rank, which are indicated by differences in regalia. These differences in rank do not depend at all upon any previous religious experience or training. They have little purpose except their own existence, and are bestowed a marks of honor. While there are many similarities of detail between the sun-dance and the age-ceremonies of the bäyaa[superscript n]wu, due to their being ceremonies of the same tribe, there is nevertheless a fundamental difference in scope and character.

T1  - The influence of light and darkness on thyroid and pituitary activity of the characin Astyanax mexicanus and its cave derivatives.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 93
SP  - 501
N2  - One. The eyed, river-dwelling characin, Astyanax mexicanus, can live for apparently indefinite periods in total darkness, but under such conditions develops hyperplasia of the thyroid, reduction in the relative number of pituitary basophiles, reduction in the size of the gonads, and an alteration in body form caused by the accumulation of subdermal fat. 2. The blind, cave-dwelling derivatives of Astyanax thrive in either light or darkness, and under either condition show no reduction in size of the gonads nor any change in body form. The form from La Cueva Chica may exhibit a slightly increased thyroid activity in the light, and deposits additional quantities of subdermal guanin. The form from Cueva de los Sabinos shows neither of these reactions. 3. When either river or cave fish that have been raised in the light are placed in darkness, no reduction in guanin takes place. 4. For comparison, young Ameiurus were similarly treated and showed a slight rise in thyroid activity in darkness. 5. Blinded river fish kept in the light show no morphological changes like those exhibited by individuals kept in the dark. Therefore enforced activity caused by the impossibility of optical fixation in the river fish in the dark cannot be the cause of increased thyroid activity, since the blinded fish kept in the light are forced into the same activity without subsequent increase in the height of the thyroid epithelium. 6. Hyperplasia of the thyroid in the normal river fish in light may be produced by treatment with thiourea, and a decrease in thyroid activity in river fish kept in the dark may be produced by feeding desiccated mammalian thyroid. In the first case the condition approximates that found in the untreated fish living in the dark, and in the latter the decrease may exceed that of normal fish living in the light. 7. The development of aberrant features in river fish kept in the dark and the lack of these features in their cave-dwelling derivatives may indicate that the latter have developed some modification of the endocrine system that enables them to function normally in the total darkness of caves. 8. Because of these reactions of the river fish to a totally dark environment, the present extensive cave populations may have been established by a few fish from the river that were able to make the appropriate endocrine adjustment, or from the eggs of river fish spawned in the cave before the influence of darkness had disturbed the endocrine balance sufficiently to make reproduction impossible. None of the present experimental animals was able to make such an adjustment. The physiological behavior of fish produced from eggs hatched in darkness is yet to be determined.

N2  - One. The possible reactions open to fishes in regard to attack, feeding needs, social behavior, pigmentation, time, and space may be conveniently tabulated in thoretical terms. 2. The actual reactions observed in a variety of fishes compared with the theoretical tabulation show that illustrations filling nearly every category exist. 3. Included in such illustrative material are new data on the pigmentary and associated behavioral reactions of Manta, Strongylura, Hippocampus, Hepsetia, Sphyraena, Coryphaena, Apogonichthys, Pomacentrus, Abudefduf, Halichoeres, Thalassoma, Holocentrus, Bathygobius, Gnatholepis, Stathmonotus, Canthigaster, Histrio, Antennarius, and Ogcocephalus. 4. These data indicate that study in greater and more exact detail must be made of the total behavior of a given species in reference to its pigmentary changes before any clear picture can be had of the full significance of the activity of the pigmentary system. 5. A scheme for representing the relationships between various factors in the survival of organisms, covering cases where pairs of factors are supplementary and cases where they are opposed, is found convenient when discussing their various reactive patterns.

T1  - Studies of North American scorpions of the genera Uroctonus and Vejovis (Scorpionida, Vejovidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 148
SP  - 549
N2  - A systematic review of some American vejovine scorpions is presented with analyses of their characters and relationships. The subfamily Uroctoninae is rejected as a synonym of the Vejovinae. The genus Uroctonus, heretofore represented by the single taxon mordax, is redefined and the number of species increased to 14. Most of the characters on which the genus Uroctonus was formerly based were found to be intergradient to those of Vejovis. Although the genus is maintained on the basis of a combination of characters, it seems clear that the species were derived from the same basic stock. The trichobothrial patterns of Uroctonus and Vejovis are essentially identical and dffer strikingly from those of the related genera Anuroctonus and Hadrurus. The genotype Uroctonus mordax ranges from Oregon south into southern California and lives mostly in mesic, mountainous habitats. Most of the new species occur in California and Baja California but three others are found from southern Arizona to western Texas and Chihuahua. Two of the species, montereus and sequoia, are unusual in having only a single subdistal tooth present on the outer carina of the movable finger of the chelicera, instead of the normal two of the subfamily. A pale species with small eyes and slender, smooth cauda, grahami from Samwell Cave in California, seems to be a cave-adapted type, but its modifications may only indicate an endogean habit. Descriptions of various species of Vejovis are also included in the present paper. The identity of Vejovis minimus Kraepelin has been established by study of the type material from the Zoologisches Museum in Hamburg, Germany.

T1  - Systematics and behavior of South American flickers (Aves, Colaptes).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 149
SP  - 1
N2  - The genus Colaptes is comprised of eight species, formerly arranged in the genera Colaptes, Nesoceleus, and Chrysoptilus. More or less distinct forms hybridize in secondary contacts within four of the eight species. The six South American species constitute two subgroups; the forest, or green, flickers, which are more arboreal and more closely resemble the ancestor of Colaptes, and the ground flickers, which are to a high degree terrestrially adapted, live in open country, and represent the most specialized species of the genus. The North American Colaptes auratus resembles the green flicker group more than it does the ground flickers; it is probably independently derived from an ancestor of the former group. Two well-marked races comprise the somewhat xeric-adapted C. atricollis, which is morphologically and behaviorally unspecialized. Several races are included in C. punctigula, which is partly ground-foraging and the only truly tropical flicker. Colaptes melanochloros forms a superspecies with punctigula, and it is comprised of two distinctive racial groups, by some authors considered species. The melanochloros group of more arboreal, woodland and savanna populations is arranged in two distinct races, melanochloros and nattereri, which intergrade over a large part of southern Brazil. Three much less strongly marked subspecies, melanolaimus, leucofrenatus, and nigroviridis, constitute the melanolaimus group, which inhabits more open country and woodland edges and is partly ground-foraging. The two groups interbreed freely in Corrientes, Argentina, in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and probably in south-central Paraguay, although rather effectively isolated by the Paraguay River in northern Paraguay. Colaptes pitius, a monotypic, forest-edge species of Patagonia and Chile, forages on the ground and nests either arboreally or terrestrially. The northern Andean C. rupicola is composed of a southern group of two moderately differentiated races, rupicola and puna, and a morphologically distinct north Peruvian race, cinereicapillus, which also differs somewhat in behavior from the southern forms. Contact between cinereicapillus and the more southern forms is limited topographically and ecologically; interbreeding occurs, with some introgression. This highland species is highly social, completely terrestrial, and is the only flicker that does not subsist mainly on ants. There are two rather weakly marked races of the terrestrial C. campestris, northern campestris with a black throat and southern campestroides with a white throat. These races have come into secondary contact recently, and they interbreed in the only major area of contact, central Paraguay. Slightly less social than rupicola, campestris nests in the ground or in fence posts or trees. It is morphologically and behaviorally distinctive, and it appears to be the most specialized of the flickers. The habits, vocalizations, and displays of the various flickers show many similarities. The ground flickers have the most distinct behavioral features, many of which (e.g., walking gait, sociality, yelping calls, wing-flicking display) seem to be adaptations for a terrestrial mode of life. Sympatry within the genus is uncommon and occurs only between distantly related species with divergent plumage patterns and habits. Greater speciation in South America compared with North America probably reflects greater opportunities for speciation on the former continent. Colaptes evolved from an arboreal, ant-eating woodpecker that resembled modern species of Piculus (e.g., rivolii); these genera are very closely related.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 115
SP  - 117
N2  - The two genera of West Indian insectivores, Solenodon and Nesophontes, have been placed in separate superfamilies, Tenrecoidea and Soricoidea, respectively. This classification is based primarily on the sculpture of the lingual portion of the upper molars. Examination of the skull, however, reveals very close agreement between the two genera, and this agreement is seen further in the form of the buccal portion of the molars. So close is the apparent relationship between the two genera that they are here placed in the same family, Solenodontidae. The fossil (Oligocene) genus Apternodus is not even a member of the same order (Lipotyphla) as its supposed relative Solenodon. Apternodus is so peculiarly specialized that its relationships are obscure, but its basicranial structure suggests creodont, rather than insectivore, affinities. Palaeoryctes (Puerco), supposed to be an ancestral zalambdodont, is not related to any of the living zalambdodont groups, bearing only an equivocal dental resemblance to modern forms and showing a creodont-like rather than lipotyphlan-like basicranium. It is suggested that the families Deltatheridiidae and Palaeoryctidae be merged, under the latter name. A classification of the lipotyphlous insectivores is presented, based primarily on cranial structure: Order Lipotyphla. Suborder Erinaceomorpha. Family Erinaceidae, family Dimylidae, family Talpidae. Suborder Soricomorpha. Superfamily Tenrecoidea. Family Tenrecidae, family Chrysochloridae. Superfamily Soricoidea. Family Solenodontidae, family Soricidae. Solenodon and Nesophontes appear to represent a line that separated from a presoricid stem not later than the Upper Eocene, and there is no reason to believe that the divergence of the two genera did not take place in the West Indies.

VL  - 92

N2  - One. Regular inhabitants of Bahama tide pools maintain their residence for long periods, extending at least between drying on successive spring tides. 2. Peck-order hierarchies of some stability are established in these tide pools which are interspecific and evidently depend to a considerable extent on size and darkness of coloration. 3. The contents of such tide pools may be divided into typical species which are dominant and show specializations associated with tide-pool life, casual species which are less abundant and show no obvious tide-pool specialization but are well accommodated to them, and accidental species which are rare and evidently not suited to such places in which they are apparently occasionally trapped. 4. Species in the area studied which are here considered as typical include Bathygobius soporator and Salarichthys textilis; those considered as casual include the young of Eupomacentrus leucostictus, E. adustus, Abudefduf analogus, and A. saxatilis; while those considered as accidental include Jenkinsia lamprotaenia, the young of Mugil trichodon, Eucinostomus gula, Eques pulcher, Pomacanthus aureus, Acanthurus hepatus, and Thalassoma bifasciatum. 5. In addition to respiratory specializations and the ability to leave a given pool and move overland, the typical species are able to and do match the bottom on which they rest to a remarkable degree, while the casuals in no case show such adjustments, their bright colors making them conspicuous to a notable extent. 6. The typical species are strictly carnivorous and prey to some slight extent on the casuals, but the latter as well as the accidentals are all non-predatory, subsisting on such vegetable and animal matter as they may obtain by picking at growths on the substrate or grubbing in the sand. 7. The typical tide-pool species, and Eupomacentrus among the casuals, spend much time going in and out of cavities such as empty shells, the former both day and night while the latter spend the entire night hidden in such places. All the rest spend the night resting in open places, with the exception of Thalassoma which evidently spends the night under cover. 8. Both Eucinostomus gula and young Sphyraena barracuda inhabit open, shallow, sandy beaches and show a bottom-matching mottling over mottled bottom, but become plain and also bottom matching over clean sand with the exception of certain fin tips which become intensely black. 9. The fact that the black pupil of the eye cannot be faded suggests that the fin tip is in some way connected with this fact in reference to recognition or confusion. 10. Other fishes of these same clean beach areas that show similar black-and-white patterns, involving only the fin tips, include, besides the above, adult Mugil trichodon and young Trachinotus palometa. 11. Both young and adult of Chaetodipterus faber, in the very clear water of this region (in contrast to their chromatic behavior in places of greater turbidity), when on clear stretches of sand show their blackest phase and recline on one side, resembling a piece of inert trash, but when in the area of a dock right themselves and hide among the piles with their boldest pattern of black-and-white vertical bars. 12. Since the more usual background-matching behavior of other fishes makes it possible only for blind fish to show their darkest phase when in light on a light background, it follows that the visual-hormonal control of melanophores in Chaetodipterus must operate in a different manner. 13. The fish Astrapogon, inquiline in Strombus gigas, shows an approximately equal infestation of this mollusk irrespective of the concentration of the latter, but only in inside sheltered waters, and it is evidently absent from the relatively unsheltered Strombus samba. About one Strombus in 12 was found to be inhabited by an Astrapogon in sheltered places. 14. The spawning season of Astrapogon begins in August in this region.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 157
SP  - 489
N2  - A theory of relationships is presented in which the Jurassic turtle genera Portlandemys and Plesiochelys are hypothesized as members of the monophyletic group Chelonioidea based on the possession of the following shared derived characters: 1) dorsum sellae high and separated from sella turcica and foramen anterius canalis carotici interni by prominent bone surface that usually has a sagittal ridge, 2) posterior part of sella turcica not concealed by overhanging dorsum sellae. The relationships of these genera within the Chelonioidea are more difficult to test owing to the fact that at present only the Recent forms are cranially as well known as Portlandemys and Plesiochelys. Nonetheless, I have suggested two contradictory hypotheses, one indicating Plesiochelys and Portlandemys as the sister group of the Dermochelyidae plus Cheloniidae, and the other indicating Plesiochelys as the sister group of the Toxochelyidae, Dermochelyidae, and Cheloniidae. The first hypothesis is consistent with derived characters of the palatine artery, whereas the second is consistent with postcranial derived characters.

T1  - Shell ultrastructure of the Atlantidae (Heteropoda, Mesogastropoda) Oxygyrus and Protatlanta, with comments on Atlanta inclinata.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 157
SP  - 265
N2  - The purpose of the present study is to describe and interpret the wall ultrastructure of three atlantid heteropod species for phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis; they are Oxygyrus keraudreni, Protatlanta souleyeti, and Atlanta inclinata found in shallow waters of subtropic and tropic oceanic regions. Whereas most other members of predominantly thick-shelled, benthic mesogastropod families have three or more calcified crossed-lamellar layers termed here 'normal,' the exceedingly thin-walled planktonic atlantids have highly modified, crossed-lamellar layers termed here 'Type-2.' This 'Type-2' structure was perhaps derived from the normal mesogastropod type structure as a result of thinness of the wall, as this structure has been observed in unrelated thin-shelled taxa, such as pteropods (opisthobranchs), scissurellids (archaeogastropods), and early embryonic stages of fissurellids (archaeogastropods). An important variation is that both the first-order lamellae and the second-order rods may be rigid 'Type-2,' sigmoidal, or curved so that a layer may resemble helical structure. A new type of prismatic layer, asymmetric prismatic, is described and distinguished from simple prismatic, apertural prismatic, and myostracal structure. Variations of ultrastructure within samples of Oxygyrus keraudreni from the same population were found to have variant patterns identical with those of distant populations. Ornamented and unornamented embryonic Protatlanta souleyeti were found within populations in about the same ratio. The wall structure among Oxygyrus keraudreni, Protatlanta souleyeti, and Atlanta inclinata is distinct, with variations that can be used to distinguish each species. Embryonic variations of ultrastructure are characterized by changing thickness of wall structure during growth, whereas adult variations of ultrastructure are characterized by morphologic changes within a specific wall unit type. A study of heteropod material from plankton tows and bottom dredges failed to establish any recognizable difference in alteration of ultrastructure by selective solution in deep sea sediments. Both types of samples displayed about the same degree of alteration, implying that factors either biological or chemical are operating on individuals even during their life cycle.

N2  - The genus Thalerophis Oliver is composed of six species; four of these are monotypic, one embraces two subspecies, and another contains 12 subspecies. All have the posteriormost maxillary teeth enlarged but not grooved; the hemipenis may or may not have enlarged basal spines; the dorsal scale formula is 15-15-11, and keels are present on the scales of at least two rows; the ventrals vary in number from 133 to 184 plates; the upper labials are eight or nine in number, with two shields in contact with the orbit; the loreal shield is present or absent; the oculars are one preocular and two postoculars; the temporals normally consist of one anterior and two posterior shields; and all have some green in the coloration, which in the adults is usually a uniform green or with dark longitudinal stripes, but one species has an adult color pattern of narrow, dark transverse bands. The genus occurs in the warm, relatively humid lowlands of the mainland of Latin America from northern Mexico to northern Argentina. The members of the genus are semi-arboreal or arboreal inhabitants of the forested areas: the tropical and subtropical rain forest, the tropical deciduous forest, and the scrub forests of the Neotropical realm. They are oviparous and feed principally on frogs of the family Hylidae. The genus is a part of the Old Northern colubrine stock that has entered Middle and South America from the north and has undergone subsequent evolution in these areas. It appears to be most closely related to the genera Drymobius and Dryadophis which are also inhabitants of the Neotropical region. Thalerophis probably originated in lower Central America from which region it has spread northward into upper Central America and southward into virtually all of the warm, humid, lowland, forest areas.

T1  - Mechanisms of sound production in the ariid catfishes Galeichthys and Bagre.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 124
SP  - 1
N2  - The skeletal basis of the sound producing mechanism in the ariid catfishes Galeichthys felis and Bagre marinus consists of a thin shelf of bone which is firmly attached to the anterior dorsal wall of the swim bladder. This so-called 'elastic spring,' or 'Springfederapparat,' is formed from the parapophysis of the fourth vertebra. The anterior ramus of this parapophysis, herein named the 'Müllerian ramus' (after Johannes Müller who, in 1842, first described the structure), is the main vibrating element in sound production. The skulls and anterior vertebral complexes of Galeichthys and Bagre are figured and described, with comparisons with a non-sonic silurid form, Wallago. The 'protractor muscle' (so named by Bridge and Haddon in 1893) which activates the Müllerian ramus is a highly vascularized conical muscle, the origin of which is on the under side of the epiotic lamina and insertion on the Müllerian ramus. It is innervated by the dorsal branch of the occipital nerve. The relationship of this nerve to the cranial nerves of higher vertebrates is controversial, but it is probably homologous with the hypoglossal (XII). Stimulation of the protractor muscle or its nerve supply with repetitive spike-form potentials results in an audible sound output from the Springfederapparat. This response can be recorded and analyzed, and its fundamental pitch is equivalent to the pulse frequency of the stimulus. The protractor muscle is remarkable in that it can withstand stimulations of 300 or more pulses per second without going into immediate tetany. In Bagre, the frequency response of the sonic system is about an octave higher than that in Galeichthys. Spontaneous sounds from these species consist of low-pitched grunts (fundamental pitch of about 150 cycles per second) and, in Bagre, higher, sob-like sounds (400 cycles per second or over). The harmonic components of both artificially induced and spontaneous sounds can be influenced by the amount of sound reflectance in the external environment. Even under partially anechoic conditions, the sound output is virtually a pure tone. Damage to the swim bladder reduces the amplitude of the sound but not its timbre (i.e., harmonic content). It was concluded that the swim bladder does not serve as a resonating chamber for these sounds, nor is it a true amplifier. Rather, it transfers the energy from the small area of the vibrating Müllerian ramus to the larger area of its entire outer surface, thus making the propagation of the sound from its source to the water more efficient. In acoustical and electronic terms, the swim bladder is an impedance matching device.

T1  - On the breeding behavior of the cock-of-the-rock (Aves, Rupicola rupicola).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 124
SP  - 35
N2  - Ethological observations of the breeding behavior of the cock-of-the-rock as observed in 1961 in the mountain forest of the Kanuku Mountains, British Guiana, are reported. Three dancing arenas were studied. At one, observations were made over a period of 20 consecutive days. The behavior of the cocks in their display arena is described, and their display attitudes and their display paraphernalia are illustrated. It was found that a clan of three cocks, each with its own terrestrial lek, joined forces to defend a social display arena some 70 feet in diameter in the mountain forest. The clan males lived in and around this arena almost continuously. The females lived apart from the males in the vicinity of a nesting cave 625 feet from the display arena. In this cave were four nests on which the females habitually slept and on which they often perched by day. The interactions between adult males, between adult males and a wandering clan of young males, and between the adult males and females are described. The adult males posture stiffly on their ground leks when a female visits the arena. They resemble bits of gold carpet on the brown floor of the forest. The manner in which the female signals a prospective mate is described. A general description of the ecology and meteorology of the Kanuku Mountains precedes a discussion of arena behavior in general. In the latter are comments on the biological advantages of this form of breeding behavior, and its probable mode of evolution. The advantages are postulated as resulting from the greater expendability of the males (a much smaller percentage of each generation is needed for the perpetuation of the species), permitting more severe selection and consequently more rapid evolutionary advancement. Arena behavior in the cock-of-the-rock is postulated as having arisen as a fortuitous result of the division of work between the sexes. This division is postulated as having resulted from two forces that may have been working simultaneously: natural selection in the direction of cryptic coloration in the parent attending the nest, and sexual selection in the direction of brighter plumage and conspicuous patterns of behavior in the male. The peculiar stationary terrestrial postures of the males on their private leks are thought to have resulted in part from relict tendencies (displacement activities) for nest building and nest care. These tendencies are postulated as having been superimposed on the pattern of courtship. The nests are built of mud droplets gathered by the female. One nest weighed 8 1/2 pounds. The carrying of this amount of mud must have required many hundreds of visits to the ground by the female. Therefore ground visiting (like nest building) is believed to be a deep-seated activity, a fixed action pattern, of the central nervous system which is far more easily diverted than dropped, which is an added reason for assuming that lek building and arena behavior evolved largely as displacement activities for nest building and nest care--activities that doubtless were once components of the behavior of the males of the primitive cotinga from which the cock-of-the-rock originated. An outline of arena behavior throughout the world is given. The hypothesis is advanced that arena behavior has a common origin in all the birds that practice it. It is courtship behavior as reshaped by emancipated males to include their non-discardable nesting tendencies, as is postulated for the cock-of-the-rock. The taxonomic conclusion is reached that, despite its manakin-like ethology, Rupicola is probably closely allied to Procnias.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 122
SP  - 1
N2  - The discovery is reported of a third line of evidence which separates the large tribe of Oriental tree squirrels Callosciurini from the Holarctic members of the tribe Sciurini and also associates the widely disjunct Bornean tassel-eared squirrel Reithrosciurus with the Holarctic Sciurini. The third line of evidence is the number of pairs of functional mammae, which are four in the Holarctic Sciurini but only two or three in the Callosciurini. Data in the new line of evidence are presented for samples of 34 of the 37 genera of the subfamily Sciurinae of diurnal squirrels. Their significance to the interrelationships of the eight tribes and their constituent subtribes and genera and occasionally lower categories is evaluated. In general the new line of evidence is equivocal or supports the latest classification of the subfamily Sciurinae. It also suggests some minor refinements. For example, within the large Oriental squirrel subgenus Callosciurus a previously unsuspected division of the species is discovered that separates grossly the Malaysian from the Indo-Chinese species. The species of the Indo-Chinese Subregion have two pairs of mammae; those of the Malaysian Subregion, generally three. In addition to being of systematic value in its geographic variation, the number of pairs of functional mammae is shown to vary with latitude. The number of pairs generally decreases from boreal and temperate climates to tropical. Data from the literature on the size of the brood are presented which reveal that it is correlated with a reduction in mammae from temperate to tropical climates. In the tree squirrels as a whole and in the ground squirrels as a whole, there seems to be a strong trend of larger towards smaller broods from the north temperate climates to tropical climates. This trend corresponds with the decrease in the size of the clutch in birds from the north temperate to tropical climates, but in squirrels the trend seems also to be correlated with a meristic morphological difference--the number of pairs of mammae. No clear answer is at hand for an important question concerning evolution: Do the squirrels of the temperate climate with more mammae and larger broods actually produce more young per year? A definite north-to-south increase of broods from one to two broods per year is found in Nearctic ground squirrels. Data from Funambulus pennanti in India and three species of Callosciurus in Malaya hint that the females of tropical species may rear three or four broods in a single year, instead of one or two as do their relatives in more northern latitudes.

VL  - 123
SP  - 159
N2  - The lizards of the sexlineatus species group constitute the largest group within the genus Cnemidophorus and occupy the greatest geographic area, from Honduras to Maryland and westward to Arizona and northern Baja California. The taxonomic arrangement of the lizards of this group that has been developing over the 30 years since Burt (1931a) placed all forms described in two species (one with three subspecies) reveals a far more complicated situation than earlier authors appreciated. Within approximately the last decade, the application of more refined methods of study, together with a knowledge of the appearance of the animals in life and of their ecology, has greatly increased the understanding of variation and distribution. In the present report we recognize 17 species and 31 forms. The impetus for the preparation of the present report was provided by the discovery that one of the oldest, hence taxonomically most important, names in the genus, sackii Wiegmann, 1834, was misapplied. A simple shift of names or an application to the International Commission for conservation of names would scarcely remedy the situation satisfactorily, for a number of distinct species and subspecies would still remain buried in synonymy. This report, then, establishes the true identity of Cnemidophorus sacki as the form previously called C. sacki australis and redistributes the forms recently assigned to C. sacki among seven species. The arrangement given is assuredly not final, but it provides a working basis for future studies. With future workers in mind, we draw attention throughout this paper to the outstanding problems and point out where, particularly in the field, effort most profitably can be expended. We realize, however, that our colleagues may come, with Shakespeare, to feel that ''Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind' (King Lear).

N2  - The Carmen Island area appears to be of significant ecologic importance with respect to the Foraminifera in the Gulf of California. Both northern and southern faunas show increased rates of change in this region. Squires (1959, p. 395) shows that a gradual diminution of hermatypic coral fauna occurs in the Gulf from El Pulmo (latitude 23 26' N.) to South San Lorenzo (latitude 28 35' N.) north of Salinas Bay, Carmen Island. At South San Lorenzo kelp replaces Porites, and Pavona and Pocillopora were not found. This area also marks the approximate northern limit of several tropical forms that were found in the present collection, of which the frequencies range as high as 65 per cent, and average 15 per cent of those of the southern populations. The distinctive character of the northern populations is due not only to the absence of these significant tropical species, but also to the greater abundance of several previously mentioned subtropical species, such as Eponides hannai, Elphidium gunteri, and Cibicides concentricus. A graphic analysis of the southern and northern populations shows a greater decrease in the number of species in the Carmen Island area (samples 41-49). With respect to the Foraminifera, the Gulf, therefore, is believed to support a tropical fauna as far north as the twenty-sixth parallel (Carmen Island area). To the north the Gulf supports a more or less thinned-out, warm-water fauna which has most of its species in common with the southern population, but with a greater frequency of some typical subtropical forms. Colder minimum temperatures to the north are presumed to be the main factor influencing this distribution. In general the Buliminidae and Cassidulinidae dominated the deeper-water samples; Cassidulina subglobosa and Bulimina denudata are typical examples. A study of the geographical affinities of the foraminiferal population of the Gulf indicates that the number (27.3%) of species that are endemic to the eastern Pacific warm water is larger than the number that are Amphi-American (20.2%), although the difference is not so great as that shown in a similar study made on crabs and echinoderms of the eastern Pacific (Eckman, 1953, p. 40). The percentage of circumtropical species in the Foraminifera (30.9%) was larger than in the megafauna (2%). This fact may be attributed to the greater capacity of the Foraminifera to be carried by ocean currents for great distances. Only a small percentage (4.3%) of the Foraminifera show affinities with the Indo-Pacific region. Depth is considered to be the main factor that influences the foraminiferal number of the samples. The deeper samples usually contain the highest F.N. values, except for a few bioclastic areas supporting prolific populations. The writer wishes to suggest further directions of study that might lead to the solution of important zoogeographical problems in the area. Foraminiferal populations can be studied in Recent samples collected between San Diego, California, and Cape San Lucas, at the tip of Baja California. With methods similar to those of this study, it may be possible to delineate more accurately the northern limits of the Panamic (tropical) Province. Late Tertiary samples taken throughout the extent of Baja California can be statistically analyzed, and the geographic ranges of the Foraminifera can be compared with those in this study. Such studies might indicate significant shifts in the tropical and subtropical fauna and aid in the interpretation of broad paleoecological problems.

T1  - Late Paleozoic sponge faunas of the Texas region : the siliceous sponges.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 120
SP  - 1
N2  - The present paper is a taxonomic and faunal study of the siliceous sponges of the later Pennsylvanian and Permian of the mid-continent region, including the standard Permian section of west Texas. It is based primarily on large collections at the United States National Museum and at the American Museum of Natural History, as well as on the type specimens of all previously described species from the same area. A general introductory discussion reviews the composition and historical development of the entire sponge faunas of the area and geologic systems studied, including the calcareous sponges which are not treated taxonomically here. The sponge faunas discussed here are the most diverse known in the geologic record between the Devonian and the Jurassic. The siliceous sponges dealt with in the present paper constitute about half of the total sponge fauna in terms of numbers of species. Forty-three named species are described, plus nine new but unnamed forms. Three new superfamilies, seven new families, 17 new genera, and 32 new species have been established. The anatomy of Heliospongia has been reinterpreted on the basis of excellently preserved material, and it has been placed among the monactinellid demosponges. The evolution of the hexactinellids has been reconsidered, and it is concluded that in the early Paleozoic two main lines diverged from a common stock, one of which gave rise to many later dictyonines. In the descriptions of individual species, particular attention has been paid to individual variation, to ontogenetic development, and to evidences for ecological relationships exhibited by the specimens. The large size of the collections and the generally excellent preservation of the material have made such aspects of the study feasible. Only those species represented by nearly complete specimens have been named, for isolated spicules or small fragments of sponges provide insufficient morphological information. Faunal facies can be recognized, which are related to bathymetry inferred from physical stratigraphic evidence. These are similar in distribution to present communities of sponges. The shoal-water faunas were dominated by calcareous sponges and the deeper-water faunas by siliceous sponges. Evidence is presented that the marginal areas of the stagnant-basin facies of the Texas Permian were not completely anaerobic, despite the high organic content of the sediment, because the sponges and some of the associated faunal elements were autochthonous to the sediments. The late Paleozoic shoal-water sponge fauna in the Texas region shows a continuous and partly endemic development. A significant external faunal element appears at the beginning of the Leonardian. Stratigraphic zonation of the sponges tends to confirm that established on the basis of the other faunal elements. The taxonomic composition of the Permian sponge faunas, in relation to earlier and later faunas, indicates that the Paleozoic-Mesozoic boundary is marked by the extinction of several long-ranging Paleozoic families that flourished until the end of the Permian. The dominant groups of Mesozoic sponges, on the other hand, were already present in the late Paleozoic and seem not to have been affected by the post-Permian withdrawal of epicontinental seas.

T1  - Permian and Eotriassic bivalves of the Middle Rockies.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 125
SP  - 1
N2  - The Permian-Triassic succession in the Middle Rockies of North America records one of the major gaps in the history of fossil invertebrates. Bivalve mollusks are the only invertebrates that are major components of both the Permian and the Eotriassic faunas. Seventy taxa, including two new genera and seven new species, are described from Permian rocks of the Park City group. Twenty-one taxa, including one new species, are described from Lower Triassic rocks. A proper interpretation of the magnitude of the local faunal break depends on the accurate dating of both the Permian and the Triassic sequences. Rocks of Park City age are subdivided into two age groups on the basis of bivalve correlations. Age group I, consisting of the basal members of the Park City and Phosphoria formations, is correlated with rocks of Upper Leonardian-Lower Wordian age in the West Texas standard Permian marine section. Age group II, including the remaining nine members of the Park City, Phosphoria, and Shedhorn formations, is correlated with rocks of Upper Wordian-Capitanian age in West Texas. This suggests an upper age limit of Kazanian (Capitanian) for the Park City group and indicates that the youngest Permian marine strata (Tartarian, Ochoan) are not locally represented. The Eotriassic Dinwoody formation is of early Scythian age. The nature of the Permian-Triassic contact indicates that at least locally, weathering and erosion took place and suggests a withdrawal of Permian seas and a period of emergence prior to transgression of the early Eotriassic sea. Generic and specific diversification in the Permian bivalves suggests that major evolutionary changes occurred in normal marine, shallow-water, carbonate facies. Latest Permian and earliest Triassic marine deposits are very restricted over the world and are notable for a general lack of calcareous facies. It seems that a major regression of the seas closed the Permian, which was followed by an early Triassic transgression in all of the known sequences. Perhaps the ecological changes recorded by these events were responsible for the revolutionary paleontological changes at this time rather than a very long time hiatus. Although bivalves are abundant in both the Permian and the Eotriassic faunas, only two species, out of 91 noted in the two local sequences, are closely comparable. Lower Eotriassic rocks contain an impoverished, intermediate fauna, which does not closely resemble younger Triassic faunas. The latter do not become established until the return of normal marine, clastic-free, carbonate facies in later Eotriassic time.

N2  - There are no outdoor, white-bellied house mice, Mus musculus, from southeast Asia to India. Outdoor habitats of this hiatus are occupied by other species of the genus Mus belonging to three subgenera: Pyromys, Rattus-like in its supraorbital ridges and embracing five woodland species; the shrewlike subgenus Coelomys whose five species are isolated on mountain forests; and six or more species of the subgenus Mus found in forest, scrub, grass, and cultivated fields but skipping over the most humid parts of the Malay Archipelago. These species are defined by qualitative differences in the shape of the skull, size, color, proportions, and karyotype. Inside buildings of this same hiatus area occur dark-bellied house mice with ochraceous tints, Mus musculus castaneus and M. m. tytleri. Their peculiar zygomatic plate shows their derivation from white-bellied Mus musculus of eastern Asia.

T1  - Review of ichthyodectiform and other Mesozoic teleost fishes, and the theory and practice of classifying fossils.

N2  - The ichthyodectiform fishes are a nominal order of Mesozoic teleosts that have been assigned to three of the four extant teleostean cohorts in one or another recent work, and whose monophyly and composition have not previously been established. From a detailed anatomical survey, it is concluded that the Ichthyodectiformes is monophyletic, and is characterized by an endoskeletal ethmo-palatine bone (a new term) in the floor of the nasal capsule, and by uroneurals that cover the lateral faces of the preural centra. Ichthyodectiform subgroups are the Allothrissopoidei (new name, Allothrissops, Upper Jurassic, only) and Ichthyodectoidei, the latter containing the Ichthyodectidae (nine nominal genera, Upper Jurassic-Upper Cretaceous) and Saurodontidae (two genera, Cretaceous). The Crossognathidae (two genera, Cretaceous) share the ichthyodectiform uroneural character, but show no other ichthyodectiform features, and have certain synapomorphies with higher teleosts. They are placed as Teleostei incertae sedis. A new scheme of teleostean interrelationships is proposed, in which the Euteleostei and Clupeomorpha are sister-groups, these two combined (Clupeocephala, new usage) are the sister-group of the Elopomorpha, and those two combined (Elopocephala, new usage) are the sister-group of the Osteoglossomorpha. Ichthyodectiforms cannot be assigned to any of these teleostean subgroups. This outline of teleostean relationships is extended by specifying a sequence of derived character states shared by extant Teleostei and the Jurassic forms Tharsis dubius, Leptolepis coryphaenoides, Proleptolepis spp., Pholidolepis dorsetensis, and Pholidophorus bechei. From these character states a corresponding phyletic sequence is inferred such that each named taxon is the sister-group of all those preceding it. Within this scheme, the ichthyodectiforms are the sister-group of Tharsis and extant teleosts. Ichthyodectiform relationships therefore lie between members of the Leptolepididae, as that group is currently defined, making it polyphyletic. Various other Mesozoic teleosts are reviewed, and their relationships specified in this scheme as precisely as the available information permits. One 'leptolepid,' Leptolepides, is the sister-group of extant clupeocephalans. Another, 'Leptolepis' bahiaensis, is a clupeocephalan incertae sedis. 'Leptolepis' macrophthalmus and 'L.' talbragarensis are Teleostei incertae sedis, with relationships in the region of Tharsis and the ichthyodectiforms. The nominal genus Anaethalion contains one Lower Cretaceous elopomorph, 'A.' vidali, and an unnamed Jurassic elopomorph, whereas the remaining species are Elopocephala incertae sedis. The Jurassic 'leptolepid' Ascalabos and the Upper Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous form genus Pachythrissops are Teleostei incertae sedis, in the same way as 'Leptolepis' macrophthalmus. With these and other relationships proposed in a cladogram (fig. 54), possible methods of classifying such extended sister-group systems, including series of fossils in which each is the sister of a group containing extant taxa of high tank, are discussed. To avoid naming taxa of high rank for single paleospecies, and to avoid frequent changes in the names and ranks of extant taxa, a new convention for dealing with fossils is proposed. We recommend that those fossil taxa whose relationships can be inferred be incorporated in the hierarchy of extant taxa simply by listing them in sequence, within the extant taxon of lowest rank to which they belong. A particular list of sequenced fossils is established according to the convention that each listed fossil group is the plesiomorph sister-group of everything beneath it in the taxon. These listed fossil taxa may have names indicative of any rank, whatever rank may have existed by previous convention, but sequenced fossil taxa are always distinguished by the prefix plesion (new term). Within a monophyletic group of extinct species, however, usual sister-group ranking procedures are followed. The use of plesions is a convention or compromise which makes it unnecessary to rank extinct taxa formally in the same hierarchy as extant taxa. Many of the fossils we have investigated are too poorly known for their relationships to be specified unambiguously. These fossil taxa are incertae sedis, at a specified level in the hierarchy. We recommend that the term incertae sedis be restricted to fossils, and discuss the implications of that recommendation.

The bird pars preacetabularis may have been derived for that of the Ornithischia by a movement medially and the building up of a surface ventral to the original process. 4. The saurischian pars preacetabularis passed dorsal to the pubo-ischio-femoralis internus. That of the Ornithischia did so primitively but later picked up a portion of its origin. In the birds the entire origin of the muscle is from the pars preacetabularis, which is now medial to the muscle, in strong contrast to the saurischian process, which is lateral to it.

N2  - The objectives of the present report are (1) to interpret in detail the geology of the Sheep Creek-Snake Creek beds of Sioux County, northwestern Nebraska, which have produced more than 30,000 vertebrate fossil specimens, and (2) to supply precise data for these fossils so that future research will conform to historical data and field observations. An erosional remnant of former high plains, which contains the historic Sheep Creek-Snake Creek beds, has preserved a record of geologic history from early through late Miocene time. A remnant of paleovalley that once contained the streams of the early Miocene Sheep Creek (late Hemingfordian) and the late Miocene Snake Creek formations can be seen in the northwest part of the area. The early Medial Miocene (early Barstovian) Olcott Formation (New), the former Lower Snake Creek beds of Matthew, 1924a, crops out in the classic Sinclair Draw and Olcott Hill area that was explored in the early 1900s. The revised and restricted Snake Creek Formation is divided into three new members: the Medial Miocene Murphy Member (early Clarendonian) on Olcott Hill and in East Pliohippus Draw, the Medial Miocene Laucomer Member (late Clarendonian) on Olcott Hill, and the late Miocene Johnson Member that carries early and late Hemphillian faunas. The present report also deals with the documentary data of early collectors whose numerous synonymous names for some of the 57 quarries has led to the dissipation of faunas.

T1  - Intraspecific variation in, and ontogeny of, Prionotropis woollgari and Prionocyclus wyomingensis.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 86
SP  - 145
N2  - Examination of about 450 specimens of Prionotropis woollgari Meek (? non Mantell) and about 40 of Prionocyclus wyomingensis Meek from various localities in the western interior of the United States proves a high degree of both intraspecific variation and ontogenetic changes in these two ammonite species, often quoted and repeatedly used as index fossils but hardly ever thoroughly studied since their establishment. The interaction of both factors causes an almost bewildering diversity of morphologic aspects, particularly in Prionotropis woollgari. Both species are considered polytypic. The original of Meek's (1876, pl. 7) figure 1a, b, is designated lectotype of the typical Prionotropis woollgari Meek. Six varieties: crassa, intermedia, regularis, tenuicostata, praecox, and alata, the last based on the individual figured by Meek (1876) on plate 6, figure 2, and plate 7, figure 1g, h, are separated from the typical form, with P. branneri Dickerson considered a seventh. In addition to Ammonites percarinatus Hall and Meek, Ammonites graysonensis Shumard is also included in the synonymy of Meek's species. The ontogeny of the forma typica as well as of the six new varieties is closely followed with respect to dimensions, length of body chamber and full size attained, whorl section, ornamentation, and sutures. This study shows that intraspecific variation is largely due to differentiation in speed of development. Particularly interesting are sculptural and sutural ontogenies, the former for the appearance, further development, vanishing, and eventual disappearance of the various elements of ornamentation and for its general trend toward diminishing fineness and density, the latter for the trend of the first lateral lobe to change from trifidity to bifidity (and frequently of the second lateral lobe to change simultaneously from bifidity to trifidity). White's (1880) specimens of Prionocyclus wyomingensis are recognized as being typical of this species of Meek's. Two varieties, elegans, based on Whitfield (1880), and robusta, are separated from the typical form, and two large fragments belonging or closely related to this species are discussed as 'incertae sedis.' The ontogeny is studied along the same lines as in Prionotropis woollgari, with similar results, especially as to sutural development. It can be shown that the change of the first lateral lobe from trifidity to bifidity can be achieved in two different ways (orthogenesis?). As both species are genotypes, the differences between them stand for those between their genera. These differences are discussed and found just sufficient to warrant -- by the standards of present taxonomy -- generic separation. The variety praecox of Prionotropis woollgari, however, is somewhat transitional between both genera. Homeomorphies between Albian Pervinquierinae and certain Upper Cretaceous Prionotropidae are exposed and illustrated by several examples, and an attempt is made to point out some sculptural and sutural differences between both groups.

N2  - Zalobius and Asemobius are redescribed, Nanobius is newly described and their phylogeny and taxonomic position are discussed. One new species, nancyae, is descibed in Zalobius, and serricollis, formerly in Zalobius, is placed in the new genus Nanobius. The four species of the three genera are keyed, described, and illustrated. The current subfamilial assignement of the genera is concluded to be unsatisfactory but the genera share no detected derived characters with other subfamilies that permit reassignment. Cladistic analysis indicates that the two species of Zalobius form the sister group of Asemobius caelatus, that Nanobius serricollis is the sister species of a group containing all three, and that the four species share at least six apomorphic character states. Alternative phylogenetic schemes are discussed. The four species live in the temperate, montane areas of the western United States and Canada.

N2  - One. The phylogeny of 139 out of a total of 142 genera and subgenera of termites based primarily upon the imago-worker mandibles has been studied. 2. The imago-worker mandibles of termites provide a conservative morphological character significant for the study of phylogeny. 3. The families Kalotermitidae and Rhinotermitidae have a relatively fixed mandibular pattern in the imago and worker castes. The Hodotermitidae and the Termitidae exhibit a great variation in the imago-worker mandibles. The variation of this character within a genus is negligible. 4. In the main, this study corroborates the termite classification proposed by Holmgren. In some cases, however, he has misinterpreted the phylogeny because of convergent adaptation. The study of the imago-worker mandibles has cleared some of these errors. 5. The subfamily Serritermitinae, hitherto included under the family Rhinotermitidae, is transferred to the family Termitidae. 6. It is concluded that the Rhinotermitidae arose from a stock which had Archotermopsis-like imago-worker mandibles and possessed ocelli and not from the Kalotermitidae as suggested by Holmgren and Hare. 7. There are several phylogenetic lineages in the Nasutitermitinae, and Holmgren's subgenera are best raised to generic rank. 8. Pseudomicrotermes, whose exact relationship has thus far remained obscure, is now assigned to the subfamily Armitermitinae in which it forms a distinct group with Eremotermes and Synhamitermes. 9. There are several instances of convergence in termite evolution. The phragmotic head in the Kalotermitidae has evolved three times. The nasute soldier in the Nasutitermitinae has arisen twice independently. The evolution of the asymmetrical soldier mandibles in the Termitinae has occurred in two distantly related groups of genera. 10. Zoogeography has been of some help in understanding the phylogenetic relationships of several genera. The distribution of some primitive termites belonging to the families Mastotermitidae and Hodotermitidae conforms to Matthew's theory of distribution of primitive forms. 11. The worker caste, usually considered of little importance in termite taxonomy, can be of great value for generic identification, particularly by the study of its mandibles. 12. A discussion of the concepts of homology, conservative characters, convergence, Dollo's rule of irreversibility of evolution, regressive evolution, and the persistence of genes and gene patterns has been included.

N2  - Natal-down pterylae consist of definitely arranged rows of neossoptiles superimposed on certain presumptive contour-feather pterylae. Neossoptiles are essentially only modified downy tips of certain teleoptile feathers; thus the natal plumage is only a transitory phase of the juvenile plumage. Reduction of the natal plumage is considered to be a product of specialization, but it is here proposed that reduction is a by-product of total embryonic specialization. Complete loss of the natal plumage has occurred independently in some members of several families: Hirundinidae, Corvidae, Chamaeidae, Bombycillidae, Vireonidae, Parulidae, Ploceidae; possibly in Paridae and Sylviidae; and perhaps in others, notably Troglodytidae and Laniidae. Gradual definite reduction has resulted in generally similar natal-down pteryloses in members of any given taxonomic unit. There is some individual variation within the species in natal plumage, usually involving the number of neossoptiles in given tracts, but rarely in the presence or absence of tracts themselves. Because of the fragility of the natal plumage, most variations observed are due to abrasion rather than to genetic differences. Observations on the colors of natal plumages show this character to be the least trustworthy for comparative analysis. Color characteristics vary considerably as a result of fading, soiling, and abrasion. Head-tract down is often darker than down elsewhere. Though post-natal growth of neossoptiles has been credited to some species my measurements seemed to indicate that the natal down completes its elongation before the time of hatching. Post-embryonic down growth might be referable to the Heinroths' 'Pelzdaunenkleid.' The adaptive relationships (if they exist) of down color, distribution, and structure with temperature, illumination, and concealment have yet to be functionally demonstrated. There is admittedly a tendency for over-all reduction or complete disappearance of natal down correlated with enclosed types of nidification. In domestic canaries there is probably a genetic relationship between color of teleoptiles and length of neossoptiles. The distribution of neossoptiles, their number per pteryla, and the length of neossoptiles are amenable to quantitative analysis and thus provide a needed quantitative tool for the delimitation of genera and families and for the interpretation of possible phylogenetic relationships. Deviations in direction and magnitude from the basic pterylological plan of each family should provide a quantitative measure of adaptation. In passerines, the average total number of neossoptiles per species is 130 (151 if we exclude the naked species); the average total aggregate is 945 mm. (1096 mm. if we exclude the naked species) as determined by these data. Tentative familial and generic synopses were prepared with the material at hand. Some of the Tyrannidae had the greatest number of neossoptiles and downy regions found among the passerines, which differentiate that family clearly from all the others. A previously undescribed auricular ring in Sayornis was noted. Three groups of swallows were segregated similarly according to the manner of nesting. Hirundo and Petrochelidon showed allied characters. In the Corvidae there appeared a tendency for parallelism towards nakedness. The genus Baeolophus was indicated as possibly still usefully expressive of relationships in the Paridae. The Sittidae, Paridae, and Certhidae had a comparable degree of down reduction but are no more similar to one another in pattern than they are to the Troglodytidae or Parulidae. Desert wrens and thrashers seem to have relatively greater down aggregates than species from less arid environments. The members of the Mimidae and Turdidae that were examined were characterized generically by natal-down pteryloses. Sturnus vulgaris, with its large quantity of down, presented one of several exceptions to alleged correlations of nudity and cavity nesting. The Vireonidae had down of greater fragility than that of other families. Disparity in neossoptile number and aggregate between Seiurus aurocapillus and S. noveborecensis is thought provacative. The Icteridae and Fringillidae showed many similarities. Molothrus ater, in spite of its social parasitism, retains the typical natal-down pterylosis of its family. Cardueline finches were consistently white downed. In Spizella differences of down aggregate (but not of distribution) from species to species showed interesting amplitude in a currently recognized genus. Statistical treatment of two species showed the positive value of natal pterylosis as a tool in systematics even with small samples. A hypothesis was proposed, that natal-plumage characters are probably not so much selected for as such as they are modified passively by linkage with changing embryonic sequential patterns in evolution. Absence of correlation between length and number of neossoptiles from species to species favored a direct genetic control of neossoptiles rather than a hormonal control. Of the major pterylae the following five neossoptile regions were the most constantly present: rniddorsal, coronal, occipital, scapular, and femoral. Ventral, crural, rectrix, and alar tracts were lost most often in evolution. The more generalized neossoptile pteryloses of a species with an adult ephippial apterium in species with specialized neossoptile pteryloses suggest that the ephippial space is a primitive character in passerines.

T1  - The evolution and systematics of the iguanid genus Uma and its relation to the evolution of other North American desert reptiles.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 114
SP  - 251
N2  - The genus Uma occurs on the Mojave and Sonoran deserts and on the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. 2. The genus is totally restricted to aeolian sand deposits, most of which are of recent origin. 3. Migration of present-day forms of Uma seems entirely limited by movements of occupied sand accumulations. 4. Dominant plant associates of the genus are quite uniform over its entire range. 5. Uma occurs on the most arid portions of the deserts. The genus endures habitat temperature extremes from about 0° F. to over 189° F. (black bulb, within the surface layer of the microclimate). By virtue of morphological and behavioral temperature-control adaptations, a small portion of this thermal range is selected (26° C. to 41° C. approximately) for activity. 6. Surface activity of Uma is often restricted to a small portion of the available daylight hours because of a narrow range of temperature tolerance. 7. The genus is found from 244 feet below sea level to about 3700 feet above sea level. 8. A study of variation within the genus shows: A. Three major levels of differentiation are present. The most aberrant and primitive form is exsul, scoparia is intermediate, and the three subspecies notata notata, notata rufopunctata, and notata inornata form a homogeneous group which is closely related to scoparia. B. Uma n. rufopunctata has been redefined on the basis of measurements, counts, and a distinctive breeding coloration. Its known range has been extended to include the Arizona populations, formerly thought to be part of the range of Uma n. notata. C. The known ranges of all forms have been extended by the discovery of isolated populations. D. Color variations in Uma are numerous. The individuals of nearly every population closely match the sand color of their habitat. E. Intraspecific variation in pattern and scale configuration has been noted within scoparia. 9. The white ventral coloration of many diurnal desert lizards, including Uma, may possibly have been produced by selection towards shadow reduction, background color matching, and temperature control (by reflection of radiated heat from the substratum). 10. Because a fossil record is lacking, any proposed evolutionary history of Uma must be based on environmental, history. The conclusions drawn from this evidence are hypothetical and subject to considerable possible error. 11. The development of most North American desert reptiles appears to be correlated with the development of the Madro-Tertiary Flora. This flora originated in the Oligocene and Miocene in northern Mexico and southwestern United States in genetic response to increasing aridity. 12. Increasing aridity, reaching a climax in middle Pliocene, caused segregation of this flora into a number of vegetative types occupying separate ecological situations. Present desert vegetation has developed from the most xeric of these segregates. 13. Uma apparently arose as an offshoot of an early Callisaurus-Holbrookia-Uma stock as arid habitats developed, possibly in thorn forest or arid, subtropical, scrub associations. 14. It is postulated that the precursor of Uma was split into western and central Mexican populations by extensive volcanism along the axis of the Sierra Madre Occidentál in middle or late Miocene time. 15. Since this separation, parallel evolution due to similar environmental stresses has kept the two groups closely allied morphologically. Middle Pliocene aridity most probably enhanced the development of widespread sand habitats. The pre-Uma of the two regions adapted to aeolian sand and, for the first time, developed the distinctive dune-adapted morphology associated today with the genus Uma. 16. Semi-desert vegetation underwent a widespread development in early and middle Pliocene times. Pre-Uma was probably associated with this vegetation as it developed. Many other desert reptile genera have probably followed a similar path of evolution. 17. Late Pliocene and Pleistocene climactic extremes were such that Uma was restricted from part of its northern range as were other mesic desert reptiles. During the Pleistocene glacial advances, the Great Basin and most of the Mojave Desert were most likely uninhabitable to Uma. 18. Uma scoparia has differentiated in the north, probably as a result of isolation incurred during a pluvial period. 19. Uma notata notata and Uma notata rufopunctata have resulted from division of the Sonoran Desert populations by the rejuvenated Colorado River of Pleistocene time. Gene exchange between the two subspecies may occur intermittently because of shifts in the course of the lower Colorado River. 20. Uma n. inornata has resulted from differentiation north of ancient Lake LeConte which has occupied the lower portions of the Cahuilla Basin during portions of the Ice Age. 21. Uma scoparia has reinvaded a considerable portion of the Mojave Desert since the last Pluvial age. The routes can be followed along stream courses and over low divides by a study of the present distribution of the species and the paths of Pluvial drainage.

N2  - The Traverse group, of middle and late Devonian age, comprises about 600 feet of limestone, argillaceous limestone, and calcareous shale along its belt of outcrop in the northern part of the southern peninsula of Michigan. The abundance and exquisite preservation of the invertebrate fauna make these beds one of the finest collecting grounds for Devonian fossils in North America, and many studies on the corals, mollusks, ostracods, and Bryozoa have been published. The present report begins the systematic study of Traverse brachiopods by an analysis of the superfamilies Dalmanellacea, Pentameracea, Strophomenacea, Orthotetacea, Chonetacea, and Productacea. Twenty-three genera, 98 species, and 11 subspecies are recognized. Fifty-four of the species are new. Five new genera (Sphenophragmus, Orthopleura, Oligorhachis, Helaspis, and Truncalosia) are proposed. Bivariate statistical techniques are employed as a means of characterizing the growth patterns of 70 species and subspecies. Unusually abundant and stratigraphically complete collections of several genera from the lower four formations of the Traverse group in the Thunder Bay region involve continuous variation between extreme morphologic types. This is interpreted as a record of endemic evolution rather than migration. Theoretical difficulties in the compartmentation of a biologic continuum, ordinarily not encountered because of the incomplete nature of the paleontologic record, are here met in fact. Significant differences are noted in the number of species of the genus Strophodonta found in different formations, with a maximum of taxonomic diversity and a minimum of morphologic variation characterizing collections from the Alpena limestone. This relationship is interpreted in terms of adaptive radiation into a diversity of habitats associated with Alpena reefs. Ranges of species in the sections exposed on the shores of Little Traverse Bay and Thunder Bay are established. Faunal evidence documents the correlation of the Gravel Point formation with the Alpena limestone and part of the Four Mile Dam formation and the correlation of the middle Petoskey formation with the Potter Farm formation. Although the proportion of cosmopolitan species is small, identification of Traverse forms in collections from Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Ontario, Missouri, and New York contributes to the regional correlation of Traverse strata.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 123
SP  - 215
N2  - The Southern Alps of New Zealand are a mountain range that forms the backbone of the South Island of New Zealand. The range extends in a northeast to southwest direction from about latitude 42 S. to latitude 45 S. and is continued both north and south by subsidiary ranges; it is bounded on the west by the Alpine Fault. Most of the rocks are graywackes and argillites and their metamorphosed equivalents. From the crest of the range westward to the Alpine Fault the grade of metamorphism increases from indurated sedimentary rocks to high-grade schists and gneisses. Four zones of progressive metamorphism are recognized: the Chlorite, Biotite, Almandine, and Oligoclase zones. The mineralogy and petrology of these zones are described and illustrated by analyses of their rocks and their constituent minerals. The sediments were deposited in a geosyncline in Triassic (and possible Permian and Jurassic) times. An early Cretaceous orogeny resulted in intense folding, followed by regional metamorphism. Erosion reduced the region to a low level by the end of the Cretaceous, and much of it was subjected to a marine transgression in early Tertiary times. Renewed uplift began in the Miocene and reached its peak in strong vertical movements on the Alpine Fault at the end of the Tertiary period.

T1  - Comparative studies in the light sensitivity of blind characins from a series of Mexican caves.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 89
SP  - 323
N2  - One. Five caves in a Mexican valley in the state of San Luis Potosi contain related blind characins differing slightly in morphology and reactivity to light. 2. The deriving river form and the blind cave forms still somewhat pigmented near the river connection are light negative, while the unpigmented are light positive. 3. The unpigmented forms in the cave nearest the river became light negative after having been kept in light for a time, concomitantly developing a heavy layer of guanine, and some of those from the next cave in a similar manner developed melanophores, while those from the remaining three caves showed no such changes in behavior or pigmentation following exposure to light. 4. The phototaxis exhibited, either positive or negative, is mediated through the remnant optic cyst, since both types become light indifferent on removal of the cysts. However, some fish in all the more advanced populations are light indifferent and have no nervous connection between the cyst and the brain. 5. The sign of the phototaxis is determined by whether the pineal complex is exposed to light or not, the fish in which it is exposed being light positive. Thus with the elimination of pigmentation and the reduction of other overlying tissues, these fishes, in an evolutionary sense, pass from a condition of being light negative to that of being light positive. 6. The sign of the light reaction may be reversed experimentally by covering the normally exposed pineal area or exposing the normally covered area in the two types of fishes. 7. Hybrids between light positive and light negative fishes are found to be intermediate in morphology and reactivity to light. 8. All these fishes have a secondary 'pineal opening,' which is well covered with pigment and guanine in the river fish and the less advanced cave forms. However, these structures are progressively reduced in the more advanced cave forms, thus accounting for the exposed area. 9. Genetic and morphologic data suggest that these populations worked up the now dry valley under ground and did not simply 'sink' into the ground from local surface populations when the caves were formed to develop independent but parallel blind fish populations. 10. The survival value of a light negative reaction of blind fishes near a cave outlet is obvious, and it would appear that the reversal of sign in the more advanced forms can be tolerated only because it occurs in caves too remote from surface outlets to permit the fishes from draining out into an unsuitable lighted environment.

T1  - Oceanographic observations in the Panama Bight, "Askoy" Expedition, 1941.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 118
SP  - 117
N2  - The Panama Bight may be defined as that part of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean that lies between the Isthmus of Panama (about latitude 9° N.) and Punta Santa Elena (about latitude 2° S.) and extends westward from the coasts of Panama, Colombia, and Ecuador to about longitude 81° W. Oceanographic observations discussed in this region were made by the 'Askoy' expedition during the period February 9 to May 26, 1941. Bathymetrically the region is part of the Panama Basin which is enclosed by Central and South America, Cocos Ridge, the Galapagos Islands, and Carnegie Ridge. Most of the Panama Bight is deeper than 3000 meters, the shelf being nowhere wider than 30 miles except in the Gulf of Panama which is less than 200 meters deep. Seasonal contrasts in weather within the Bight are related to movement of the Intertropical Convergence. In January-March the Intertropical Convergence is farthest south, offshore northerlies cause upwelling in the Gulf of Panama, and the Gulf experiences its dry season. In July-September the Intertropical Convergence is farthest north, and the region south of Cabo de San Francisco receives its least rain. The central part of the Bight receives heavy rainfall throughout the year. From June to November most of the Panama Bight is dominated by southwest winds. These seasonal changes are reflected in the average surface distribution of temperature and salinity. In February surface temperatures of 26° to 28° C. and salinities of 34 to 35 parts per mille are found in most parts of the Bight, with lower temperatures in the Gulf of Panama. By August low surface temperatures have disappeared in the Gulf, and the whole region is covered with surface waters of low salinity (less than 33°‰). It is estimated that during the rainiest period the salinity of a 10-meter layer of water 300 miles long and 60 miles wide could be reduced by rainfall and runoff from 33 parts per mille to 28 parts per mille in a period of two to three months. During the 'Askoy' expedition, surface temperatures of 26° to 28° C. and surface salinities of somewhat less than 34 parts per mille were observed in most of the region. These high surface temperatures and relatively low surface salinities were characteristic of only a rather thin surface layer (reaching 25 meters or less) which was underlain by a shallow pycnocline. At 100 meters temperatures range from 15.8° to 19.5° C., salinities from 34.87 parts per mille to 35.05 parts per mille. In the Gulf of Panama high surface temperatures, low surface salinities, and the presence of a strong shallow pycnocline suggest that upwelling in early 1941 was less intense than usual. This was confirmed by comparison with 'Hannibal' observations in March, 1933, and by examination of long-term measurements of sea level and surface temperature at Balboa by the Panama Canal Company. Correlation of a northerly wind-stress index for February-March with the average sea level for the same months over a 42-year period gave the significant correlation coefficient of -0.54. However, although the 1941 northerly wind-stress index was somewhat lower than average, it was not low enough to account for the unusually high sea level observed in 1941. Thus it seems likely that some other large-scale process affecting sea temperatures over a large area was operating. During the first half of 1941 El Niño was observed off the coast of northern Peru. Schott's explanation of this phenomenon, based on its characteristics in 1891 and 1925, calls for a cold tongue extending from the Gulf of Panama nearly to the equator. Although this cold tongue was not detected by the 'Askoy,' unusually high temperature, low salinity, and a strong southward surface current measured west of Malpelo Island may be related to the influx of northern waters on the coast of Peru. Observation of a pronounced subsurface temperature discontinuity 200 miles west of Buenaventura, accompanied by other indications at the surface, suggests that a well-developed oceanic front was present on March 24, 1941. Examination of average surface current charts shows a northward coastal surface flow north of Cabo de San Francisco throughout the year, with a mean speed of about 25 cm. per second (0.5 knot) and a width of less than 100 miles. 'Askoy' measurements in the northern part of the Bight show a subsurface distribution of mass consistent with such a current which appears to be the eastern limb of the general counterclockwise circulation in the Panama Bight. It is proposed that it be called the 'Colombia Current'.

T1  - Relationships among the living squirrels of the Sciurinae.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 118
SP  - 157
N2  - Discovery of a character of the skull that appeared to sort some of the squirrels of the subfamily Sciurinae into the tribes into which they had previously been assignable only on the basis of genital characters resulted in a search for other skull characters for a testing of the existing sciurine classification. Three of the six subfamilies proposed by Pocock (1923) and scaled down to tribes by Simpson (1945), namely, the Xerini, the Tamiasciurini, and the Marmotini, are here shown to be distinguishable by skull characters. The tribes Sciurini and Callosciurini, which possess the most consistently distinctive characters of the baculum (os penis), are accepted as valid tribes on those characters alone. These last two are found to be constituted by three and two phyla, respectively, which are distinguished by characters of the skull and which are recognized as subtribes. The sixth tribe, the Funambulini, is shown by skull characters to consist of three distinct phyla. The tribe Funambulini as restricted is accepted, and two phyla are here raised to tribal rank, the Protoxerini and the Ratufini. Eleven phyla, six of them tribes and five the subtribes of the Sciurini and the Callosciurini, are defined and diagnosed by means of skull characters in considerable detail. Their possible relationships are discussed on the basis of such definitions and diagnoses and other available information. A key to the tribes and subtribes based on characters of the skull is offered, and many genera are for the first time given an adequate diagnosis on characters of the skull. A classification of the Sciurinae is offered which integrates as closely as possible the findings of the present study with what seems validated of earlier work. This consists of eight tribes, 11 subtribes, and 37 genera. Because the problem of whether or not the pygmy squirrels constitute a monophyletic unit had never been adequately treated, the skull character evidence for and against such a concept is here marshalled, considered, and concluded to be strongly against. The pygmy squirrel likenesses apparently represent convergence. An enumeration and comparison of the taxonomic skull characters of the genera of Sciurinae reveal indications of great conservatism in genera occupying the typical tree squirrel niche, and perhaps a basic ground squirrel niche and a long-nosed squirrel niche, whereas genera occupying other sciurine niches appear to have had greater freedom to acquire skull character specializations. The South American genus Sciurillus is thought to be too highly differentiated to have originated in South America, because an isthmus made that continent available to squirrels in the late Pliocene. It is suggested that it evolved in a tropical southern extremity of North America before an isthmus arose.

T1  - Species limits in the woodpecker genus Centurus (Aves).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 124
SP  - 217
N2  - This study is concerned with the systematic relationships among certain populations of woodpeckers of the genus Centurus occurring in the United States, México, and Central America. Significant conclusions arising from this investigation, which has involved field work in México in 1958 and examination of large numbers of museum specimens, are as follows: The generic name Tripsurus is regarded as a synonym of Centurus, since there is no known character or combination of characters that distinguishes species currently assigned to these two nominal genera. Moreover, one species, chrysogenys, that is invariably assigned to Centurus is actually more closely related to species currently assigned to Tripsurus. Centurus (sensu lato) is closely allied with, and possibly inseparable from, Melanerpes. Quantitative analysis of morphologic characters of specimens that represent populations of the aurifrons complex fully supports the view of Ridgway (1881) and Griscom (1932) that these populations belong to a single, highly polytypic species, since even the most strongly differentiated forms (C. a. aurifrons and C. a. dubius) intergrade in zones of contact. It is advocated that the number of subspecies for continental populations be limited to five; these are C. a. aurifrons (including C. a. incanescens of recent classifications), C. a. dubius (including C. a. leei of Cozumel Island, Yucatán), C. a. grateloupensis (including C. a. veraecrucis), C. a. santacruzi (including C. a. pauper and C. a. fumosus), and C. a. polygrammus (including C. a. frontalis). The color and pattern of the plumage in Centurus species are presumably cryptic, and geographic variation in these characters shows a reasonably close correlation with regional variation in climate and vegetation type. The brightly colored, sexually dimorphic areas of the head (and perhaps also the brightly colored belly region) presumably have epigamic significance. It is probable that Centurus hoffmanni of Costa Rica and Nicaragua is specifically distinct from C. aurifrons. Field work in restricted zones of sympatry between Centurus aurifrons and C. uropygialis in Aguascalientes and Jalisco indicates that the two forms are specifically distinct. Approximately 5 per cent of the specimens taken in the zones of sympatry show evidence of hybrid origin, but gene exchange between the two forms is not extensive, if in fact it occurs at all. The presence of traces of yellow pigment on the nape of specimens of C. uropygialis throughout its range is interpreted not as evidence of present-day introgression of genes from C. aurifrons but as a vestige of a character more fully developed in a population ancestral to C. uropygialis and currently being lost in that species. A specific relationship of Centurus aurifrons and C. carolinus is demonstrated by their sympatry without interbreeding in a narrow zone in Texas. Contrary to the suggestion of Peters (1948), Centurus hypopolius is probably not conspecific with C. uropygialis, and it may be more closely allied to C. chrysogenys, with which it is sympatric in Puebla and Morelos. The Haitian woodpecker, Chryserpes striatus, which has been assigned to Centurus by Bond and others, is not closely allied to any species of Centurus or Melanerpes and should be placed in the monotypic genus Chryserpes, as advocated by W.D. Miller, pending further study of its relationships. The significance of ecologic range or amplitude in distribution and speciation in birds is discussed. For Centurus it is suggested that the evolution of reproductive isolating mechanisms tends to proceed more rapidly than does the evolution of ecologic isolation, with the result that competition and other interspecific interactions prevent extensive sympatry of closely related species of the genus. The possible ecologic significance of increased degrees of sexual dimorphism in size, particularly in bill length, in certain insular woodpeckers is discussed, but, in the absence of comparative ecologic and behavioral studies, no satisfactory explanation of the phenomenon can be given.

T1  - The terapon perches (Percoidei, Teraponidae) : a cladistic analysis and taxonomic revision.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 159
SP  - 177
N2  - The family Teraponidae was revised to determine: the monophyletic nature of the family; the relationships of teraponids to other perciform fishes; the relationships within the family; the recognizable species and their distinguishing characters; and the distribution patterns of the family and its subunits. Using methods of phylogenetic and biogeographic analysis put forward by Hennig and Croizat, respectively, I obtained the following results: (1) The Teraponidae can be defined on the basis of derived states of the swimbaldder, extrinsic swimbladder muscle, urohyal, and third pharyngobranchial. These characters fail to support the inclusion of the genera Datnioides and Pseudohelotes in the Teraponidae as suggested by Fowler. Neither these characters nor any others were found to support a hypothesis of a sister-group relationship between teraponids and any other group in the Percoidei. (2) Within the family 15 monophyletic assemblages were recognized, with the relationships between them and their defining characters based on derived states of posttemporal, tabular, dentary, maxillary, premaxillary, spinous dorsal, and vertebral osteology; forms of the extrinsic swimbladder muscle; swimbladder and intestinal patterns; and differences in pigmentation and heights of the dorsal and anal fin sheaths. (3) These monophyletic assemblages are recognized at the generic level; and three new genera (Hannia, Lagusia, and Syncomistes) are described. Thirty-seven species are recognized of which five (Leiopotherapon macrolepis, Hannia greenwayi, Syncomistes butleri, Syncomistes trigonicus, and Syncomistes kimberleyensis) are described for the first time. Each species is described in detail and a key is provided to the species of the family. Eight species recognized as distinct by some or all workers to this point are placed in synonymy, one species synonymized previously is recognized as distinct, and the previous synonymizations of two nominal forms are tentatively modified. (4) Track analysis of the zoogeography of the family and its subunits revealed two major patterns: a track including the coastal regions of the entire Indo-west Pacific and a track between the fresh waters of northern Australia and southern New Guinea. The significance of these tracks in light of various geological events in the region is discussed.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 160
SP  - 195
N2  - The genus Sabulodes is revised for the first time, and Phengommataea Hulst is placed in its synonymy. The genus is redescribed and divided into four groups; the latter are defined primarily on the basis of male genitalia and secondary sexual characters. Keys are given to the species, based on male and female genitalia. All species are described, and both the adults and their genitalia are illustrated; distributional data are given for all species. The following are described as new: Sabulodes caberata oberthuri (Ecuador), plauta (Mexico), solola (Guatemala), wygodzinskyi (Colombia), setosa (Mexico), mucronis (Jamaica), laticlavia (Cuba), curta (Puerto Rico), striata (Guyana), triangula (Brazil), loba (Mexico), depile (Bolivia), pumilla (Guatemala), and huachuca (United States: Arizona). A large number of Neotropical species have been placed in Sabulodes, but the great majority do not belong in the genus. The 36 included psecies are distributed from southwestern Canada (British Columbia) and the western United States, south to southern South America and the Greater Antilles. They appear to be absent from the Lesser Antilles, Trinidad, the lower Amazonian basin, northeastern Brazil, and Chile. At least two species in the genus are commercial pests; these are aegrotata Guenée in california, and caberata Guenée in Brazil.

T1  - The Jurassic turtles of North America.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 162
SP  - 93
N2  - There are two valid turtle taxa from the North American late Jurassic Morrison Formation: Glyptops plicatulus, distinguished by a fine, pustulose shell ornamentation, last vertebral scute partially dividing the last pair of marginal scutes, and a smoothly convex anterior margin of the plastron; and Dinochelys whitei, new genus and species, distinguished by a smooth shell surface, last vertebral scute not dividing the last pair of marginal scutes, and an anterior plastral margin with lobes formed by the gular and intergular scutes. presumed juveniles of Glyptops and Dinochelys suggest that prominent carapacial ridges characterize juveniles of these two taxa and that the ridges are lost in adults. Probaena sculpta Hay is considered a nomen dubium because it is an unidentifiable juvenile, presumably of Glyptops or Dinochelys. Taxa previously referred to Glyptops but here considered indeterminant are: 'Glyptops' pervicax, 'Glyptops' belviderensis, 'Glyptops' caelatus, 'Glyptops' depressus, and 'Glyptops' ruetimeyeri. Dinochelys is placed Cryptodira incertae sedis because the higher systematics of cryptodires is based on skull morphology and the skull is lacking in this form. A cranial study of Glyptops suggests that it and Mesochelys form a monophyletic group, the Glyptopsidae, that is characterized by one derived character: the basisphenoid extends the length of, and completely separates, the pterygoids. I follow Evans and Kemp's (1976) suggestion that the Baenoidea of Gaffney (1972 and 1975) is not monophyletic and that the Glyptopsidae is the sister group of the remaining cryptodires. Baenidae and Eucryptodira would form a monophyletic group sharing the derived character: posterior temporal emargination separating or nearly separating parietal and squamosal.

T1  - A generic revision of the Protolabidini (Mammalia, Camelidae) with a description of two new protolabidines.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 161
SP  - 369
N2  - A revised diagnosis of the Protolabidini characterizes the tribe as having a narrow rostrum and laterally expanded anterior nares. Tanymykter, new genus, possess the above derived features and is included in the Protolabidini as the primitive sister taxon to Protolabis. The morphological features that separate Tanymykter from Protolabis are all primitive except for the derived condition of closely appressed P[superscript]1[subscript]1 roots. Based upon new material from the Milk Creek Formation, morphological distinctions between Protolabis and Procamelus are clarified. The principal derived features of Protolabis coartatus that differ from Procamelus are extreme constriction of the rostrum, lateral expansion of the anterior nares, P[subscript]1 and P[subscript]2 small and sometimes absent, and a mandibular angle with extreme lateral flare and a prominent mesial tuberosity. Although the above derived features are less pronounced, they are still present in Protolabis heterodontus and other undescribed samples in the collection of the American Museum of Natural History. Thus, Stirton's species, coartatus, which has previously confused the generic concept of Procamelus, is transferred to Protolabis. The small size of the cranium and coronoid process is correlated with the strong lateral and mesial flare of the mandibular angle in P. coartatus. This reflects increased emphasis on the masseter and pterygoid muscles in mastication and less emphasis on the temporalis. In contrast, the large coronoid process in Procamelus indicates greater emphasis on the temporalis muscle. Oxydactylus exilis Matthew is transferred to Michenia because it shares the derived features of a narrow rostrum, incisiform upper canine, and a shallow symphysis. A new species, Michenia yavapaiensis, with P[subscript]1 unerupted, P[subscript]2 small, unerupted or absent, and tall-crowned molars is described from the Milk Creek Formation. Finally, a cladogram of proposed relationships of the Protolabidini is presented, including Tanymykter, new genus, Protolabis and Michenia with supporting evidence for this tribe being a monophyletic group. The relationship of other members of the Camelinae to the Protolabidini is also discussed. A short section detailing the stratigraphic framework of the Milk Creek Formation, Yavapai County, Arizona is included.

T1  - The biology of blister beetles of the vittata group of the genus Epicauta (Coleoptera, Meloidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 162

N2  - The vittata group of the genus Epicauta contains 31 species. Seven of these are confined to North America; one ranges from Central America to central South America; the rest are confined to South America. All the species from North America (Epicauta vittata, E. occidentalis, E. temexa, E. abadona, E. tamara, E. vitticollis, and E. unilineata) and three of those from southern South America (Epicauta monachica, E. luteolineata, and E. leopardina) are compared in detail with respect to ecology, behavior, and reproductive biology (courtship, copulation, oviposition, and development and hatching of eggs). Field and laboratory studies establish a high degree of uniformity among the species of the group in all characters except those of male courtship behavior. Differences in courtship behavior are especially marked between sympatric species. Little of the variation among taxa in biological characters is explicable on the basis of variation in the physical environment of the taxa. The group is formally defined and a diagnostic key to the species occurring in North America is presented. Species accounts giving synonymy, locality records, and (for the North American species) analyses of geographic variation are presented. New species in the group are Epicauta temexa, E. tamara, E. aragua, and E. apure. Epicauta kraussi var. purpureiceps is given species status as Epicauta purpureiceps.

T1  - The distribution of birds in Venezuelan páramos.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 162
SP  - 49
N2  - Páramos are insular in distribution and thus of interest to biogeographers. In the present paper new data are given on geographical distribution, ecological preferences, relative abundance, general behavior, and breeding of 47 species of birds studied on nine Venezuelan páramos in March-April 1975. Some data obtained in March 1968 and in May 1970 are also included. Páramo vegetation is defined as the open formation growing above the upper limit of continuous montane forest in the Andes of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and northern Perú. This vegetation consists of grasses, herbs, low shrubs, cushion and rosette plants. Polylepis woodlands constitute true islands of a vegetation type distinct from, but growing within, páramo vegetation. A páramo species is a bird inhabiting one of six ecological categories distinguished within the páramo vegetation. The result of six censuses, carried out at altitudes from 3100 m. to 4430 m. suggest that bird species are unevenly distributed altitudinally in Venezuelan páramos. The way birds utilize four major features of the páramo (Espeletia spp., shrubs, water, and barren ground) is discussed. Geographical patchiness in birds of Venezuelan páramos is analyzed in terms of six variables: (1) incomplete sampling; (2) differences in dispersal ability; (3) lack of suitable ecological requirements; (4) exclusion by interspecific competition; (5) historical reasons associated with human modifications of habitats; and (6) historical reasons associated with Pleistocene fluctuations of climate and vegetation. Three major source areas can be postulated for colonization of páramos (North and Central America, adjacent areas of northern South America, and southern South America). Several species may have colonized the páramos of Venezuela from two or three source areas.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 161
SP  - 429
N2  - I have spent more than 10 years in the field and in museum study in revising the South American species of the genus Myiarchus, the largest genus in the avian family Tyrannidae and one that has given systematists great difficulty. Specific limits and distributions are defined. An analysis of geographical variation provides a consistent basis for the recognition of subspecies. Four monotypic species (venezuelensis, apicalis, semirufus, and magnirostris) and seven polytypic species (tuberculifer, swainsoni, phaeocephalus, cephalotes, panamensis, ferox, and tyrannulus), with 20 subspecies, are admitted. No new forms are described. Diagnoses and keys are based on morphological and vocal characters. Data on vocal repertoires, breeding, and the timing of the annual cycle are summarized for each species. Special attention is given to documenting cavity-nesting behavior and the nature of the nest lining, as these behavior patterns help to diagnose the genus. Standardized playback of sound recordings and the resulting responses of territorial birds are used to assess the biological significance of differences in vocal characters, particularly in critical studies of allopatric populations. The sequence followed in the presentation of species accounts represents relationships suggested by an analysis of vocal and morphological characters, but the identification of primitive and derived character states must await a comprehensive examination of other genera of tyrannids presumed to be the closest relatives of Myiarchus.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 162
SP  - 269
N2  - Continuing studies of the fish fauna of the karst regions of Guatemala along the northern foothills of the sierras have revealed the presence of about two dozen species in thirteen genera and nine families in isolated basins with subterranean outlets. Eleven to thirteen of these species, mostly fishes of the family Poeciliidae, are endemic to the isolated basins; five have been described previously. Among poeciliid fishes, members of the genera Heterandria and Xiphophorus are best represented in the karst regions. Because of similarities in their geography the two genera are reviewed together: nine species of Heterandria are recognized, of which six are new (H. attenuata, H. litoperas, H. obliqua, H. anzuetoi, H. cataractae, H. dirempta); 15 species of Xiphophorus are recognized, of which none is new, although numerous taxa previously recognized as subspecies are treated here as species. Taxonomic decisions concerning recognized species of Xiphophorus are based on a reconsideration of various current species concepts from which it is concluded that the 'biological species' should be rejected as a conceptual tool and the 'subspecies' as a methodological one. Earlier taxonomic accounts of Heterandria and Xiphophorus by the author are found to be unacceptable because they were not rigorously and explicitly based on a search for shared derived characters (synapomorphies). Many of the subgroups recognized in those prior accounts are grade groups based merely on the failure of the included taxa to possess the derived defining characters of other subgroups, therefore suggesting, that they were, in fact defined unacceptably by shared primitive characters (symplesiomorphies). As newly revised on the basis of proposed synapomorphy schemes, and the derivative cladograms of relationship, various members of Heterandria and Xiphophorus are shown to possess a number of cladistic similarities in relation to geography: 1. Mexican and Central American species together form a natural group separated from their sister group to the north by a gap, the southern boundary of which is somewhat to the north of Tampico, Mexico. 2. In Middle America the sister group of a group including many southern Mexican and Central American species is in the region around Tampico. 3. A relatively plesiomorphic species occupies two separate isolated karst basins along the western foothills of the sierras in Guatemala. 4. Less plesiomorphic forms occupy the two southernmost Guatemalan rivers that drain into the Gulf of Honduras as well as Atlantic coastal drainages of Honduras. 5. The most apomorphous sister pair of species includes a widespread species that extends along coastal regions of southern Mexico and parts of the Yucatan Peninsula and a species that is confined to an easterly karst basin. 6. Putative hybrids are present between the distributions of the westerly karst species and the widespread form. A discussion of cladistic theory in relation to hybridization suggests how the cladistic interrelationships of putative parents can resolve whether or not intergradation between species in nature is to be considered secondary (i.e., due to the effects of hybridization). The geographic similarities between Heterandria and Xiphophorus are compared by converting their cladograms of taxa into cladograms of areas. In terms of probability theory, it is concluded that the congruence of their area cladograms at a very high confidence level indicates that the two genera shared, in part, a common history in Middle America.

T1  - Revision of the Triatominae (Hemiptera, Reduviidae), and their significance as vectors of Chagas' disease.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 163
SP  - 125
N2  - The reduviid subfamily Triatominae contains numerous species which are actual or potential vectors of Chagas' disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. All Triatominae require bloodmeals for their complete development. Most species feed on small terrestrial or arboreal mammals, especially didelphids, edentates, and rodents; others are associated with bats, and some are found with birds. Several triatomines have colonized human habitations, where they transmit Chagas' disease to man and his domestic animals. The epidemiologically most important species are the wide-ranging Triatoma infestans, T. dimidiata, and Rhodnius prolixus. The following are also active vectors of Chagas' disease, although more localized: Triatoma barberi, brasiliensis, carrioni, guasayana, maculata, patagonica, pallidipennis, phyllosoma, pseudomaculata, rubrofasciata, sordida, and rubida, Panstrongylus chinai, megistus, and rufotuberculatus, Rhodnius ecuadoriensis, and pallescens. A survey of the external structures of the Triatominae and their terminology is presented to facilitate use of the keys and comprehension of the descriptions. The Triatominae share a derived character not found in other reduviids, viz., a membranous connection between the second and third rostral segments. This structure permits an extensive flexure of the third segment, in connection with the act of bloodsucking. The trichobothria of the second antennal segment of the adult are described for the first time; their number and arrangement are diagnostic on the tribal and in some cases generic level. Trichobothria were also discovered on the anterior femora of Cavernicola pilosa. Another previously unknown structure is the presence of a pair of flasklike invaginations on the terminal rostral segment of Dipetalogaster maximus. The shape of the stridulatory sulcus of the prosternum is shown to be, in some cases, diagnostic on the generic level. Some Triatominae have adopted strategies that allow them to expand their abdomen for the ingestion of unusually large bloodmeals; three such strategies, involving membranization of part of the connexivum and correlated modifications of the lateral part of the abdomen, are described. The male genitalia of plesiomorphic triatomines are of simple structure, but derived forms are shown to have variously specialized phalli, involving modifications of the articulatory apparatus, the basal plate struts, and the dorsal phallosoma plate. First and fifth instar nymphs are studied morphologically, mainly on the generic level. A newly discovered character of first instar nymphs is the absence or presence of a group of elongate sensory hairs on the metatarsus. Nymphs of all instars of Microtriatoma and Parabelminus have three pairs of spongy fossulae as do the adults, a condition unique in the subfamily. The subfamily Triatominae is restricted to the Nearctic, Neotropical, and Oriental regions, entering the Australian region marginally. Triatoma rubrofasciata is tropicopolitan. There are 13 genera in the Western Hemisphere, with the center of diversity in South America. The Oriental region contains one endemic genus and an apparently monophyletic species group of Triatoma, a genus occupying the entire range of the subfamily. The division of the Triatominae into five tribes is maintained. One tribe, the Triatomini, is paraphyletic; the Rhodniini, Cavernicolini, Bolboderini, and Alberproseniini are either monophyletic or monotypic. The five tribes, 14 genera, and 111 species are described or redescribed and illustrated and their synonyms given; host relations and epidemiological role are stated where known. Keys for tribal, generic, and specific identification of adults as well as for generic identification of first and fifth instar nymphs are given in English, and, where pertinent, in Spanish and/or Portuguese. Six new species are described: Triatoma guazu (Paraguay); Linshcosteus chota and kali (India), Belminus herreri (Panama), Parabelminus yurupucu (Brazil: Bahia), and Microtriatoma borbai (Brazil: Parana). Nine names are newly synonymized: Triatoma ninoi Carcavallo et al. with T. eratyrusiformis Del Ponte; T. pessoai Sherlock and Serafim and T. bahiensis Sherlock and Serafim, both with T. lenti Sherlock and Serafim; T. novaeguineae Miller with T. leopoldi (Schouteden); T. pallidula Miller with T. migrans Breddin; T. phyllosoma usingeri Mazzotti with T. pallidipennis (Stal); T. bruchi Mazza and Jörg with T. rubrovaria (Blanchard); T. garciabesi Carcavallo et al. with T. sordida (Steal); Rhodnius amazonicus Almeida et al. with R. pictipes Stal.

T1  - A dangerously toxic new frog (Phyllobates) used by Emberá Indians of western Colombia, with discussion of blowgun fabrication and dart poisoning.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 161
SP  - 309
N2  - Phyllobates terribilis, a remarkably toxic new species of frog, is described from the vicinity of an Emberá Chocó settlement in lowland rain forest of Pacific coastal Colombia. It is the third frog definitely known to be used for poisoning darts; the other species are P. aurotaenia and P. bicolor. Toxicity of the skin secretions of Phyllobates, and frog-poisoned darts, is due primarily to batrachotoxin and homobatrachotoxin, steroidal alkaloids that are stronger than curare mixtures. Phyllobates terribilis produces relatively massive quantities of these compounds and is at least twentyfold more toxic than other poison-dart frogs. The new species is potentially dangerous to handle: One freshly caught frog may contain up to 1900 micrograms ... of toxins, only a fraction of which would be lethal to man if enough skin secretion came into contact with an open wound. A human lethal dose is indirectly judged as being somewhere in the range of 2-200 [micrograms], and the secretions also are irritating to porous skin and poisonous if ingested. Phyllobates terribilis attains a snout-vent length of about 47 mm., making it one of the largest species in its family (Dendrobatidae). It is readily distinguished from all other dendrobatids in that body and limbs are a uniform golden or pale metallic green color above and below, except that small juveniles have a primitive pattern of golden dorsolateral stripes on a black ground. The ontogenetic color change, tadpoles, and other aspects of the life history and behavior are described. A component of aggressive grappling behavior of this and some other dendrobatids is suggested as being homologous with dendrobatid cephalic amplexus, an instance of which is photographically documented for Dendrobates tricolor. The trill call of Phyllobates is the third class of dendrobatid vocalizations to be defined. At the type locality, Phyllobates terribilis occurs in populations of predominantly adult frogs that probably have relatively long (> 5 years) and secure lives; reproductive success or juvenile survivorship might be inversely correlated with population density. Emberá Indians are occasional predators, and the snake Leimadophis epinephelus is identified as a potential predator, at least of young frogs. This snake has an unusual capacity for tolerating a great chemical diversity of anuran skin secretions. Piperidine-based skin alkaloids provide a shared, uniquely derived character (synapomorphy), seeming to establish that frogs of the Dendrobates-Phyllobates complex share a monophyletic origin apart from a sister group (Colostethus). But, in the Phyllobates bicolor group, primitive piperidine alkaloids have been largely replaced by a more effective set of defensive skin toxins--the steroidal batrachotoxins. The latter are a novel synapomorphy that seems to establish the monophyly of Phyllobates (sensu stricto), a genus heretofore inadequately defined on the basis of shared primitive (simplesiomorphic) characters. Most of the species recently assigned to Phyllobates (by Silverstone, 1976) are here removed to Dendrobates, including the nomenclatural type species (trivittatus) on which the name Dendrobates must be based. Dendrobates is more diverse as now defined (vs. Silverstone, 1975). The diversity is due to a mixture of shared primitive characters, along with derived characters still to be tested for convergence or parallelism. These changes have minimal effect on the usefulness of Silverstone's (1975, 1976) monographs on the two genera, since his accounts of species and species groups are mostly well considered. The laborious process of fabricating an Emberá Chocó blowgun, quiver, and darts is described and photographically illustrated. The Chocó blowgun is of Yde's type IV, two long and tapering, semi-cylindrical sections of palm wood glued together and wrapped with bast. There are two principal ways of making the bore in type-IV blowguns. Some tribes (Jívaro and Yagua) scratch initial grooves on the half-shafts, which are then joined and the bore enlarged and smoothed with a ramrod and sand. The Chocó and Cofán finish the grooves before the half-shafts are joined; use of metal implements by present-day Chocó and Cofán probably is a simple improvement over such objects as mammal teeth, said to have been used for the same purpose by Pasé Indians over a century ago. The Chocó weapon differs from most other type-IV blowguns in lacking a separate mouthpiece and in rarely being water-proofed. The blowgun is for hunting, but, unlike some Amazonian tribes, the Chocó may have no superstitious strictures against turning it occasionally on man. The Chocó are the only Indians known with certainty to use frog toxins as the sole ingredient of dart poison, and the practice is documented only in the Río San Juan and Río Saija drainages of western Colombia; use of a plant poison is more widespread, although the Chocó blowgun iss on the decline and absent in some areas. The Emberá Chocó and Noanamá Chocó have two ways of obtaining frog poison: frogs of the species Phyllobates aurotaenia and P. bicolor (San Juan drainage) are impaled on a special stick entering the mouth and exiting through a hind leg; the spitted frog may sometimes, but not necessarily, be held near fire while darts are rubbed in its skin secretions. In contrast, dart tips are simply rubbed against the backs of living Phyllobates terribilis (Saija region). These different methods reflect more on the relative toxicity and abundance of the frogs than on cultural differences.

T1  - The ecology and migrations of sea turtles. 7, The West Caribbean green turtle colony.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 162
SP  - 1
N2  - The present report is a summary and preliminary analysis of data on the green turtle, Chelonia mydas, that has been collected during a 22-year tagging program at Tortuguero, Costa Rica, 52 miles north of the Caribbean city of Puerto Limon. It is the first general account of Tortuguero results since 1960. From 1955 through the 1976 season, approximately 12,000 female green turtles have been tagged on the nesting beach. Of these, 2522 have been seen in subsequent years; 1412 of them as return migrants and 1110 on distant forage grounds or in migration. No turtle tagged at Tortuguero has ever been reported from any other nesting shore. The paper is concerned mainly with the migratory and behavioral ecology of the colony and with interseasonal changes in the nesting population. Results are presented in five sections, as follows: (1) Migratory geography and speed of travel: of 1110 long-distance, postseasonal recoveries of Tortuguero tags 957 have come from the Miskito Cays and adjacent parts of Miskito Bank off the Nicaraguan coast. Smaller numbers of recoveries cluster in Colombia, Panama, and Mexico. Analysis of monthly recovery frequencies in Nicaragua, and of periods of time elapsed between tagging and recapture, reinforce the assumption that Miskito Bank is a resident foraging range and not merely a travel station. Migratory travel speeds based on tag recoveries are compared with those recorded in the literature. (2)Nesting and renesting: The average number of nestings by a Tortuguero turtle during a season at the breeding shore is 2.8; the recorded maximum is seven, although eight probably occur occasionally. There is evidence that one-time nestings are a regular occurrence. The average renesting interval is 12.1 days. Remigrant turtles were found to nest more often than recruits. (3) Remigration: Of 1412 turtles that have returned to Tortuguero after previous appearances there, only six came back the following season. Interval percentages for the three predominant remigration periods are: two years, 21 percent; three years, 49 percent; four years, 18 percent. A unique contribution of the report is an extensive record of remigratory cycle-shifts, and tables showing composition of the nesting colonies of 1962-1972 with respect to past and future remigration-interval frequencies. (4) Reproductive homing: A distinction is made between philopatry, or regional return, and site fixity--the tendency to nest repeatedly on the same beach section within the home region. These two surely involve different cues; and the responses mediating open-sea orientation must be different from both. (5) Size of the West Caribbean population: A calculation of the number of sexually mature green turtles in the western Caribbean is made. An equation that takes into consideration the different proportions of two-, three-, and four-year remigratory periods is used to convert nesting arrivals into total female population. Since the latter varies from year to year, the average for the last six years is used in the calculation, and the resulting figure is doubled, on the assumption that there is a 1:1 sex ratio. The resulting total of mature green turtles in the population is 62,532. In the final section, the future outlook for the population is assessed and the need for further research in its shifting habitats, particularly the internesting habitat, is pointed out. The critical importance of developing an excluder device to keep sea turtles out of shrimp trawls is discussed.

SP  - 75
N2  - A survey of the species of bats occurring on the island of Timor was conducted from February 27 to May 22, 1968. Eleven of the 22 species found are new records for the island, namely: Eonycteris spelaea, Macroglossus lagochilus, Taphozous melanopogon, Taphozous saccolaimus, Rhinolophus borneensis, Rhinolophus creaghi, Rhinolophus philippinensis, Pipistrellus tenuis, Miniopterus australis, Miniopterus magnater, and Miniopterus pusillus. Rhinolophus borneensis parvus, Rhinolophus creaghi timorensis, and Rhinolophus philippinensis montanus are new subspecies. A study of the literature and of the importnat museum collections of bats from Timor indicates that two other species probably occur there also. External structural characteristics and ecological data are given and the taxonomic status on Timor and adjacent islands is discussed for each species. An account of the history of bat study on the island and a discussion of the literature dealing with the bat fauna of Timor is included. An analysis of zoogeographical relationships with adjacent islands and major land masses is discussed and an attempt is made to account for the origin of each species of bat found on Timor.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 163
SP  - 1
N2  - The Paleogene North American lizard Glyptosaurus (Reptilia, Anguidae) Marsh, 1871 is revised. Two new genera, Eoglyptosaurus and Paraglyptosaurus, are named. Helodermoides Douglass, 1903 is resurrected as a valid genus. Glyptosaurus (sensu stricto) is known by one species, G. sylvestris; G. nodosus is placed in the synonymy of G. sylvestris from Grizzly Buttes, Wyoming (middle Eocene). The new genus Paraglyptosaurus (early-middle Eocene) includes the species P. princeps (Marsh, 1872), including as synonyms G. rugosus and G. hillsi. Paraglyptosaurus yatkolai, new species is based on a single frontal from the Wasatchian of New Mexico. Glyptosaurus donohoei White, 1952 is referred to a new genus, Eoglyptosaurus (early Eocene). Two species of Glyptosaurus (sensu lato) are considered nomina dubia: Glyptosaurus sphenodon Marsh, 1872 and Glyptosaurus obtusidens Loomis 1907. Glyptosaurus montanus and Glyptosaurus giganteus are synonyms of Helodermoides tuberculatus Douglass 1903 (early-middle Oligocene). The late Eocene Mongolian Glyptosaurus near nodosus Gilmore, 1943 is transferred to Helodermoides as a new species, H. mongoliensis. The late Eocene European species Placosaurus Gervais, 1852, its type P. rugosus, Placosaurus waltheri (Weigelt, 1929), and Placotherium waltheri (Weigelt, 1929) are considered nomina dubia. Two tribes are designated: the tribe Glyptosaurini to include Eoglyptosaurus, Paraglyptosaurus, Glyptosaurus, and Helodermoides and the tribe Melanosaurini to include the other glyptosaurines Melanosaurus, Arpadosaurus, Peltosaurus, and Xestops. The subfamily Glyptosaurinae is the most primitive subfamily of the Anguidae, and the subfamily Anguinae is the most derived based on dermal armor morphology, mandibular length, palatal teeth, presence or absence of limbs, presence or absence of premaxillary fenestrae, the nature of the postorbital-postfrontal association, and the state of fusion of various skeletal elements. The tribe Melanosaurini is the most primitive tribe of the subfamily Glyptosaurinae and the tribe Glyptosaurini is the most derived based on the morphology of the epidermal scale impressions upon the dermal armor. Helodermoides is viewed as the most derived glyptosaurinid and glyptosaurine. The primitive nature of Helodermoides is regarded as paedomorphic owing to its late occurrence. The tribe Gly[p]tosaurini as a whole is regarded as a paedomorphic lineage primarily based upon the disintegration of dermal armor into discrete hexagonal osteoderms. Because of the primitive nature of Odaxosaurus it is removed from the subfamily Anguinae and designated Anguidae: incertae sedis.

N2  - The lizards of the genus Cnemidophorus related to C. sacki occupying the region from southern Sonora to western Jalisco and Colima, Mexico, are studied with respect to variation and distribution. With the use of the relative size of the dorsal scales (expressed as the number of scales around midbody) as the most important character for distinguishing species, and the color pattern of large adult lizards as the most important intraspecific variable, it is possible to recognize three species and a total of nine forms (species and subspecies) within the area of study ...

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 158
SP  - 223
N2  - Four genera (Microparamys, Sciuravus, Griphomys, and Pareumys) and seven species of small rodents are discussed from Eocene deposits in two areas of San Diego County, California. Fossils from the greater San Diego area (Friars and Mission Valley formations) suggest an earliest 'Uintan' (roughly mid Eocene) age. Specimens from the northwesternmost corner of San Diego County in Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base (?Santiago Formation) suggest a significantly younger assemblage, time-correlative with the Uintan part of the Sespe Formation of Ventura County, California. Sciuravus does not occur in the Pendleton-Sespe localities nor does Griphomys in the greater San Diego area. One species (Griphomys toltecus) is described as new from Camp Pendleton. Detailed comparisons of the San Diego fauna with taxa from the Rocky Mountain region suggest that widespread overland dispersal of land vertebrates across western North America was possible during at least some part of the earlier Eocene, even by the rodents for which strong edaphic controls on range extension might have been expected. Microparamys sp. cf. M. minutus from San Diego cannot be distinguished from M. minutus from the Powder Wash Bridgerian section of Utah and cannot be ruled out as an ancestor for M. tricus from the Pendleton and Sespe deposits. 'Microparamys sp. D' from the Sespe is a distinct species but is not here formally named. Deciduous premolars in Microparamys and Sciuravus may have been retained well into adulthood. 'Sciuravus powayensis' is probably a complex species that in reality included two extremely closely related species; the complexity is not formalized by a new name. The ancestry of Griphomys may lie near Namatomys fantasma. Similarity is great between Pareumys sp. near P. grangeri (considered a cylindrodontid) from San Diego and Spurimus scotti (considered an ischyromyid) from Wyoming, thus further suggesting the close phylogenetic affinities of the two families.

N2  - (One) Eryops had only four digits in the manus. (2) Eryops possessed a well-developed prepollex. (3) The carpus (as well as the tarsus) consists of two moieties; the radius (tibia) moiety, embracing the prepollex (prehallux) and carpal elements, forming the first preaxial ray, and the ulna (fibula) moiety, including the digits and their carpals, converging toward the ulna (fibula). The distinctness of these two moieties is further demonstrated by the subdivisions of the carpal (or tarsal) musculature. (4) The pectoral appendage of Eryops is readily comparable with the pectoral fin of the rhipidistian crossopterygians. The distinctness of the two primary series of carpal elements even in these forms is obvious. (5) All known Amphibia, recent and fossil, possess only four digits in the manus, but embryological and indirect palaeontological evidence allows us to infer that the most primitive Amphibia had a prepollex, five digits, and a postminimus in the hand; a prehallux, five digits, and a postminimus in the foot. (6) The primitive chiropterygium was therefore at least seven-rayed in both the manus and pes, but with a tendency toward a reduction in the two marginal rays, which has proceeded furthest in the last postaxial ray. (7) The carpus of Eryops and the primitive chiropterygium possessed three medialia and one centrale, as well as the radiale, intermedium, ulnare and carpalia. (8) The phalangeal formula of Eryops was only 2-2-3-2 in the manus.

N2  - The evolution of the pelvis of saurischian dinosaurs is discussed. The marked change in the pubo-ischium is attributed to the changed position of the femur, which has resulted in a shifting of many muscles posteriorly and dorsally. The similarity of the saurischian musculature to that of the Crocodilia is pointed out. A restoration of the pelvic musculature of Tyrannosaurus is attempted.

T1  - Herpetofauna of the Yutajé-Corocoro massif, Venezuela : second report from the Robert G. Goelet American Museum-Terramar Expedition to the northwestern tepuis.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 261
SP  - 1
N2  - The Yutajé-Corocoro massif is a highly eroded sandstone table mountain, with internal drainage mainly to the central valley of the Río Corocoro, a stream in the headwater drainage of the Río Manapiare--some 100 km east of the middle Río Orinoco, at the northern edge of the State of Amazonas in southern Venezuela. The rocky soil supports a mosaic of diverse scrubland and forest, with small tepui meadows at the higher elevations. The herpetofauna is depauperate, as is typical of the Venezuelan tepuis. Eight species of amphibians and reptiles were collected during a 7-day period in the dry season (February). This sample includes two new frogs (Hyalinobatrachium eccentricum, n. sp., Centrolenidae; Colostethus undulatus, n. sp., Dendrobatidae) and a new genus and species of lizards (Adercosaurus vixadnexus, n. gen. & sp., Teiidae), all of which were found in humid montane mossy forest at 1700-1750 m elevation. Another new lizard (Tropidurus panstictus, n. sp., Tropiduridae) was discovered at lower elevations (180-1220 m), especially in dry scrub. The fauna also includes a widespread lowland frog (Pseudopaludicola llanera Lynch), two tepui frogs (Eleutherodactylus cantitans Myers and Donnelly; E. yaviensis Myers and Donnelly), a tepui lizard (Prionodactylus goeleti (Myers and Donnelly), new combination), a snake (Liophis?) that escaped capture, and another snake (Thamnodynastes corocoroensis Gorzula and Ayarzagüena) obtained by S. Gorzula in 1987. The two Eleutherodactylus and the Prionodactylus also occur on neighboring Cerro Yaví (the type locality), although one of the frogs (E. yaviensis) and the lizard show evidence of differentiation. Based on the original description, the snake Thamnodynastes corocoroensis appears to be distinct from a related species on Cerro Yaví. Two of the new species exhibit characters that are novel or not previously noted. The dendrobatid frog Colostethus undulatus, n. sp. has a glandular supracarpal pad atop the wrist, being best developed in males. This species, which also has the parasphenoid bone curiously concealed, seems to be unusual among tepui Colostethus in lacking the recently described median lingual process. The centrolenid frog Hyalinobatrachium eccentricum, n. sp. has a peculiar bicolored iris, with a dark median sector that conceals the pupil and which apparently dilates with the pupil. This character is retained in preservative and differentiates H. eccentricum from H. crurifasciatum Donnelly and Myers. Both species share a previously overlooked bubblelike structure in the web between the third and fourth fingers, herein termed bulla (possibly parasite induced?).

VL  - 31

N2  - From the known characters of the internal skeleton Brachyostracon appears to be related to the family Sclerocalyptidae chiefly in the development of the teeth, in the elongate skull assigned to it and described by Cuatáparo and Ramirez, and in the general development of the pelvis. Some characters of the exoskeleton, as the lack of a lateral anterior prolongation of the carapace and the disposition of known head shield plates in rows, indicate an affinity to the family Glyptodontidae.

VL  - 31

N2  - "It is shown in this paper that: 1. The genera of Cretaceous chimaeroids which have been described from North America are reducible to three - Edaphodon, Leptomylus, Isotaenia. 2. Edaphodon is the most common form. The 12 species which have been referred to it are reducible to six. 3. of these six, the two named by Cope, Edaphodon smocki and E. tripartitus, are identifiable with the European forms E. agassizi and E. sedgwicki, respectively. 4. These two species survived to a later time (Danian) in America than in Europe (Senonian). The time relations between Europe and America at the close of the Cretaceous were similar to those of the present day; i.e., certain species still living in America which had but recently (in a geological sense) become extinct in Europe. 5. Leptomylus represents the advancing line with a tendancy to develop cutting, instead of crushing, dental plates. This genus, however, is too specialized to be considered ancestral to the modern forms. Their ancestor is probably a genus like Elasmodus or Elasmodectes. 6. There are three localities in America from which Cretaceous chimaeroids are at present known: New Jersey, Mississippi and Wyoming. The first has yielded 9 of the 11 American forms, the other two localities only one species each.

N2  - In the foregoing revision the lines of comparison and study have been confined principally to characters of the teeth and skull, for the reason that by far the greater number of species of horses have been founded on tooth and skull material not associated with other parts of the skeleton. The expeditions of the last few years however are constantly increasing the collections and adding quantities of more complete material, including many specimens in which teeth and bones of the feet are associated. This class of material will greatly aid in working out more fully than has been done the characters of foot development of horses, and should result in throwing added light on the phyletic relations of the extremely varied groups which seem to have reached their culmination, as regards numbers of genera and species, in the Miocene period. The principal results attained by this study are, first, a better understanding and interpretation of the principal characters shown in the numerous and varied types representing the American Miocene horses; second, the reestablishment and better definition of several of the genera and species proposed by Leidy, the validity of which was questioned by Cope; and third, a reclassification of the entire family of the Equiidae. As at present understood, the fact seems to be fairly well established that there is a considerable phyletic hiatus between the groups of the Equidae as above subdivided, which are as yet not bridged over by intermediate forms. Such a hiatus seems especially marked between the Anchitheriinae and the Protohippinae, while these groups greatly overlap each other in time. So far as indicated by any known species the Anchitheriinae could not well have stood in direct ancestral line to the latter group or to the Equiinae. There seems also to be almost as decided a gap between the Anchitheriinae and the known species of the older group, the Hyracotheriinae. The Equiinae may well have been derived from some species of the Protohippus division of the Protohippinae"--P.933-934.

N2  - The bees found as Baltic amber inclusions are revised and the history of studies on these fossils is briefly reviewed. In total this subtropical Eocene fauna contains 36 species and 18 genera, all extinct. These are classified here into nine tribes, six subfamilies, and five families of which six tribes and one family are unknown in the modern fauna. The following taxa are described as new to science: Paleomelittidae, new family; Boreallodapini, Electrobombini, Eomacropidini, Melikertini, Protolithurgini, new tribes; Ctenoplectrellina, new subtribe; Boreallodape, Electrobombus, Electrolictus, Eomacropis, Glaesosmia, Liotrigonopsis, Melissites, Paleomelitta, Protolithurgus, Succinapis, Thaumastobombus, new genera; Boreallodape baltica, B. mollyae, B. striebichi, Ctenoplectrella cockerelli, C. grimaldii, Electrapis krishnorum, Electrobombus samlandensis, Electrolictus antiquus, Eomacropis glaesaria, Glaesosmia genalis, Glyptapis densopunctata, G. disareolata, Liotrigonopsis rozeni, Melikertes clypeatus, Melissites trigona, Paleomelitta nigripennis, Protobombus basilaris, Protolithurgus ditomeus, Succinapis goeleti, S. micheneri, S. proboscidea, Thaumastobombus andreniformis, new species (seven new family-, 11 new genus-, and 22 new species-group taxa). The genus Electrapis is found to be paraphyletic and the subgenera Melikertes, Roussyana, and Protobombus are given generic status outside of Electrapis. The subtribe Electrapina is elevated to tribal rank among the corbiculate Apinae and the subfamily Glyptapinae of Cockerell is reduced to subtribal rank within Osmiini. The genera Chalcobombus and Sophrobombus are newly synonymized with Protobombus. Glyptapis reducta Cockerell is synonymized with G. fuscula Cockerell, Electrapis minuta Kelner-Pillault with Apis palmnickenensis Roussy, Ctenoplectrella splendens Kelner-Pillault and C. dentata Salt both with C. viridiceps Cockerell, Electrapis apoides Manning and Chalcobombus humilis Cockerell both with Protobombus indecisus Cockerell, and Electrapis bombusoides Kelner-Pillault with E. tornquisti Cockerell (new synonymies). The following new combinations are proposed: Electrapis martialis (Cockerell), Melikertes proavus (Menge), M. stilbonotus (Engel), Kelneriapis eocenica (Kelner-Pillault), Protobombus fatalis (Cockerell), P. hirsutus (Cockerell), and Electrapis martialis (Cockerell) (new combinations). A lectotype is designated for Electrapis minuta Kelner-Pillault and neotypes designated for Apis meliponoides Buttel-Reepen, A. palmnickenensis Roussy, Chalcobombus humilis Cockerell, C. hirsutus Cockerell, C. martialis Cockerell, Ctenoplectrella dentata Salt, C. viridiceps Cockerell, Electrapis tornquisti Cockerell, Glyptapis reticulata Cockerell, G. neglecta Salt, Protobombus indecisus Cockerell, P. tristellus Cockerell, and Sophrobombus fatalis Cockerell. The subfamily Xylocopinae is recorded for the first time from amber, and the families Halictidae and Melittidae are confirmed as occurring in Baltic amber. The oldest fossils of the Halictidae, Megachilidae (Lithurginae and Megachilinae), Melittidae, and Xylocopinae are reported and described herein. Keys are presented for the identification of the Baltic amber bees. Three new recent taxa are also proposed: Penapini, Redivivini, and Meliturgulini (new tribes). Cladistic analyses of the Lithurginae, Xylocopinae, and corbiculate Apinae are presented. Preliminary investigation of lithurgine relationships demonstrates that the fossil, Protolithurgus, is sister to extant genera of the subfamily and that Lithurgus s.s. is likely paraphyletic with respect to Lithurgopsis and Microthurge. Xylocopine relationships are generally in accord with those previously proposed: Xylocopini sister to all other tribes and Manueliini sister to the abruptly narrowed mandible tribes (i.e., Ceratinini, Allodapini, and Boreallodapini). Boreallodapini, despite some apparently apomorphic similarities with Ceratinini, is supported as sister to Allodapini. The paleontological evidence for corbiculate bee phylogeny reinforces traditional concepts over relationships of these tribes and contradicts recent molecular studies. Two extinct corbiculate tribes are based on specimens that exhibit worker morphologies indicative of advanced eusocial behavior and are related to the living, advanced eusocial tribes Apini and Meliponini, supporting a hypothesis of a single origin for this behavioral characteristic. The composition of the Eocene bee fauna of Europe is discussed. The fauna is predominantly composed of long-tongued bees, but some short-tongued bees are represented in the families Halictidae, Paleomelittidae, and Melittidae. Bees in Baltic amber are generally allied with groups currently inhabiting sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia, a biogeographic pattern common to many Baltic amber groups. The phylogeny and origin of bees are discussed. The bees are a derived, monophyletic group of the spheciform wasps and presumably arose sometime in the earliest mid-Cretaceous after the origin of angiosperms. Reports of bees from Jurassic strata or earlier are all refuted. All available evidence supports the idea that bees originated shortly after flowering plants and diversified into higher lineages contemporaneously with the radiations of angiosperms. Major bee lineages (i.e., families) were thus presumably established by the late Cretaceous. A catalog of bees presently known in amber and copal is appended as is a catalog of family- and genus-group names for fossil bees (both amber inclusions and compression fossils). A preliminary outline of the tribal classification of Recent and fossil bees with their geological distribution is presented (with three new family-group taxa for living bees).

T1  - The pholcids of Australia (Araneae, Pholcidae) : taxonomy, biogeography, and relationships.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 260

N2  - The pholcid spiders of Australia are revised. Only seven autochthonous genera are recognized: (1) Wugigarra, new genus, includes the Australian species previously assigned to Psilochorus Simon. This genus is largely restricted to eastern Australia. With 22 described species (20 of them new) and about 40 undescribed species in Australian collections, it is probably the most diverse genus on the continent. (2) Trichocyclus Simon is the dominant or only pholcid genus in most areas of Western and South Australia and the Northern Territory; 23 species are described, 20 of them new. (3) Micromerys Bradley is restricted to the tropical and subtropical areas of Queensland and Northern Territory; 7 species are described, 5 of them new. (4) Pholcus Walckenaer has within Australia the same distribution as does Micromerys; 4 autochthonous species are described, all new. Pholcus litoralis Koch is newly synonymized with P. phalangioides (Fuesslin). (5) Panjange Deeleman-Reinhold and Deeleman is represented by a single, previously described species in northern Queensland. (6) Spermophora is restricted to northeastern Queensland; 2 species are described, both new. (7) Belisana Thorell with a single new species in the tropical north of Queensland and Northern Territory. Nine pholcid species are introduced, some of them occurring throughout the continent. They are included in a key. A numerical cladistic analysis is performed using a matrix of 71 taxa (10 of them Australian) and 65 characters. This analysis suggests that the two highly diverse genera (Wugigarra, Trichocyclus) are most closely related to New World, African, and Middle Eastern genera. All other genera are included in the Pholcus group sensu Huber. It is argued that these are probably new tropical elements, having entered Australia from the north probably not earlier than the Pleistocene, while Wugigarra and Trichocyclus are relicts of Gondwanaland, with their presence in Australia dating back to the Mesozoic.

N2  - Following is a summary of the conclusions reached by the writer from this study of the formations of northwestern Texas: (1) There has been no great disturbance or change of level in the region of the Staked Plains since the close of the Triassic, hence the strata of the Triassic which underlie this whole region are for the most part nearly horizontal, and the country at the beginning of the Miocene was comparatively level. (2) The Panhandle (Lower or Middle Miocene) beds were comparatively evenly distributed over the vast area now occupied by the Staked Plains and in addition extended westward to the Rocky Mountains in New Mexico, and spread out to the eastward over a much greater territiory than they now occupy. These deposits seem to be, at least partially, lacustrine in origin. (3) All the formations of the Staked Plains that are of more recent date than the Lower or Middle Miocene are represented by comparatively small areas, and are fluviatile, or aeolian and fluvaiatile, in origin. These later depositions are represented by the Clarendon beds in the vicinity of Clarendon, the Blanco Beds at Mount Blanco, and the Rock Creek beds at Tule Cañon and Rock Creek.

N2  - The chief distinguishing characters of the American Miocene genera as now understood may be given briefly as follows: Hypohippus: Both deciduous and permanent series of teeth brachyodont, no cement; both upper series without external ribs on paracone and metacone; metaloph simple and undivided, but strongly united with the ectoloph; no crochet; metaconid and metastylid of lower teeth undivided or slightly divided by a shallow notch at the summit of an unworn tooth. Parahippus: Both deciduous and permanent series of teeth brachyodont, deciduous series without cement, permanent series sometimes lightly cemented; deciduous upper molars with prominent external ribs on paracone and metacone; metaloph strongly united with ectoloph; crochet well developed, uniting more or less strongly with the protoconule; metastylid strongly developed, with well-marked groove separating it from the metaconid. Merychippus: Deciduous molars brachyodont with little or no cement; permanent series short hypsodont, fully cemented. Protohippus: Both deciduous and permanent series of teeth hypsodont and strongly cemented; permanent series moderately long-crowned; crowns much curved; protocone and protoconule strongly united; fossettes or cement lakes wide transversely with open loops, and usually with comparatively simple enamel borders. Neohipparion: Both deciduous and permanent series of teeth hypsodont and strongly cemented; teeth of permanent series usually longer crowned and upper teeth less curved than in Protohippus; protocone free to near its base as in Hipparion.

N2  - The principal points brought out in the foregoing paper may be briefly summarized as follows: (1) The tracing of the Daphaenus ancestry back into the Wasatch Eocene by way of Prodaphaenus and Uintacyon, which latter has always been considered a creodont. (2) The establishment of the relationship of Daphaenus to Temnocyon, and that of Temnocyon to the living genus Cyon. (3) Tracing the ancestry of the Canis-Cynodictis line back into the Eocene through Procynodictis and Vulpavus. (4) Some additional points in the structure of Cynodictis. (5) The descent of certain South American foxes from North American Miocene species, with the establishment of a new genus, Nothocyon, for their reception. (6) Classification of the Miocene genera of the Canidae. (7) The discovery of the origin of the Procyonidae from the Canidae through the new genus Phlaocyon. (8) The discovery of the genus Viverravus and the establishment of a new family.

N2  - The spotted skunks (genus Spilogale), which were last revised by Arthur H. Howell in 1906, are restudied on the basis of 1974 musuem specimens. Analyses of the distribution, the age, sex, color pattern, and individual variation, the probable prehistory, and the evolutionary trends of spotted skunks are presented. The taxa of the genus are arranged in two species: Spilogale putorius, a large-sized, polytypic species of wide distribution, and Spilogale pygmaea, a monotypic species, small-sized, with a restricted range. The differences between the two species and between the subspecies of Spilogale putorius are mainly those of size and color pattern.

T1  - Anatomy and systematics of the Confuciusornithidae (Theropoda, Aves) from the late Mesozoic of northeastern China.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 242
SP  - 1
N2  - The osteology and plumage of Confuciusornis sanctus and Changchengornis hengdaoziensis from the Chaomidianzi Formation (previously referred to as the lower section of the Yixian Formation) of western Liaoning Province (China) are described in detail. Confusiusornis sanctus and Changchengornis hengdaoziensis have toothless, beaked skulls (the tomial crest is straight in the former species and strongly curved in the latter) and retain the dorsal portion of the nasal process of the maxilla.  The skull of Confuciusornis sanctus is of typical diapsid plan.  It possesses a triradiate postorbital that with the squamosal forms a complete supratemporal arcade.  Furthermore, a robust jugal-postorbital contact completely separates the infratemporal fenestra from the orbit.  Although the postorbital region is not preserved in Changchengornis hengdaoziensis, it likely resembles that of Confuciusornis sanctus.  Both species have abbreviated tails with long pygostyles, not the long, bony tail originally reconstructed in Confuciusornis sanctus.  Scapulae and coracoids are fused to form scapulocorcoids.  The coracoids are strutlike but much shorter than the scapulae.  The furculae are robust and boomerang shaped.  The sterna are long and nearly flat.  The complete basket of gastralia follows the sternum caudally.  The wing elements are short, and proportions among individual bones are primitive in that the hand is longer than either the humerus or the ulna and the ulna is shorter than the humerus.  The pelvis is opisthopubic.  The postacetabular wing of the ilium is much shorter than the preacetabular wing.  Differences in plumage, namely the presence or absence of two very long tail feathers, are observed among several well-preserved specimens of Confuciusornis sanctus.  This difference is likely the expression of sexual dimorphism, although other biological attributes known for extant populations (e.g. differential molting, correlation between sexual maturity and ornamental plumage) indicate that alternative explanations may also account for the observed plumage variation among specimens of Confusiusornis sanctus. Given the latest Jurassic-earliest Cretaceous age of the Chaomidianzi Formation, Confusiusornis sanctus and Changchengornis hengdaoziensis are surely among the oldest know birds after the Early Tithonian Archaeopteryx lithographica.  Confusiusornis sanctus and Changchengornis hengdaoziensis thus furnish the earliest record of beaked birds.  The fully diapsid skull of Confusiusornis sanctus, and presumably of Changchengornis hengdaoziensis, and the absence of a bending zone on the base of the snout suggest that earlier interpretations of the skull of Confusiusornis sanctus as prokinetic are incorrect.  Confuciusornis sanctus probably had very limited cranial kinetic capabilities, if any.  Optimization of the postorbital-jugal contact, a character intimately correlated with intracranial kinesis, in a phylogeny of basal avians indicates that the essentially akinetic condition of the skull of Confuciusornis sanctus is a reversal derived from forms possessing kinetic properties.  Recent recognition of two additional species of Confuciusornis - Confuciusornis chuonzhous and Confuciusornis suniae - are based on anatomical misinterpretations.  Thus, Confuciusornis suniae and Confuciusornis chuonzhous are regarded as junior synonyms of Confuciusornis sanctus.  Confuciusornis sanctus is the sister-taxon of Changchengornis hengdaoziensis, and both are placed within the Confuciusornithidae.  Some of the synapomorphies supporting this grouping include the presence of edentolous jaws, a rostrally forked mandibular symphysis, a reduced claw of manual digit II, and a V-shaped caudal margin of the sternum.  The Confuciusornithidae is considered to be the sister-group of a clade composed of the Enantiornithomorpha and the Ornithuromorpha.  This phylogenetic interpretation is far more parsimonious than previous systematic hypotheses placing the Confuciusornithidae as either within the Enantiornithes or as its sister-group.  Purported climbing specializations of Confuciusornis sanctus are evaluated in light of the available anatomical evidence.  We conclude that both Confuciusornis sanctus and Changchengornis hengdaoziensis were ill suited for tree climbing.  The foot of Changchengornis hengdaoziensis, however, suggests a greater grasping ability than that of Confuciusornis sanctus.  It is argued that both Confuciusornis sanctus and Changchengornis hengdaoziensis were able to fly and take off from the ground.  The remarkable concentration of specimens of Confuciusornis sanctus from a relatively small quarry near the village of Sihetun (Liaoning Province) suggests several events of mass mortality and, perhaps, a gregarious behavior.

T1  - Hybridization among western whiptail lizards (Cnemidophorus tigris) in southwestern New Mexico : population genetics, morphology, and ecology in three contact zones.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 246
SP  - 1
N2  - Cnemidophorus tigris punctilinealis of the Sonoran Desert and C. t. marmoratus of the Chihuahuan Desert contact each other and interbreed in the Animas Valley of southwestern New Mexico. More than 600 specimens have been examined from the contact region, and data on biochemical genetics (mitochondrial DNA haplotypes, protein electrophoresis of nuclear gene products), chromosomes, external morphology (coloration, size, scalation), reproduction, and fitness have been compared for three hybrid zones. Habitats in the contact region were mapped and photographed, and they are discussed in the context of vegetational changes during Pleistocene to Recent times, which affected the geographic distribution of these animals. Data from mitochondrial DNA, allele frequencies at four protein loci (of 36 analyzed), and body coloration demonstrate that the areas of contact have steep, concordant, and coincident step-clines in which most gene exchange occurs in hybrid zones that are 3.2-7.8 km wide. Analyses of allele frequencies, genotype frequencies, and fixation indices (including Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage equilibrium, and cytonuclear equilibrium) indicate a population structure determined primarily by random mating and an absence of selection against hybrids. Estimates of gene flow indicate that the clines resulted from neutral secondary contact initiated with the newest reconnection of the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts within the present interglacial episode, from 1000 to 5000 years ago. This timeframe is consistent with paleoecological data from packrat middens. Analyses of karyotypes, morphology, reproduction, and physiology also fail to detect differences in fitness among lizards with various genotypes. Although it is possible that there are fitness differences that are too small to be detected by the sample sizes we employed, the data indicate that reproductive success, fitness, and the dynamics of populations within the hybrid zones presently are no different from those in nonhybrid populations. Earlier data, which suggested that one of the step-clines was moving, are not supported. The clines are located in fragile semiarid habitats that are subject to desertification. Consequently, we present considerable data and dated photographs of habitats, precise locations of sampling sites, and local allele frequencies, so that future investigators can monitor changes in position, width, or dynamics of these hybrid zones. In addition, the population genetics data are discussed in the context of the following: (1) absence of rare, apparently novel alleles forming in the hybrid zones; (2) genetic comparisons with additional subspecies of C. tigris (C. t. aethiops and C. t. septentrionalis); and (3) interspecific hybridization between C. tigris and other whiptail lizards of either bisexual or unisexual (parthenogenetic, clonal) species. Cnemidophorus tigris is one of the ancestors of some of the parthenogens, which are of hybrid origin, and our interest in their evolutionary history fuels our efforts to improve understanding of hybridization among whiptail lizards.

T1  - A relimitation and revision of the Australasian ground spider family Lamponidae (Araneae, Gnaphosoidea).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 245
SP  - 1
N2  - The ground spider family Lamponidae Simon, previously construed to include only the type genus Lampona Thorell, is relimited to encompass 190 species of Australasian gnaphosoids, most of which have been either undescribed or misplaced in the families Corinnidae and Gnaphosidae. Three subfamilies are recognized: the Lamponinae Simon (including nine genera totalling 81 species), the Centrothelinae, new subfamily (type genus Centrothele L. Koch, including 11 genera, totalling 89 species), and the Pseudolamponinae, new subfamily (type genus Pseudolampona, new genus, including two genera, totalling 20 species). Putative synapomorphies for the family, as relimited, include two newly noted characters: a pair of oval, invaginated abdominal sclerites situated just behind the epigastric furrow, and a highly modified promarginal seta originating near the base of the cheliceral fang. As relimited, the lamponids are exclusively Australasian, and are hypothesized to represent the sister group of the worldwide families Gnaphosidae plus Prodidomidae. The most commonly encountered lamponids are large, synanthropic, and occasionally medically important spiders that have generally been identified as Lampona cylindrata (L. Koch) but actually constitute a group of three closely related species: L. cylindrata, L. murina L. Koch, and L. papua, new species. Of these three species, only L. cylindrata has been found in Western and South Australia and in Tasmania, and that species is also common in Victoria and New South Wales, extends north into south-central Queensland, and has apparently been introduced into the South Island of New Zealand. In contrast, only L. murina has been found in eastern Queensland, and that species also occurs south to Victoria and has apparently been introduced into Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island, the North Island of New Zealand, and the Kermadec Islands; L. papua is known only from New Guinea. Lampona pseudocylindrata Strand is newly synonymized with L. cylindrata; L. formicaria (Urquhart) is removed from the synonymy of L. cylindrata and placed as a junior synonym of L. murina. Three other specific names are newly synonymized within Lampona: L. subaquila Urquhart with L. ruida L. Koch, and L. obnubila Simon and L. paupercula Simon, both with L. brevipes L. Koch. The female of L. quiqueplagiata Simon and the males of L. flavipes L. Koch, L. macilenta L. Koch, L. pusilla L. Koch, L. ruida L. Koch, L. punctigera Simon, and L. foliifera Simon are described for the first time; 47 new species of Lampona are described. The subgenus Lamponina Strand is elevated to generic level. Lampona scutata Strand and Lampona asperrima Hickman are transferred to Lamponina; the male of the former species and the female of the latter are described for the first time. Four new species of Lamponina are described. Seven new genera of lamponines are described: Lamponoides, Lamponata, Lamponova, Lamponicta, and Lamponusa, each for one new species; Lamponega, for three new species; and Lamponella, for 10 new species that are hypothesized to represent the sister group of all other lamponines. Four genera (Aristerus Simon, Asadipus Simon, Centrothele L. Koch, and Stratius Simon) are transferred from the Corinnidae to the Centrothelinae; Prionosternum Dunn is transferred from the Gnaphosidae to the Centrothelinae. Aristerus is placed as a junior synonym of Asadipus, and 18 new species of Asadipus are described. Stratius is placed as a junior synonym of Centrothele; the males of C. lorata L. Koch and C. mutica (Simon) are described for the first time, and eight new species of Centrothele are described. Asadipus lifoui Berland is transferred to the new genus Centrocalia, its female is newly described, and two new species of Centrocalia are described; the genus appears to be endemic to New Caledonia. Asadipus nitidiceps Simon is transferred to Prionosternum and its male is newly described; males previously associated with its newly designated female lectotype belong to P. scutatum Dunn, the female of which is newly described; one new species of Prionosternum is described. Seven other new centrotheline genera are described: Centrina, for 11 new species; Centsymplia, for 1 new species; Longepi, for 8 new species; Queenvic, for 4 new species; Bigenditia, for 2 new species; Graycassis, for 10 new species; and Notsodipus, for 17 new species. The Pseudolamponinae contains two new genera: Pseudolampona, described for 12 new species, and Paralampona, described for 8 new species. Pseudolamponines are hypothesized to represent the sister group of lamponines plus centrothelines. Hypothesized lamponine synapomorphies include a uniquely even endite shape and tubular pedicel sclerites; putative centrotheline synapomorphies include a highly tuberculate carapace, an anterior abdominal scutum in females, an anteriorly truncated ventral pedicel segment, a weakly sclerotized spot on the anterior surface of the chelicerae, and a longitudinal row of three highly modified cylindrical gland spigots on the posterior median spinnerets. Lamponines and centrothelines are united by a deep and sharply demarcated median groove on the palpal endites.

T1  - Mammals of the Rio Juruá and the evolutionary and ecological diversification of Amazonia.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 244
SP  - 1
N2  - We describe the nonvolant mammal fauna of the Rio Juruá of the western Amazon of Brazil, based on collections made during a year-long survey of the river. We, along with our colleagues Drs. Claude Gascon and Carlos Peres, designed the field project to examine the effects of the river on the differentiation among terrestrial vertebrates (mammals, birds, and amphibians and reptiles) at both the community and population levels. This monograph examines only the patterns of geographic variation and community structure of the small-bodied mammals. Species inventories were made at 16 primary trapping localities divided into eight pairs of cross-river sites, with two pairs in each of four regions from near the mouth to the headwaters of the Rio Juruá. A total of 81 species of nonvolant mammals were obtained, including nine new to science. Four of these are described herein; the others have been described elsewhere. We used a standardized trapping protocol to assess community structure at each of the 16 localities that included terrestrial and canopy trap stations in floodplain (várzea) and upland (terra firme) forest formations. Supplemental trapping was done in secondary habitats at all sites. We describe these sites, the trap effort expended, and the placement of trap stations relative to local habitats. We also describe each species of marsupial, sciurid rodent, murid rodent, and echimyid rodent encountered; comment on their systematics; and summarize aspects of habitat use, life history, geographic distribution, and geographic differentiation based on morphological and molecular traits. We examine patterns of differentiation in the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene for samples of 41 of the 45 species of marsupials and rodents obtained within the Rio Juruá Basin, and discuss these patterns from the perspective of the entire Amazon and, in some cases, the Mata Atlantica of coastal Brazil. We also examine patterns of community organization within the Rio Juruá basin and throughout Amazonia, drawing attention to the geographic distribution of what appear to be major faunal units that are independent of habitat differences. Finally, we use principles of phylogeography to analyze patterns of geographic differentiation among the nonvolant mammals with regard to the Riverine Barrier Hypothesis. We show that, while there are few examples of taxa for which the Rio Juruá is apparently a barrier, most taxa either are largely undifferentiated throughout the basin or are sharply divided into reciprocally monophyletic mtDNA haplotype clades separable into upriver and downriver units. We argue that the concordance in the geographic placement of clade boundaries suggests a common history; moreover, both the age of these clades and their geographic position in relation to underlying geological features suggest that landform evolution has been an important, but underappreciated component of diversification within western Amazonia.

N2  - The cranial anatomy of the Mongolian late Cretaceous multituberculate Kryptobaatar dashzevegi is described based on exquisitely preserved specimens collected from Ukhaa Tolgod and Tugrugeen Shireh in the Gobi Desert by joint expeditions of the American Museum of Natural History and the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. Most sutural relationships are preserved, enabling a bone-by-bone description of the skull and lower jaws exclusive of the nasal fossa and paranasal sinuses. A reconstruction of the principal components of the cranial nervous, arterial, and venous systems is facilitated by specimens with exposed endocranial surfaces. Comparisons with previously described multituberculates, other Mesozoic mammaliaforms, and extant mammals allow an assessment of major topics in the evolutionary morphology of the multituberculate and mammaliaform skull, as well as identification of Kryptobaatar as an appropriate model regarding most aspects of the multituberculate skull for future phylogenetic studies. Elements previously unknown or poorly known in multituberculates are described. Included are a complete jugal on the internal surface of the zygoma; the orbital mosaic and foramina, including the optic foramen, the metoptic foramen, the transverse canal, and the foramen for the pituito-orbital vein; and the endocranium with an extensively ossified primary braincase wall formed by the pilae metoptica and antotica. The latter pila is very robust compared with its ossified remnants in non-mammalian cynodonts and monotremes, suggesting that it is a derived multituberculate condition. The co-occurrence of the pilae metoptica and antotica in multituberculates is thus far unique among mammaliaforms, but agrees with the morphology expected to be primitive for Mammalia. This in turn implies an independent loss of an ossified pila metoptica in monotremes, marsupials, and Vincelestes or the loss of the pila metoptica in the ancestry of multituberculates and therians combined with the independent reacquisition of a neomorphic pila metoptica in multituberculates and eutherians. The absence of several elements from the multituberculate skull, controversial in nature, is confirmed, including the prenasal process of the premaxilla, the septomaxilla, the ectopterygoid, and the orbital process of the palatine. Also confirmed is the presence of several controversial elements in the multituberculate skull, including an alisphenoid with a reduced contribution to the braincase and an anterior lamina expanded dorsal to the alisphenoid. Competing anatomical hypotheses for several elements are addressed, including the function of the lateral pterygopalatine trough as muscle attachment and not for the auditory tube, the homology of the postorbital process on the parietal with that on the frontal, the identity of foramina in the anterior lamina as for mandibular nerve branches and not for the mandibular and maxillary nerves, and the function of the jugular fossa as primarily having housed a diverticulum of the cavum tympani and not large cranial nerve ganglia. The cranial arterial system in Kryptobaatar generally resembled that restored for other multituberculates and for other mammaliaforms, in particular the prototribosphenidan Vincelestes. Both Kryptobaatar and Vincelestes had a transpromontorial internal carotid artery, a stapedial artery that ran through a bicrurate stapes, ramus inferior, ramus superior, and an arteria diploëtica magna. The cranial venous system in Kryptobaatar resembled that described for other Mongolian late Cretaceous multituberculates and for monotremes with the major exits of the dural sinuses having been the prootic canal and the foramen magnum. A revised diagnosis of Kryptobaatar distinguishes it from other djadochtatherians (the grouping that includes 10 of the 11 genera of Mongolian late Cretaceous multituberculates) by a pterygoid canal either confluent with or barely separated from the carotid canal and a separate hypoglossal foramen.

T1  - Phylogeny of phyllostomid bats (Mammalia, Chiroptera) : data from diverse morphological systems, sex chromosomes, and restriction sites.

N2  - Phyllostomidae is a large (> 140 species), diverse clade of Neotropical bats. Different species in this family feed on blood, insects, vertebrates, nectar, pollen, and fruits. We investigated phylogenetic relationships among all genera of phyllostomid bats and tested monophyly of several genera (e.g., Micronycteris, Mimon, Artibeus, Vampyressa) using 150 morphological, karyological, and molecular characters. Results of parsimony analyses of these combined data indicate that all traditionally recognized phyllostomid subfamilies are monophyletic and that most taxa that share feeding specializations form clades. These results largely agree with studies that have used a taxonomic congruence approach to evaluate karyological, immunological, and limited sets of morphological characters, although our finding that Phyllostominae is monophyletic is novel. Our results indicate that several genera (Micronycteris, Artibeus, Vampyressa) are not monophyletic. We propose a new classification for Phyllostomidae that better reflects hypothesized evolutionary relationships. Important features of this new classification include: (1) formal recognition of two clades that group nectarivorous and frugivorous subfamilies, respectively, (2) redefinition of Glossophaginae and recognition of two tribal-level taxa within that subfamily, (3) recognition of several tribal-level taxa in Phyllostominae, (4) formal recognition of two clades that have been colloquially referred to as 'short-faced' and 'long-faced' stenodermatines, (5) elevation of the subgenera of Micronycteris to generic rank, (6) recognition of Mesophylla as a junior synonym of Ectophylla, (7) recognition of Enchisthenes as a distinct genus, and (8) retention of Dermanura and Koopmania as subgenera of Artibeus. Although Vampyressa is not monophyletic in our tree, we recommend no nomenclatural change because we did not include all Vampyressa species in our study. Comparisons of character and taxonomic congruence approaches indicate that character congruence provides improved resolution of relationships among phyllostomids. Many data sets are informative only at limited hierarchical levels or in certain portions of the phyllostomid tree. Although both chromosomal and immunological data provide additional support for several clades that we identified, these data sets are incongruent with many aspects of our phylogenetic results. These conflicts may be due to methodological constraints associated with the use of karyological and immunological data (e.g., problems with assessing homologies and distinguishing primitive from derived traits). Among other observations, we find that Macrotus waterhousii, which has been thought to have the primitive karyotype for the family, nests well within the phyllostomine clade. This suggests that results of previous analyses of chromosomal data may need to be reevaluated. Mapping characters and behaviors on our phylogenetic tree provides a context for evaluating hypotheses of evolution in Phyllostomidae. Although previous studies of uterine evolution in phyllostomids and other mammals have generally supported the unidirectional progressive fusion hypothesis, our results indicate that intermediate stages of external uterine fusion are often derived relative to the fully simplex condition, and that reversals also occur with respect to internal uterine fusion. Uterine fusion therefore appears to be neither completely unidirectional nor progressive in Phyllostomidae. Evolution of the vibrissae and noseleaf is similarly complex and homoplasy is common in these structures; however, many transformations in these systems diagnose clades of phyllostomids. Within Phyllostomidae, there is considerable derived reduction in numbers of vibrissae present in various vibrissal clusters. The phyllostomid noseleaf seems to have become a much more elaborate and complex structure over evolutionary time. Primitively within the family, the spear was short, the internarial region was flat, and the horseshoe was undifferentiated from the upper lip. Subsequently, within the various subfamilies, the spear became more elongate, the central rib and other internarial structures evolved, and the labial horseshoe became flaplike or cupped in some taxa. Dietary evolution in phyllostomids appears somewhat more complex than previously thought. We find that most of the major dietary guilds (e.g., frugivory, sanguivory) are represented by a single large clade within Phyllostomidae, indicating that each feeding specialization evolved once. However, reversals do occur (e.g., loss of nectar- and pollen-feeding in many phyllostomines and stenodermatines), and some specializations may have evolved more than once (e.g., carnivory).

T1  - Taxonomic composition and systematics of late Cretaceous lizard assemblages from Ukhaa Tolgod and adjacent localities, Mongolian Gobi Desert.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 249
SP  - 1
N2  - Upper Cretaceous deposits at Ukhaa Tolgod and adjacent localities in the Mongolian Gobi Desert have yielded a large number of superbly preserved lizard specimens, including representatives of several new taxa (described in this paper) and important supplementary material of several previously poorly known taxa. Study of these specimens gives important insight into the taxonomic diversity and systematics of the Late Cretaceous lizard fauna of the Gobi Desert. A preliminary survey indicates that the lizard assemblage from Ukhaa Tolgod and adjacent localities consists of some 30 species in four higher groups (Iguania, Gekkota, Scincomorpha, and Anguimorpha). The iguanians are documented by eight species, including three species newly recognized in this paper. The Scincomorpha are the most diverse group, represented by as many as 14 species including three new and 11 previously known species. The Anguimorpha are nearly as diverse as the Iguania, while the Gekkota is the least diverse group with a single species documented in the assemblage. The scincomorphs include forms that are highly specialized for burrowing life-styles, interpreted from their cranial morphology as possibly analogous to extant species. The anguimorphs include phylogenetically important basal members of several major anguimorph clades. The paleoecological significance of these lizards cannot be overlooked. According to tooth morphology, most lizards are predatory in terms of habit, while true herbivorous species are rare. Most specimens are preserved as skulls articulated with mandibles, but virtually complete skeletons in situ are quite common. Delicate parts of the skull, such as the braincase and ear ossicles, are undistorted and the surfaces of the bones show no sign of sand abrasion. These observations indicate not only relatively quick burial but also burial under relatively mesic climatic conditions with low-energy water involved during the taphonomic process.

T1  - Classification of the bee tribe Augochlorini (Hymenoptera, Halictidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 250
SP  - 1
N2  - The halictid bee tribe Augochlorini is revised at the level of genus and subgenus. Forty-one genera and subgenera are recognized with two being extinct. New subgenera of Augochlora, Electraugochlora, and of Oligochlora, Soliapis, are described for new fossils from Tertiary amber of the Dominican Republic. Complete taxonomic histories are given along with information on revisions at the species level, biological studies, and general distribution for each family- and genus-group taxon. The following subgenera are newly synonymized: Aethechlora new junior subjective synonym of Oxystoglossella, Mycterochlora new junior subjective synonym of Augochlora, Vachalius new junior subjective synonym of Neocorynurella, and Neocorynuroides new junior subjective synonym of Neocorynura. The group Glyptochlora is resurrected from synonymy as a valid subgenus of Augochloropsis. The males of Chlerogella and Micrommation are described for the first time. A key to the genera and subgenera of the tribe is presented along with a key to the species of the rare Augochloropsis (Glyptochlora). Suprageneric relationships in the tribe are explored cladistically. Characters of adult external morphology (72 characters) and ethology (12 characters) are coded for all recognized augochlorine genera as well as outgroups from the Halictini, Nomioidini, and Nomiinae. Results of the cladistic analysis are remarkably resolved but not very robust. The cladogram is summarized and infratribal groups defined. Most notably, the tribe is divided into two monophyletic subtribes: the Corynurina (new subtribe), containing the southern South American genera Corynura, Halictillus, Rhectomia, and Rhinocorynura; and the nominate subtribe, Augochlorina. Implications of the cladistic analysis on diversification in the Augochlorini and evolutionary patterns within the tribe are discussed. New distribution records are given for three species which extend the known ranges of their respective genera. Augochlora essequibensis is a new junior subjective synonym of A. nigrocyanea while A. cladopyga, A. seminigra, Augochlorella bidentata, Halictus caucasicus, H. cerasis, H. chrysaspis, H. myrrhites, H. simotes, and Pereirapis rhizophila are all new junior subjective synonyms of P. semiaurata. Megalopta intermedia, Augochlora nitidior, Augochlorella eusticta, Augochlorodes clementis, and Augochloropsis scabriceps are all recognized as nomina nuda. Vachalius cosmetor, from Colombia and Venezuela, is transferred to Neocorynurella while Corynura biciliata, from Costa Rica, is recognized as a species of Halictini and is transferred to the genus Lasioglossum (Evylaeus) (new combinations). Four fossil and recent species new to science are described as Augochlora (Electraugochlora) leptoloba (fossil), Augochlora (Oxystoglossella) rightmyerae (extant), Oligochlora (Soliapis) rozeni (fossil), and Pseudaugoehlora pulchra (extant).

T1  - A history of herpetology at the American Museum of Natural History.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 252
SP  - 1
N2  - Those who use and care for collections are subtly hindered if they lack understanding of the history of their collections. The present work provides a frame of reference for the American Museum's accumulations of Recent amphibians and reptiles for the department established to curate and use them. The herpetological holdings began in 1869 with purchase of the collection of Maximilian, Prince of Wied-Neuwied, and additional specimens began accumulating from other sources. But the signature and scope of the collection were most importantly determined by the explosion of expeditionary fever at the American Museum in early 20th century and by establishment of a department with curators charged with organizing and studying the incoming collections. A Department of Ichthyology and Herpetology was formalized in 1909 and later split in 1920. The original department had three ichthyologists and one herpetologist--Mary Cynthia Dickerson, who also served as editor of the American Museum Journal (= Natural History as of 1919) and as Curator of the old Department of Woods and Forestry. Despite an incredible workload, Dickerson threw herself into both herpetological exhibition work and collection building--two parts of a calculated tripartite effort at establishing a major herpetology department that could stand on its own with the older departments of the Museum. The third part of Dickerson's evolving program was a conscientious attempt at building a library and center for herpetological research. Frustrated in finding time for her own investigations, she deliberately sought young scholars who could independently conduct both field-work and collection-based research.  She sent Emmett Reid Dunn on his first collecting trip and, by 1916-1917, Dickerson had attracted to her cause assistants Karl Patterson Schmidt, Gladwyn Kingsley Noble, and Charles Lewis Camp. In a few years, with interruption for military service, Dickerson's 'triumvirate' was accomplishing work that would establish the department as the major research center that she had envisioned. Concurrent with her editorship of Natural History and her curatorship of Woods and Forestry, Dickerson established a robust program of herpetological exhibition and research in only a decade. Herpetology--her Department--was officially separated from Ichthyology in February 1920. But Dickerson had been losing a perilous grip on her sanity and, on Christmas Eve of that year, was committed to an asylum, where she died three years later at age 57. Assistant Curator G.K. Noble, age 27, was given formal charge of the Department beginning in 1921.  Although K.P. Schmidt had resigned earlier, Noble arranged for Schmidt's return to help in a difficult transition, during which Noble completed his Ph.D. dissertation and Schmidt brought Dickerson's research to conclusion. Schmidt gave his final resignation in 1922, in order to take charge of the new Division of Reptiles and Amphibians at the Field Museum of Natural History. Noble inherited Dickerson's departmental philosophy and continued her emphasis on exhibition and on building the collection and bibliographic files, although his own research expanded dramatically. Noble never abandoned interest in fieldwork, anatomy, and collection-based systematics, but he combined those pursuits with increasing attention to laboratory-based, experimental investigations using techniques of endocrinology and neurology. In 1928, he received offers for positons at Cornell University and at Columbia University, the latter to replace geneticist Thomas Hunt Morgan (who was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work at Columbia). With support from President Henry Fairfield Osborn and trustee Douglas Burden, Noble's request for new facilities was approved and he stayed at the Museum.  The Department was renamed the Department of Herpetology and Experimental Biology in 1928, with Experimental Biology being split off as a separate department in 1933.  Although Herpetology came to suffer as a result, Noble remained Curator of both departments until his death in December 1940 at age 47. Noble's 'abrasive personality' has given rise to legends that do not stand up under examination, in particular the published claims that he was responsible for firing Assistant Curator Clifford H. Pope in 1935-the year of publication of Pope's Reptiles of China. Over Noble's protest, Pope was dismissed by Director Roy Chapman Andrews, who had become antipathetic to Noble's operation (ostensibly for budgetary reasons) after Osborn's departure as President.  Charles M. Bogart, hired in 1936, became 'Assistant Curator (In Charge)' of the Department of Herpetology after Noble's unexpected death in 1940. A new Director, Albert Parr, introduced the departmental title 'Chairman' in 1942. Parr at that time also dissolved the Department of Vertebrate Paleontology and appointed Edwin H. Colbert as Chair of a new Department of Amphibians and Reptiles that included dinosaurs as well as pickled newts, despite George Gaylord Simpson's protest that 'paleoherpetology and paleomammalogy have much more in common than either one has with its corresponding neozoological specialty.' This was only one of several departmental reorganizations to which Herpetology and other departments have been subjected by administrative fiat, usually with noticeable loss of efficiency. Another reorganization followed shortly, with Bogert installed as Chairman. James A. Oliver was hired as Assistant Curator in 1942, but, after interruption for military service, he resigned in 1948 owing to deteriorating Museum finances. With Bogert's encouragement, Oliver later returned to New York as Curator of Reptiles at the New York Zoological Society; he subsequently served as Director of the American Museum from 1959 to 1969. In replacing Parr as Director, Oliver brought a renewed commitment to systematics in the Museum. Bogert's career (see Myers and Zweifel, 1993) needs to be understood in the larger context of the history of the Department, which owes much to his dedication and stabilizing influence at a time when Parr was de-emphasizing collections. Except for a few war-interrupted years with Assistant Curator Oliver, Bogert was the only Curator in Herpetology from 1940 to 1954. He held the collection as a reasonably well-curated unit during a long period of economic stress and severe understaffing. Richard G. Zweifel was hired as Assistant Curator in 1954. His term of chairmanship (1968-1980) is taken as the beginning of a 'modern' age in the Department, which has continued to expand its collections and improve on the quality of their care. The evolution of curatorial procedure and specimen cataloguing is discussed; the catalogue data were transferred to an electronic database during 1992-1995. One reason for establishing a new department in 1909 had to do with the Museum's expanding exhibition program. Dickerson and Noble considered exhibition work to be of equal importance to research. Dickerson developed the concept of herpetological 'habitat groups' (dioramas) by skillfully employing a variety of preparation techniques-especially wax casting-to create lifelike models engaged in vital activities within complex settings. In 1927, Noble opened a 'Hall of Reptile and Amphibian Life' that incorporated Dickerson's habitat groups and many other newer, less elaborate groups and mounts; he developed the technique of paraffin infiltration to use the animals themselves as exhibited models. Noble's hall celebrated diversity and focused on isolated biological themes. Bogert and Zweifel built on this rich history by conceiving a more integrated exhibit that would stress the biology of amphibians and reptiles in parallel displays, a concept that eventually resulted in the 1977 'Hall of the Biology of Reptiles and Amphibians.' Newer casts could be done in plastic, the best of which, if well painted, equaled in beauty the best of the old wax models. The herpetological exhibits and most curatorial research were made possible by Museum collecting activities. Insight is provided on early departmental fieldwork-a time when night collecting was a "new" technique made feasible by the introduction of acetylene (carbide) and electric lamps. Also discussed are some of the Museum's multidisciplinary expeditions, several of which continued for years. The Museum's great expeditionary period lasted at the outside from 1910 to 1940. Despite the Great Depression, the number of expeditions peaked not in the 1920's (about 114 starts) but in the 1930s (141 starts), owing to increasing numbers of independently financed expeditions conducted under Museum auspices. Any revival of the Era of Great Expeditions after World War II was precluded by a complex of factors, including changing administrative and economic environments in the Museum, as well as the coming age of the airplane and automotive transport. Logistically complicated expeditions were largely replaced by field trips that could more readily be initiated by the curators. The few expeditions still being organized are nostalgic reminders of another time, when collections now irreplaceable were being gathered from around the globe.

T1  - Partition of the Australopapuan microhylid frog genus Sphenophryne with descriptions of new species.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 253
SP  - 1
N2  - Parker (1934) distinguished Sphenophryne from other genera of the Genyophryninae (Spenophryninae in his work) by its pectoral girdle having a more nearly complete complement of bony and cartilaginous elements. Otherwise, the species he placed there were a diverse lot, including ones adapted for climbing, for living in or on leaf litter, or for a cryptic,even burrowing existence. The characteristics of the pectoral girdle are primitive compared to those of other genyophrynine genera, which have reduced or lost one or more of the elements. Thus, the common possession of a primitive girdle is inadequate as the sole character defining the genus. In the present work I review species with the supposedly diagnostic character of Sphenophryne and recognize four genera: Sphenophryne (monotypic), and three removed from synonymy-Austrochaperina (23 species), Liophryne (6 species), and Oxydactyla (5 species). The characters I use to define the genera are for the most part closely tied to the habits of the species and thus are subject to the criticism that homoplasy rather than synapomorphy is demonstrated. Regardless, the probability that the new arrangement identifies four monophyletic lines is considerably greater than the Sphenophryne, as it has been constituted, is monophyletic. Sphenophryne, Liophryne, and Oxydactyla are confined to New Guinea. Austrocaperina has one species on New Britain, four endemic to northern Australia, one shared between Australia and New Guinea, and 18 on New Guinea and adjacent islands. The genus and species Microbatrachus pusillus, based on a hatchling from the Aru Islands, are considered unidentifiable. Of the 35 species recognized, 17 are described as new and one is removed from synonymy.

T1  - New World pholcid spiders (Araneae, Pholcidae) : a revision at generic level.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 254
SP  - 1
N2  - New World pholcids are revised at the generic level, with an emphasis on South America. A total of 47 extant genera occur in the New World, 22 of which are newly described. A preliminary key to the genera of the New World is presented. Redescriptions are given for 11 genera and for 59 species, and 106 species are newly described. Three generic names and 14 specific names are newly synonymized ... A numerical cladistic analysis is performed using a matrix of 61 taxa (48 of them New World pholcids) and 61 morphological characters. The main results of the analysis are as follows: (1) Pholcids are strongly supported as a monophyletic group. (2) Phoicids are separated into the following clades, which are tentatively named to emphasize their character as a working hypothesis: 'ninetines,' 'pholcines' (Metagonia Simon and the Pholcus group sensu Huber), 'holocnemines' (Holocnemus group sensu Timm, Artema Walckenaer, Physocyclus Simon, and Priscula Simon), and the 'New World clade.' Their interrelationships are not definitively resolved. (3) New World pholcids are an assemblage of representatives of all major clades within the family, but most genera are part of the New World clade, which is the only clade restricted to the New World. (4) A hypothesis concerning the evolutionary transformation of characters is given for 41 of the 54 traits scored that vary among pholcids. The following names are newly synonymized: Anomalaia GonzÃ¡lez-Sponga, 1998, with Metagonia Simon, 1893; Blechroscelis Simon, 1893, with Priscula Simon, 1893; Myrmidonella Berland, 1919, with Ninetis Simon, 1890; Blechroscelis coeruleus (Keyserling, 1891), with Coryssocnemis (now Mesabolivar) togatus (Keyserling, 1891); Blechroscelis irroratus Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1947, Psilochorus browningi Roewer, 1951, and Blechroscelis virescens Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1947, with Blechroscelis (now Mesabolivar) aurantiacus (Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1930); Blechroscelis viridis Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1918, with Litoporus (now Mesabolivar) brasiliensis (Moenkhaus, 1898); Hypsorinus conwayi Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1947, with Priscula binghamae (Chamberlin, 1916); Priscula ranchograndensis GonzÃ¡lez-Sponga, 1996, with Priscula venezuelana Simon, 1893; Litoporus abrahami Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1947, with Coryssocnemis (now Litoporus) uncatus (Simon, 1893); Litoporus coccineus Simon, 1893, Litoporus imbecillus (Keyserling, 1891), and Litoporus fulvus Moenkhaus, 1898, with Litoporus (now Mesabolivar) luteus (Keyserling, 1891); Micromerys occidentalis (Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1929), with Micropholcus fauroti (Simon, 1887); Pholcus dubiomaculatus Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1918, with Pholcus phalangioides (Fuesslin, 1775); Physocyclus dubius Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1922, with Physocyclus globosus (Taczanowski, 1874).

T1  - The subtribes and genera of the tribe Broscini (Coleoptera, Carabidae) : cladistic analysis, taxonomic treatment, and biogeographical considerations.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 255
SP  - 1
N2  - Phylogenetic relationships of the genera of the tribe Broscini (Carabidae) are postulated based on cladistic methods. Seventy-three morphological characters were examined in 88 species, arranged in 41 genera and subgenera, and with the related tribes Melaenini and Apotomini as outgroups. In all the obtained cladograms, the genera are grouped in five clades recognized as the basis for a new subtribal classification: the Oriental-Palearctic-Neotropical Axonyina, new subtribe (type genus, Axonya Andrewes) with 3 genera; the Holarctic-Oriental subtribe Broscina (type genus Broscus Panzer) with 9 genera; the south temperate Australian-Neotropical Nothobroscina new subtribe (type genus Nothobroscus Roig-Juñent and Ball) with 10 genera; the south temperate Neotropical Barypina (type genus Barypus Dejean) with 2 genera; and the south temperate Australian-Neotropical Creobiina (type genus Creobius Guérin-Ménéville) with 11 genera. Species groups within diverse genera Barypus, Eurylychnus Bates, and Promecoderus Dejean were treated as terminal units to test monophyly of these genera. Results of the analysis show that only Promecoderus is not monophyletic, as presently structured. Keys and diagnoses are provided for the genera of Broscini, and all taxonomically important structures are illustrated. Genital features of males and females are described for the first time for several genera. The barypine genus Microbarypus, with its type species M. silvicola (type locality Alto Queulat, Aisén, Chile) is described as new. The species Percosoma concolor Sloane, P. substriatum Moore, and P. montanum Castelnau are transferred to the genus Chylnus. Type species are designated for Adotela Castelnau (Adotela concolor Castelnau), Gnathoxys Westwood (Gnathoxys granularis Westwood), and Cerotalis Castelnau (Cerotalis substriata Castelnau). The four main biogeographical hypotheses proposed to explain Broscini distribution are discussed. Recent discovery of new Neotropical genera, as Nothobroscus Roig-Juñent and Ball and Rawlinsius Davidson and Ball, together with the phylogeny of Broscini, lead to a different biogeographic hypothesis. Broscini can be considered a Pangaeic tribe originating in Lower Jurassic times when there was a land connection between South America and North America on the Pacific margin. In broad terms, the biogeographic pattern of Broscini may be explained by the current hypothesis of the breakup of Pangaea.

T1  - Phylogenetic relationships of mormoopid bats (Chiroptera, Mormoopidae) based on morphological data.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 258
SP  - 1
N2  - Mormoopidae is a small family of Neotropical microchiropteran bats that includes two genera (Mormoops and Pteronotus) and ten species, two of which are known only from fossils. Mormoopidae is typically classified as a member of Noctilionoidea, a group that minimally includes two other Neotropical families (Phyllostomidae and Noctilionidae) and may also include Mystacinidae, a taxon endemic to New Zealand and Australia. Phylogenetic relationships of extant mormoopid species and one extinct taxon, Pteronotus pristinus, were investigated in a series of parsimony analyses of 209 morphological characters including features of the skull, dentition, vomeronasal organ complex and brain, trachea and hyoid apparatus, tongue, face, ears, pelage, patagia, postcranial skeleton, postcranial myology, reproductive tract, and digestive tract. Three extant phyllostomid species, two noctilionids, two mystacinids, and one emballonurid species were included as outgroups to test monophyly of Mormoopidae and to provide a context for determining the sister group of the family. Results of parsimony analyses under a variety of different assumption sets indicate that Mormoopidae is monophyletic, and that Pteronotus and Mormoops are monophyletic sister taxa. Within the genus Pteronotus, several clades were repeatedly recovered: (1) P. davyi + P. gymnonotus (= subgenus Pteronotus); (2) P. macleayi + P. quadridens; (3) P. personatus + P. macleayi + P. quadridens (= subgenus Chilonycteris); (4) P. parnellii + P. pristinus + P. personatus + P. macleayi + P. quadridens; and (5) P. parnellii + P. pristinus (= subgenus Phyllodia). These results support monophyly of all subgenera of Pteronotus previously recognized, and additionally indicate that the subgenera Pteronotus and Chilonycteris are sister taxa. Comprehensive diagnoses for each species and clade of Mormoopidae are provided based on character optimizations and ancillary morphometric data from the literature. Results of our parsimony analyses also have implications for understanding higher-level phylogeny of noctilionoid bats. Monophyly of each of the traditionally recognized families (i.e., Noctilionidae, Mystacinidae, Mormoopidae, and Phyllostomidae) was strongly supported. In congruence with recent analyses of mitochondrial gene-sequence data and DNA hybridization experiments, we found strong support for inclusion of Mystacinidae in Noctilionoidea. Using an emballonurid species to root the tree, we found the following interfamilial relationships of noctilionoids: (Noctilionidae (Mystacinidae (Phyllostomidae, Mormoopidae))). Lists of morphological synapomorphies of each of these groups are provided based on character optimizations.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 183
SP  - 1
N2  - The excellent cranioskeletal representation of early Tertiary leptictids permits broad comparisons with major groups of living and better preserved fossil mammals. Such comparisons reveal that leptictids are indeed closely related to lipotyphlan insectivorans. This conclusion supports intepretations dating back to the beginning of this century. Such interpretations were abandoned in the last two decades in favor of the view that leptictids were an isolated eutherian clade with no clear affinity to a particular eutherian order. Other eutherian higher categories supported by cranial homologies are an edentate-pholidotan group, a dermopteran-chiropteran group, a glires (rodent-lagomorph) group, a glires-macroscelidid group, an ungulate (sans tubulidentate) group, and a subset of ungulates comprising hyracoids, proboscideans and sirenians. There is some evidence that the edentate-pholidotan clade represents a very remote branch of the Eutheria, and that all other major groups of eutherians form a monophyletic clade (cohort Epitheria). A higher-level classification of the Eutheria that reflects the stronger associations is proposed.

T1  - Systematic studies of oryzomyine rodents (Muridae, Sigmodontinae) : diagnoses and distributions of species formerly assigned to Oryzomys "capito".
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 236
SP  - 1
N2  - We describe the morphological species boundaries and geographic distributions of 10 Neotropical Oryzomys based on analyses of museum specimens (skins and skulls, examples preserved in fluid, chromosomal spreads, and information about collection sites from skin tags, field catalogs, and other sources). These species have been regarded as members of an Oryzomys capito complex and for a long time were consolidated into a single entity identified as O. capito. Our study documents the following: 1. Defining the limits of species within the O. capito complex first requires a comprehensive review and rigorous definition of O. capito itself. We consider Fischer's (1814) Mus megacephalus to be valid and available, designate a neotype to bear the name, and reinstate it as a senior synonym of capito Olfers (1818). We then provide a working definition of O. megacephalus and its close relative, O. laticeps, derived from analyses of morphometric variation, estimates of geographic distributions, and evaluations of synonyms. In our view, O. megacephalus occurs in Amazonia but also extends into eastern Paraguay; its synonyms are capito Olfers (1818), cephalotes Desmarest (1819), velutinus Allen and Chapman (1893), goeldi Thomas (1897), modestus Allen (1899), and perenensis Allen (1901). Oryzomys laticeps Lund (1840) occurs in the Atlantic Forest region of eastern Brazil. We designate a lectotype for laticeps and allocate the names saltator Winge (1887) and oniscus Thomas (1904) as synonyms. 2. We provide the first comprehensive taxonomic revision of Oryzomys yunganus Thomas (1902). Its range covers tropical evergreen rainforest formations in the Guiana Region and the Amazon Basin where, as documented by voucher specimens, it has been collected at the same localities as O. megacephalus, O. nitidus, and O. macconnelli. Specimens of O. yunganus can be distinguished from those of the other three by a combination of body size, pelage texture and coloration, pattern of carotid arterial circulation, occlusal patterns of second upper and lower molars, cranial proportions, and chromosomal features. Appreciable intraspecific geographic variation occurs in diploid number of chromosomes and frequency of occurrence of the hypothenar plantar pad, but sampling inadequacies obscure the significance of this variation. Large body size is characteristic of populations in the western Amazon Basin and in the tepui region of eastern Venezuela; smaller size characterizes populations in the Guianas and along the eastern margin of the Amazon Basin. No other scientific name has been correctly associated with the species. Samples from Mirador, Palmera, and Mera in the western Andean foothills of central Ecuador possess a combination of pelage, cranial, and dental traits that distinguish them from all samples of O. yunganus. These specimens are the basis for a new species we describe here, one that is more closely related to O. yunganus than to any other member of the former O. 'capito' complex. 3. We redescribe Oryzomys bolivaris (reviewed by Pine, 1971, under the name O. bombycinus), amplify its geographic range, and contrast it with O. talamancae and O. alfaroi, two sympatric congeners with which it is often confused. A distinctive set of morphological traits allows unambiguous identification of specimens belonging to O. bolivaris. It is a trans-Andean species recorded from very wet tropical evergreen rain forests extending from eastern Honduras and Nicaragua through Costa Rica and Panamá to western Colombia and Ecuador. Allen's (1901) bolivaris is the oldest name for this species; castaneus Allen (1901), rivularis Allen (1901), bombycinus Goldman (1912), alleni Goldman (1915), and orinus Pearson (1939) are synonyms. 4. We revise the definition of Oryzomys talamancae Allen (1891) provided by Musser and Williams (1985), document additional specimens, describe karyotypes from Ecuadoran and Venezuelan samples, and contrast its morphology, chromosomes, and distribution with those of O. alfaroi and O. megacephalus. The geographic distribution of O. talamancae is also trans-Andean, but it inhabits a wider variety of habitats than does O. bolivaris. We also provide a new synonymy and identify the following scientific names as synonyms of O. talamancae: mollipilosus Allen (1899), magdalenae Allen (1899), villosus Allen (1899), sylvaticus Thomas (1900), panamensis Thomas (1901), medius Robinson and Lyon (1901), and carrikeri Allen (1908). 5. We present hypotheses of species boundaries of four morphologically similar species that we identify as members of the Oryzomys nitidus group: O. nitidus Thomas (1884), O. macconnelli Thomas (1910), O. russatus Wagner (1848), and a species described as new. We recognize the four species by morphological and chromosomal traits, and contrast characteristics of each species with one another. One synonym, boliviae Thomas (1901), is associated with O. nitidus, and two scientific names, incertus Allen (1913) and mureliae Allen (1915), are allocated to O. macconnelli. Synonyms of O. russatus are physodes Brants (1827), intermedia Leche (1886), coronatus Winge (1887), lamia Thomas (1901), legatus Thomas (1925), kelloggi Ávila-Pires (1959), and moojeni Ávila-Pires (1959). We designate lectotypes for russatus and intermedia and identify the holotype of coronatus. Based on voucher specimens, the geographic distribution of O. nitidus is mainly along the Andean foothills and adjacent lowlands in Perú, Bolivia, and nearby western Brazil, but scattered records document its eastward extension through south-central Brazil to Paraguay and northeastern Argentina. Oryzomys macconnelli inhabits the tropical evergreen rain forests of Amazonia. Its distribution partially overlaps that of O. nitidus in western Amazonia, where the two species have been collected together at one locality in Perú, and it is sympatric with the new species, which is recorded only from the lower regions of rios Xingu and Tocantins in northern Pará, Brazil. The distribution of O. russatus is documented by specimens from southeastern and south-central Brazil, southern Bolivia, and northern Argentina; its range is allopatric to those of O. macconnelli, the new species, and O. nitidus except in southern Bolivia, where the latter was collected at the same site with O. russatus. We also examined types and descriptions of taxa associated with Oryzomys subflavus and O. ratticeps to determine if any of those names actually reference members of the O. nitidus group. Although the original description of subflavus Wagner (1842) is vague, the holotype clearly represents an example of that very distinctive species; vulpinus Lund (1840), for which we designate a lectotype, and vulpinoides Schinz (1845) are synonyms of O. subflavus. The oldest name for the species currently known as Oryzomys ratticeps is Mus angouya Fischer (1814), a name not based on a specimen but on Azara's (1801) description of 'Rat troisième, ou Rat Angouya.' Azara's account is so general that it could also apply to individuals of O. subflavus, O. nitidus, or O. russatus. To stabilize the nomenclature of these species, we designate a neotype for Mus angouya Fischer (1814) and treat the following scientific names as synonyms: buccinatus Olfers (1818), leucogaster Wagner (1845), ratticeps Hensel (1872), rex Winge (1887), tropicius Thomas (1924), and paraganus Thomas (1924). We also designate lectotypes for leucogaster and ratticeps. We have not analyzed phylogenetic relationships among the species in the former O. 'capito' complex discussed here. Documenting morphological and distributional boundaries of other biological species now grouped in the genus Oryzomys (alfaroi and its close relatives, for example) must precede, in our view, attempts at phylogenetic reconstruction.

VL  - 131

N2  - Viverravine miacids have been found in all the larger collections of fossil mammals from the middle and late Paleocene rocks of North America. These oldest-known fissipede carnivores are described in detail, the classification is revised, and notes on their probable ecology and known geographic and stratigraphic distribution are included. A list of characters believed primitive for miacids is presented, together with some discussion of possible miacid ancestry. Two genera, Ictidopappus Simpson, 1935, and Protictis Matthew, 1937, are recognized, the latter being raised in rank and including P. (Protictis) Matthew, 1937, P. (Simpsonictis) Mac Intyre, 1962, and a new subgenus, P. (Bryanictis), which unites P. (B.) microlestes (Simpson, 1935) and a new species P. (B.) vanvaleni. The removal of Protictis from Didymictis is discussed; both the Eocene viverravine genera (Viverravus and Didymictis) were derived from Protictis. Several probably new (but unnamed) Paleocene Viverravinae are also described, including a single tooth from the Puerco beds of New Mexico which may represent the oldest known miacid. This specimen (called Puerco-Z informally) is tentatively referred to Ictidopappus. If this assignment is correct, Ictidopappus ranged from northern New Mexico (about latitude 36 N.) to southern Montana (about latitude 46 N.) and from early to middle Paleocene time. The middle Paleocene Protictis (Protictis) and P. (Bryanictis) have been found over the same range and P. (Simpsonictis) occurs from southern Montana to central Wyoming. The possible miacid relationships to the earliest creodonts and leptictid insectivores recently collected in the late Cretaceous of North America are considered, but, as it is impossible to derive the known Miacinae is from any known Paleocene Viverravinae, derivation of the Miacidae from any known American Cretaceous genus is rejected.

T1  - Revision and probable evolution of the Myiarchus flycatchers of the West Indies.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 136
SP  - 331
N2  - The extent of morphological and vocal divergence among West Indian populations of Myiarchus is documented, and a key to the identification of these flycatchers is included. Of the 12 recognizable taxa, seven species (all endemic) are admitted. No new forms are recognized, but substantial changes in specific limits are recommended, based principally on the response of territorial males to the playback of vocal repertoires: four monotypic species, including two on Jamaica (M. validus and M. barbirostris), one on Puerto Rico (M. antillarum), and one in the southern Lesser Antilles (M. nugator); three polytypic species, including one on Cuba, Grand Cayman, and the Bahamas (M. sagrae), one on Jamaica and Hispaniola (M. stolidus), and one in the northern Lesser Antilles (M. oberi). An attempt is made to reconstruct the evolution of these species as newly constituted, and to determine their relative ages, origins, and paths of entry into the West Indian region. It is postulated that Myiarchus entered the West Indies by four primary invasions: three by way of Jamaica, from the Honduran-Nicaraguan bulge, and one via Grenada from Venezuela. The oldest invasion, perhaps by an obscure species in the late Tertiary avifauna of Middle America, led to the development of M. stolidus on Jamaica and Hispaniola. Subsequent range expansions from Hispaniola led to the evolution of M. sagrae and M. antillarum in the Greater Antilles and, more recently, to the polytypic M. oberi in the Lesser Antilles. In order not to obscure the relationships between these species, which are thought to have been derived from stolidus of Jamaica, it is recommended that they be considered a superspecies. After the submergence of the Greater Antillean land masses in the early Pleistocene, a second invasion of Jamaica by a Middle American Myiarchus, now obscure, resulted in the endemic M. validus. A third invasion of Jamaica, probably in the mid or late Pleistocene, by a representative of M. tuberculifer of Middle America, produced another endemic, M. barbirostris. The fourth invasion, no earlier than late Pleistocene, involved the range extension of M. tyrannulus from Venezuela into Grenada. With subsequent isolation this population evolved into M. nugator. Its expansion north of St. Vincent was blocked by a water barrier and competition with a congener already established on St. Lucia. This study of insular populations supports evidence, gained previously from continental species of this genus, that suggests a relative plasticity of morphology in contrast to the conservativeness of certain vocal characters. It has also demonstrated the efficacy of using the behavioral responses of territorial males to experimental playback of vocal repertoires for determining the specific limits of allopatric populations of Myiarchus.

Of these, the following 32 species are new to science: Postelectrotermes tongyaii, Glyptotermes kachongensis, Cryptotermes thailandis, Coptotermes premrasmii, Prorhinotermes tibiaoensiformis, Schedorhinotermes rectangularis, Macrotermes chaiglomi, Macrotermes maesodensis, Odontotermes maesodensis, Odontotermes proformosanus, Odontotermes paraoblongatus, Odontotermes takensis, Hypotermes makhamensis, Speculitermes macrodentatus, Microcerotermes minutus, Microcerotermes paracelebensis, Amitermes longignathus, Havilanditermes proatripennis, Nasutitermes tungsalangensis, Nasutitermes dimorphus, Nasutitermes perparvus, Bulbitermes makhamensis, Bulbitermes parapusillus, Bulbitermes laticephalus, Termes huayangensis, Mirocapritermes latignathus, Mirocapritermes concaveus, Mirocapritermes prewensis, Dicuspiditermes makhamensis, Procapritermes prosetiger, Procapritermes longignathus, and Pseudocapritermes parasilvaticus. 3. The imago of Bulbitermes prabhae, hitherto an unknown caste, is described. 4. Amitermes minor Holmgren has been made a synonym of Amitermes dentatus (Haviland). 5. Eurytermes isodentatus and Nasutitermes deltocephalus, recently described by Tsai and Chen (1963) have been transferred to the genera Indotermes and Bulbitermes, respectively.

N2  - The termite genera with asymmetrical snapping mandibles in the soldier (Paracapritermes Hill, Protocapritermes Holmgren, Quasitermes Emerson, Capritermes Wasmann, Homallotermes John, Dicuspiditermes Krishna, Pericapritermes Silvestri, Procapritermes Holmgren, Labiocapritermes, new genus, Mirocapritermes Holmgren, Cornicapritermes Emerson, Dihoplotermes Araujo, Neocapritermes Holmgren, and Planicapritermes Emerson) are described and illustrated, and their phylogenetic relationships are discussed. A key to these genera is given. The genus Capritermes is treated in an entirely new sense. In it is now included only the single species C. capricornis (Wasmann) from Madagascar. The other species previously placed in Capritermes are now included in other genera. The genera Pseudocapritermes Kemner and Microcapritermes Mathur and Thapa are now considered synonyms of Procapritermes and Homallotermes, respectively. A new genus, Labiocapritermes, from India is described and illustrated, with its type species designated as L. distortus Silvestri, a species previously placed in Capritermes. The genus Pericapritermes, previously reported from the Ethiopian region only, now includes species from the Oriental and Papuan regions that were previously placed in Capritermes. Twelve species names are included as new synonyms.

N2  - The family Kalotermitidae is redescribed. The subfamily names 'Electrotermitinae' and 'Kalotermitinae' are placed in synonymy. The fossil genus Eotermes is removed from the family Kalotermitidae and placed in the family Hodotermitidae. 2. Three hundred and fifty-three species, fossil and living, are classified into 24 genera. Of these 24 genera, the following eight are new: Postelectrotermes, Ceratokalotermes, Comatermes, Incisitermes, Marginitermes, Tauritermes, Bifiditermes, and Bicornitermes. The genera Pterotermes, Proneotermes, Allotermes, and Epicalotermes are resurrected. The genus name 'Proglyptotermes' is relegated to synonymy. All the genera are described, and the generitype species are illustrated. 3. The generic classification is based on a constellation of conservative, adaptive, and regressed characters of both the imago and the soldier castes. 4. The phylogeny of the genera is discussed. The imago-nymph mandible indicates two main evolutionary lines. The first line is represented by the Proelectrotermes-Calcaritermes complex, and the second line by the Incisitermes-Cryptotermes complex. 5. Several cases of convergence are illustrated. In both the main lines of the family Kalotermitidae, the phragmotic head, the enlarged third antennal segment, and the slightly sclerotized median vein have all evolved independently many times. Also, the arolium has been convergently lost in many genera. 6. A discussion on conservative and regressed characters is included. Characters that show phylogenetic advancement or regression are also listed. 7. It is evident from the data on the hosts and Protozoa that the evolution of the genera of the Protozoa did not occur in conjunction with the evolution of the host genera and that the differentiation of the Protozoa genera took place before the differentiation of the host genera.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 26
IS  - 4
SP  - 25
N2  - The difference in petrographic character between the Bridger and Washakie has an important bearing on the problem of correlation in time. The Bridger rocks are rhyolite tuffs containing glassy sanidine while the Washakie rocks are andesitic with soda-lime feldspar. From the absence of agglomerates and the fine-grained character of much of the ash it seems probable that it was transported mainly by the wind, and as the prevailing winds are at present from the west and had probably the same direction in Tertiary time, the centers of eruption should be located somewhere in the west or southwest. The absence of agglomerates does not favor the idea of local contemporaneous vents discharging rhyolitic and andesitic ash respectively and the great thickness and uniform petrographic character of each formation is opposed to the conception of rapid variation in the chemical composition of the ash at a single center of eruption. Assuming contemporaneous deposition from two centers of eruption it seems probable, in view of the comparatively short distance separating the areas occupied by the two formations (about 50 miles)¹ that some intermixture of the two types of ash should be found, but the conspicuous  absence of plagioclase feldspar from all the Bridger tuffs and its presence in all those of the Washakie shows that this has not occurred. The lithologic evidence, therefore, does not favor the idea of contemporaneity for any part of the Bridger or Washakie. The faunistic evidence of contemporaneity of the lower Washakie and Upper Bridger is therefore in contradiction to the lithological evidence. ¹Estimate based on map of Fourth Parallel Survey.

N2  - The development of a mass etching program for the recovery of silicified fossils from Permian limestone of west Texas has resulted in the accumulation of a large number of fossil gastropods and has made possible the present systematic study of the pleurotomarian gastropods. Most of the collections used herein were made by, or under the direction of, G. Arthur Cooper, Norman D. Newell, and J. Brookes Knight. These collections were obtained from the Wolfcamp, Leonard, and Word formations of the Glass Mountains of Texas and from the Hueco, Bone Spring, and Cherry Canyon formations of the Sierra Diablo and Guadalupe Mountain region. Comments on stratigraphy are made for the orientation of the reader. Little original stratigraphic work has been done, except to verify or corroborate correlations based on other fossil groups. A few of the paleoecological relationships are discussed, with particular emphasis on molluscan assemblages in the Glass Mountains. An instance is cited of a relationship between a Heliospongia and Glyptotomaria (Glyptotomaria) marginata. Statistical methods used include those based on univariate analysis and on allometric growth line comparisons. This latter type of analysis is based on the relative growth line, as estimated by the reduced major axis. Discrimination was based, in part, on a comparison of slope and position differences of the relative growth line between samples. Studies of the logarithmic spiral show that it can be useful in the study of pleurotomarians and may be treated statistically. The value of the logarithmic spiral formula as a discriminatory character must be weighed against the time and labor required in its derivation. Gross measurements of the spiral, such as the use of suture ratios, tend to reduce expenditure of time, but they also reduce accuracy. Some of the directional and non-directional variations within species and genera are noted. This study attempts to show some aspects of pleurotomarian speciation during the Permian. These are particularly well illustrated in the genus Tapinotomaria. Studies of population structure made it possible to understand some of the changes thought to be responsible for most speciation in the families studied. Emphasis is placed on ontogenetic growth characters. The bulk of this paper is devoted to an analysis and description of the rich and heretofore unknown Permian pleurotomarian faunules. The general increase in knowledge about Permian representatives of the superfamily Pleurotomariacea is briefly discussed. Two families, Portlockiellidae and Phymatopleuridae, are diagnosed and discussed. The family Eotomariidae Wenz, 1938, is redefined and expanded. Thirteen genera are discussed herein: Lamellospira and Lacunospira are new; Eirlysia, Tapinotomaria, Discotomaria, Callitomaria, and Shwedagonia are discussed for the first time (see Batten, 1956). Tapinotomaria and Shwedagonia have been discussed at some length because of their interesting evolutionary developments. Five previously described genera are also included, Euconospira, Spiroscala, and Glyptotomaria are redefined; Phymatopleura and Paragoniozona are discussed. A total of 32 species are included, 28 of which are new and named.

T1  - Permian Gastropoda of the southwestern United States. 1. Euomphalacea, Trochonematacea, Pseudophoracea, Anomphalacea, Craspedostomatacea, and Platyceratacea.

N2  - The present paper contributes to the systematic summation of the Permian gastropods of the United States by describing members of six superfamilies from this largely unknown assemblage. The finest Permian section in the United States is in western Texas. Many of the limestones there yield quantities of silicified fossils upon solution in hydrochloric acid. Collecting and acidizing programs of the United States National Museum and the American Museum of Natural History have resulted in the accumulation of large gastropod collections, which form the basis for this work. In addition, smaller collections of both silicified and non-silicified specimens from other areas have been treated. Following a brief review of the technical terms and methods employed in description, some comments on the paleoecology are given. Gastropods occur chiefly in four kinds of assemblages. A characteristic example of each of these assemblages is described, and from the evidence presented it is concluded that two of these four are transported and mixed and two are approximately in situ. It is concluded that most gastropods were from shallow water, where algae were most abundant. Attention is called to possible differences between 'limestone' and 'shale' gastropod faunas, but collections available do not permit one to draw any conclusions at this time. The main part of the paper is given to systematic descriptions of species, genera, and higher categories. All diagnoses and descriptions are original. Superfamilies diagnosed are the following: Euomphalacea, Trochonematacea, Pseudophoracea, Anomphalacea, Craspedostomatacea, and Platyceratacea. Families diagnosed are the following: Euomphalidae, Omphalotrochidae, Trochonematidae, Pseudphoridae, Anomphalidae, Craspedostomatidae, and Platyceratidae. The Craspedostomatidae are divided into three subfamilies: Craspedostomatinae, Brochidinae, and Dichostasinae. The last two are new categories. Genera or subgenera heretofore known and rediagnosed are Straparollus (Euomphalus), Amphiscapha (Amphiscapha), Omphalotrochus, Cyclites, Anomphalus, Brochidium, and Platyceras (Orthonychia). Brochidium has not previously been reported in the Permian of North America. New genera or subgenera recognized are Amphiscapha (Cylicioscapha), Straparollus (Leptomphalus), Planotectus, Babylonites, Discotropis, Diploconula, Sallya, and Dichostasia. The remainder of the paper consists of descriptions of species of the genera listed above. These include two Pennsylvanian species, deemed pertinent to the Permian studies and not described or illustrated since the original diagnosis, and 45 Permian species given in approximate stratigraphic order. Thirty-nine of the Permian species are considered to be new, and 30 species are well enough known to warrant being formally named. Variation in one species of Platyceras (Orthonychia) is considered to be caused by the specimens' being modified to conform to the calyx of several different crinoids. Occurrence data given in connection with all the Permian species are summarized on a single table.

T1  - On the anatomy and evolution of the locomotor apparatus of the nipple-tailed ocean sunfish (Masturus lanceolatus).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 76

N2  - The purpose of this study was to discover, through a structural series from primitive percomorph to Masturus, the evolutionary changes which gave rise to the peculiar locomotor apparatus of the molids. The structural series: (1) generalized percomorph, (2) acanthurid, (3) balistid, (4) diodont, (5) molid, which was worked out by Gregory on skull structure, was adopted as a provisional basis for the present study and the present study affords additional evidence for its validity. In general the following major changes are involved in passing from generalized percomorph to molid: (1) great shortening and deepening of body; (2) extreme emphasis and vertical growth of dorsal and anal fins; (3) corresponding hypertrophy of erector and depressor muscles of dorsal and anal, involving their great extension forward and eventual atrophy and disappearance of mm. inclinatores; (4) corresponding reduction and eventual loss of the lateralis mass of metameric musculature; (5) correlated reduction and loss of undulation of the body and of the true caudal fin; (6) formation of new or pseudo-caudal fin by extension of dorsal and anal, meeting around the shortened caudal end of the column; (7) crowding of the posterior dorsal and anal pterygiophores against the seventh neural and eighth haemal spines; (8) crowding of the body cavity by forward growth of the erector plus depressor muscles of the anal fin; (9) reduction and loss of the puffing habit (will be treated more fully in a paper on Ranzania); (10) the long ligament, from supraoccipital crest to the anterior border of the dorsal fin, probably represents a vestige of the trigger mechanism of balistoids. The characters of the alimentary tract suggest that these fishes are bottom-living forms; the skin, skeleton, and the loss of the air-bladder suggest that they live in deep water and the form of the fins with their powerful muscles indicates an active existence.

VL  - 78

N2  - Thrashers were studied in the wild and in captivity from hatching until about 90 to 96 days old. The physical development, and that of behavior, which appears typically passerine, are recorded. Experiments on enemy recognition were carried out. Such fundamental acts as self feeding and some responses to predators were not exhibited even on leaving the nest; after appearing, both these types of behavior were modified by experience. Enemies were not recognized as such; the thrashers responded to some non-enemies as to their enemies. These responses usually combined exploratory acts and fleeing acts, sometimes a display and once pugnacious activities. Which type was dominant, with the exception of the snake display, appeared to depend not only on the size of the object, its familiarity or otherwise, but also greatly on its activity in relation to the thrashers. Thrashers probably had to learn what not to fear. the snake display appeared to be a more stereotyped pattern of behavior than other responses to enemies. While large snakes elicited this response in maximum intensity, many other objects called it forth in less than maximum intensity. The snake display appeared to be elicited by a pattern of stimuli, and a wide variation in this weakened, without completely destroying it. The feeding response and exploratory pecking were also rather stereotyped in execution; but the stimulus objects which elicited them were very diversified. There was a tendency to actually swallow things within certain limits of size, taste and perhaps texture, but the tendency to peck and seize a wide variety of objects insured that when food objects were available, even though strange, they would be tried. The thrashers' responses to objects appeared to be the result of general tendencies to respond to a wide variety of stimuli. While many of the thrashers' activities had an innate basis, the stimulus conditions in which they were given were generalized. This provided the raw material with which experience worked to fit the thrashers' generalized behavior to its particular environment.

T1  - Results of the Puritan-American Museum of Natural History Expedition to Western Mexico. 9, Herpetology of the Tres Marías Islands.

N2  - The Tres Marías are a group of four islands located 59 to 70 miles off the Pacific coast of Mexico, opposite the State of Nayarit. The herpetofauna includes two species of anurans, one turtle, a crocodile, five lizards, and 11 snakes. A sea snake and at least two sea turtles occur in the waters about the islands. Little evolutionary divergence from mainland stocks has taken place, with only one endemic subspecies of snake and one endemic subspecies of lizard present. The status of an apparently endemic genus of snakes described from the islands cannot be evaluated, because the only known specimen has been lost. Geographic relationships of the reptiles on the islands are predominantly southern; all species but one range to the south of the islands, and several reach Central and South America. With the exception of a single northern lizard, the reptiles and amphibians are thought to have reached the islands by way of a land connection now submerged. The exception is Urosaurus ornatus, which may have rafted to the islands. The population of this species on the Tres Marías is isolated more than 200 miles south of the main range of the species. Review of the taxonomic status of several supposedly endemic subspecies of snakes reveals the need for synonymizing three names proposed for insular populations. These are listed below, with the current nomenclature on the left and the suggested names on the right: Boa constrictor sigma (Smith) = Boa constrictor imperator Daudin; Masticophis flagellum variolosus Smith = Masticophis lineatus Bocourt; Drymarchon corais cleofae Brock = Drymarchon corais rubidus Smith. In addition, a previous decision by Oliver to synonymize another snake (Leptophis diplotropis forreri Smith = L. diplotropis Günther) is followed. This study is based largely on collections made on the Puritan-American Museum of Natural History Expedition to Western Mexico in the spring of 1957. Three species collected at that time are additions to the insular fauna, including the first reported anurans (Syrrhophus modestus pallidus and Bufo mazatlanensis) and a snake (Tantilla calamarina).

VL  - 124

N2  - One. Normal and malignant thymus tissues of the adult teleost Astyanax mexicanus were successfully grown in tissue culture for the first time, with the use of the double cover-slip technique of Maximow. 2. Migration of thymocytes and thymoblasts was observed within the first few hours of in-vitro growth in the normal thymus. Other free cells that also made an early appearance included erythrocytes, small eosinophilic wandering cells, macrophages, and melanophores. Proliferation of epithelial reticular cells was usually observed between 36 and 48 hours after explantation, although occasionally some cells were seen as early as 24 hours. Multinucleation in the epithelial cells is described and discussed. Fibroblasts, present only in cultures of older fish, were the last cells to proliferate, usually after 48 hours. A description of these various cell types and their modes of migration or proliferation is presented. Comparisons are made between the normal thymus in vivo (through histological studies) and the thymus in vitro. 3. Histochemical determinations revealed that the epithelial cytoplasmic inclusions were predominantly lipid in nature (neutral fats and phospholipids). Some of the inclusions contained acid mucopolysaccharides. The possible significance of these results is discussed. 4. There were no clear-cut determinable effects of either mammalian cortisone or whole adrenal extract, in the dosages used, on the normal thymus in vitro. The lack of a valid criterion for such determinations in tissue cultures of thymocytes is discussed. 5. A description is given of the morphology in tissue culture of two spontaneous lymphosarcomas (reputedly of thymic origin), which occurred in our laboratory, in Astyanax. Comparison is made with normal thymus tissue. In general, the rate and extent of proliferation of cells in the tumor cultures far exceeded those in normal thymus cultures. With the limited data available, no valid conclusions can be drawn concerning the effects of various mammalian compounds (compound E, compound A, whole adrenal extract, and ACTH), on the lymphosarcoma in vitro.

T1  - Early Tertiary Tapiroidea of Asia.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 129
SP  - 183
N2  - Early Eocene tapiroids in Asia are known only from a single specimen, representing a form similar to the North American isectolophid Homogalax. The middle Eocene record is equally poor. One isolated lower molar of a form possibly ancestral to the late Eocene genus Teleophus is the only Asiatic tapiroid fossil of undoubted middle Eocene age. In beds that may be late middle or early late Eocene in age, Veragromovia, a genus based on a single upper molar, represents a form similar to the North American helaletid Helaletes, and Schlosseria, a better-known genus with a tridactyl manus, provides an approximate ancestor for the late Eocene genus Lophialetes. Several relatively rich late Eocene faunas reveal a great variety of tapiroids in Asia at that time. Whether this indicates an evolutionary radiation of tapiroids in the late Eocene or merely reflects uneven knowledge of the fossil record is a moot point. Early late Eocene (Irdin Manha age) tapiroids represent at least three families, the Helaletidae, known also in North America, and two newly recognized, solely Asiatic families, the Lophialetidae and the Deperetellidae. The helaletids include advanced species of Helaletes (formerly assigned to Desmatotherium) and a form similar to the North American genus Hyrachyus. The lophialetids are represented by the very abundant Lophialetes, a genus with rhinocerotoid-like molars, and a new genus, Breviodon, a small tapiroid with P[subscript]1-2 lost. A small form with P[superscript]1 lost and convex molar metacones may be related to Breviodon or may represent a distinct new genus. Two new genera, Rhodopagus and Pataecus, both diminutive forms, appear to be divergent offshoots from the Lophialetidae, in which the long molar ectolophs were lingually displaced and run parallel to or confluent with the metalophs. Early late Eocene deperetellids are represented by Teleolophus, a genus with bilophodont molars. In late late Eocene (Shara Murun age) Asiatic faunas, tapiroids are less abundant in both numbers and diversity. Helaletids are represented by species of Colodon, a genus also known in North America. Lophialetids, the dominant elements in early late Eocene faunas, are no longer present. Deperetellids are represented by Deperetella (including Cristidentinus and Diplolophodon), a descendant of Teleolophus in which the anterior premolars are disproportionately lengthened, in specialization for vertical shear. Indolophus, a poorly known Burmese genus, appears to represent an otherwise unknown tapiroid lineage and cannot be assigned to any existing family. Tapiroids are extremely rare in Oligocene deposits in Asia and are represented by only one genus, Colodon (including Paracolodon). Postcranial remains are known for Schlosseria, Lophialetes, and Deperetella. In all three genera the fifth metacarpal is reduced to a tiny vestige and the remaining metacarpals are relatively long and thin, indicating specialization for running. In Deperetella, elongate cervical vertebrae and a high radio-humeral ratio suggest a fleet, gazelle-like animal. It is suggested that the relatively great diversity of late Eocene tapiroids in Asia may be related to the scarcity of artiodactyls in the same faunas. The geographic distribution of late Eocene tapiroids in Asia provides no evidence for climatic zonation at that time. The occurrence of helaletid and isectolophid tapiroids in Asia supports other evidence for faunal exchange between Asia and North America during early and late Eocene time.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 135
SP  - 1
N2  - The lizard family Gekkonidae consists of 82 genera and approximately 650 species. The family is found on the majority of land masses between latitude 50° N. and latitude 50° S. and has adapted to most environmental extremes therein. Important aspects of the general biology of these lizards are summarized for the first time. The relationships of the Gekkonidae to other modern lizards are briefly discussed, and the family is characterized in detail on the basis of internal and external morphology. It is suggested at the limbless lizards of the family Pygopodidae evolved directly from the Gekkonidae. The fossil history of gekkonoids is reviewed, and it appears that the extinct Upper Jurassic family Ardeosauridae is directly ancestral to gekkos. The Ardeosaurinae and the eublepharine gekkos have many characters in common. The Tertiary fossil gekkos Rhodanogekko, Caudurcogekko, and Gerandogekko appear to be more closely related to the Gekkoninae than to the other subfamilies as they are defined herein. These fossil genera and the Ardeosauridae are very similar to modern gekkos, which suggests an Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous origin of the Gekkonidae. The most recently proposed classification of gekkonid lizards, based on the shape of the pupil, does not appear to be a natural one because of the variability of the diagnostic character. A new subfamilial classification is proposed on the basis of an examination of the morphology of all 82 recognized genera, and 283 species and subspecies, represented by nearly 1000 specimens. The following characters are used in the diagnoses: (a) true eyelids or spectacle present, (b) premaxillary bone developing from one or two centers of ossification, (c) calcified postcranial endolymphatic sacs present or absent, (d) preanal organs or escutcheon scales present, (e) ability to vocalize present or absent, (f) number of eggs laid, two or one, (g) supratemporal bone present or absent, (h) number of scleral ossicles, (i) cloacal bones and sacs present or absent, (j) angular bone present or absent, (k) splenial bone present or absent, (l) frontal bone paired or single, (m) nasal bones paired or fused, (n) parietal bones paired or fused, (o) presacral vertebrae precocious or amphicoelous, (p) morphology of the hyoid arch, (q) morphology of the second visceral arch, and (r) squamosal bone present or absent. The number of character-states of each of the 18 diagnostic characters is discussed, and the primitive or advanced condition of each state and their numerical weights are given. Possible parallelisms are also indicated. On the basis of the greatest number of shared or unshared characters and least number of parallelisms, the 82 recognized genera are grouped into four subfamilies: the Eublepharinae, the Sphaerodactylinae, the Diplodactylinae, and the Gekkoninae. The last two subfamilies bear little resemblance to the taxa of the most recently proposed classification in terms of generic composition. The relationships of the four subfamilies are expressed in the form of a phyletic dendrogram which is superimposed on a background of advancement indexes (extrapolated from the numerical weighting of the character-states). The Diplodactylinae appear to have been derived directly from the most primitive subfamily, the Eublepharinae, whereas the Gekkoninae probably evolved from a considerably more advanced form. The gekkonid subfamily Sphaerodactylinae is the most advanced, and it appears to have been derived from the evolutionary stock that gave rise to the Gekkoninae. The four generic assemblages are considered to be of equal taxonomic rank (subfamilies), unlike that proposed in the most recent classification, because of the nearly uniform increase in the total advancement index from group to group. The four taxonomic products are consistent with presently recognized zoogeographical concepts. It appears that southeastern Asia was the place of origin and early evolution of the circumglobal, now largely allopatric, Eublepharinae, and possibly all gekkonid lizards, some time during the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous. The eublepharine genus Aeluroscalabotes is restricted to this general region and appears to be the most primitive living genus of gekkos. Eublepharis is considered to be the closest living relative of Aeluroscalabotes. From the ancestral Eublepharis stock there appear to have been two separate lines of evolution within the subfamily: (1) a New World stock leading to Coleonyx, and (2) an African stock that gave rise to Holodactylus and Hemitheconyx. The magnitude of the morphological differences between the latter two genera may indicate that they did not evolve from a single ancestral Eublepharis-like population. The ancestor of Coleonyx probably arrived in the New World by way of the Bering land bridge through the continuous Paleocene Subtropical floral belt. The southern species group in Coleonyx (elegans and mitratus) appears to be more closely related to Eublepharis than is the northern group (brevis and variegatus). The occurrence of some populations of the northern group in chaparral and subtropical scrub is probably indicative of the pre-desert habitat preference of the complex. The relatively primitive Diplodactylinae are restricted to the Australian Region (today, Australia, New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, and New Zealand). It seems likely that the ancestral diplodactyline stock, following its origin in southeast Asia from an eublepharine ancestor, dispersed in the direction of Australia through the general region of the Indo-Australian archipelago, probably during the late Mesozoic; the Diplodactylinae are considered a member of the autochthonous fauna of the Australian Region. Concurrently, or nearly so, with the origin of the Diplodactylinae, it appears that the Gekkoninae evolved and dispersed westward through southwestern Asia toward Africa, The Gekkoninae are clearly the dominant gekkos today in terms of speciation, diversity of biology, and distribution (continuous circumglobal distribution between approximately latitude 50° N. and latitude 50° S.). Within the Gekkoninae, there appear to have been at least three levels of evolution and radiation. At least two of the earlier gekkonine radiations seem to have centered in Africa and Madagascar and southwestern Asia. The eastern part of the Paleotropical area, in contrast to the west, is dominated by 'modern expanding dominants' that belong primarily to the genera Cyrtodactylus, Gehyra, Gekko, and Lepidodactylus. The few endemic gekkonine genera of the New World do not appear to form a natural group and in most cases seem to have been independently derived from Old World ancestors, the majority of which have an African distribution today. Fortuitous trans-Atlantic rafting is postulated as the general way in which the ancestors of the gekkonine genera dispersed to the New World. The Sphaerodactylinae are restricted to the New World (primarily the Neotropical Region) and may also have been derived from an African stock, possibly near the gekkonine genus Lygodactylus and its relatives. The dominance of the sphaerodactyline gekkos in the New World may be correlated with the absence of a single major gekkonine radiation from that part of its total range.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 140
SP  - 1
N2  - Nine species of anuran amphibians inhabit desert-grassland and semiarid uplands of southeastern Arizona and adjacent New Mexico in the vicinity of the Chiricahua Mountains. Embryos of eight of these were raised under constant temperature conditions in order to determine rates of development and upper and lower temperatures limiting for normal development. The species most tolerant of high temperatures is Scaphiopus couchii, early embryos of which can develop normally at a constant temperature of 34° C. Rana pipiens, with an upper limiting temperature of 31.5° C., may be least tolerant of high temperatures, although the limit for Hyla arenicolor may be even lower. Greater differences exist with respect to low temperatures. Bufo debilis may be least able to withstand low temperatures, but its lower limit was not established with precision. Bufo cognatus is unable to develop normally below 16° C., and B. punctatus probably has approximately the same limit. In contrast, Rana pipiens probably can develop at a temperature as low as 12° C., and the limit for Scaphiopus hammondii may be even lower. The temperatures limiting embryonic development correlate with conditions in the breeding sites. Scaphiopus couchii, with the highest upper limiting temperature, breeds in temporary desert rain pools that are the warmest aquatic habitats. Rana pipiens and Hyla arenicolor, both tolerant of cool waters, inhabit mountain streams. The situation is by no means clear-cut, however, and other factors in addition to temperature tolerance figure importantly in the selection of breeding sites. Rates of embryonic development differ greatly among the eight species. The three species of Scaphiopus exhibit rapid rates at all temperatures, but S. couchii develops more rapidly at high temperatures, and S. hammondii and S. bombifrons develop faster at low temperatures. The three species of Bufo and Hyla arenicolor all show similar rates, markedly slower than those of Scaphiopus. Rana pipiens is by far the slowest of all except at temperatures approaching the minimum tolerated by Bufo, at which pipiens develops at a similar or slightly more rapid rate. The effect of change in temperature on developmental rate (the slope of the rate curve) differs in the same fashion. A given change in temperature has roughly the same effect on the three species of Scaphiopus, and on Bufo and Hyla (most on S. couchii, least on H. arenicolor), and the least effect on Rana pipiens. An increase of 10° in temperature, from 19° to 29° C., increases the rate of development of most of the species about three to four times, but only doubles that of pipiens. The most rapid embryonic development is found in the three species of Scaphiopus that breed in temporary desert rain pools. The species of Bufo and those of Hyla have less rapid rates of development and normally utilize breeding sites where the water supply is more lasting but not necessarily permanent. The slowest developer, Rana pipiens, apparently breeds only in permanent waters. Thus there is a correlation between rate of development and water supply. Rapid development may be particularly advantageous to frogs breeding in warmer habitats because of the increase in the range of temperature tolerance of the embryos that accompanies development. The upper limiting temperatures of embryos of Scaphiopus bombifrons and S. hammondii are rather low early in development, but development is so rapid that the most heat-sensitive stage is likely to be passed before the morning sun warms the ponds to dangerously high levels. Scaphiopus couchii, with an initially high level of temperature tolerance and even more rapid development, is perhaps the best adapted to high temperature among all species studied. Other features of the embryonic stages that may reflect adaptation to temperature include the color and size of the ovum, the form of the egg mass, and the stage of development of the embryo when it hatches. To a considerable extent these features are interrelated. A compact mass of dark eggs exposed to sunlight becomes warmer than surrounding still water, an advantage under cool conditions but disadvantageous in warm water. Embryos in cool water, even in a compact mass, are likely to be exposed to a higher oxygen tension than those in warm water and can develop to a later stage, at which the demand for oxygen increases greatly, before hatching. Among the species studied, only Rana pipiens lays dark eggs in a compact mass from which the embryos hatch at a late stage of development. The remaining species vary greatly in the manner in which the eggs are deposited, but, whether they are arranged singly, in long strings, or in small masses, the eggs are well exposed to the water. Presumably this reduction or lack of clumping is necessary in the low oxygen tension of warm water, and also avoids the concentration of dark pigment that presumably is partly responsible for the differential heating of a compact mass. Other factors may be of greater importance than adaptation to temperature in influencing the form of the egg mass. Eggs deposited singly may have greater survival value in a running-water habitat (less likely to be dislodged, or less conspicuous to predators). Both Bufo punctatus and Hyla arenicolor breed in running water, or where pools may suddenly be scoured by floods, and both produce eggs singly, at least part of the time. The long strings of eggs produced by most species of Bufo, but only by B. cognatus in the study area, evidently are well adapted both to cool and warm still-water habitats. If dark coloration of an ovum promotes absorption of heat, lighter eggs might be anticipated in species adapted to warm-water conditions. Dark pigment, however, may also be of importance in protecting the embryo from injury by ultraviolet radiation, so the relationship is not simple. Related species breeding in the same pond at the same time (Scaphiopus couchii and S. hammondii) have eggs that differ noticeably in the amount of dark pigment. Rana pipiens and Hyla arenicolor hatch relatively late in development (stage 20), usually after the gills have started to function. Such late hatching in species adapted to relatively cool conditions agrees with the presumption that the greater oxygen supply in cool water permits a longer period of development within the egg membranes. Similarly, Scaphiopus couchii hatches earlier (stage 18) than S. bombifrons or S. hammondii (late stage 19 or stage 20) and is adapted to warmer temperature than the last two. Bufo cognatus and B. punctatus conform to the usual Bufo mode of hatching at a very early stage (stage 16 or stage 17), regardless of other indications of adaptation to temperature, whereas Bufo debilis hatches rather late (stage 19). Therefore, although there are indications of correlation between stage at hatching and adaptation to temperature, the relationship is not a critical one. For the most part, there are no strong correlations between the geographic distribution of the species studied and the adaptations of their embryos to temperature. A possible relationship of temperature tolerance to distribution is seen in the species Scaphiopus couchii and S. hammondii. The former ranges eastward from Arizona into the hot desert of southeastern California but does not occur on the Pacific coast. Scaphiopus hammondii does not occur in the California deserts but is present in coastal California. Rainfall in the coastal region is almost totally limited to winter and early spring, when temperatures are suitable for the relatively cold-tolerant hammondii but too low for the early embryos of couchii. These spadefoot toads are not restricted to breeding at any one time of the year, but are limited to breeding in temporary rain pools. This inflexibility of their breeding habits may give temperature a more important role in determining the distribution of Scaphiopus than is the case in other species that can vary both breeding season and habitat to some extent. To summarize, the adaptation of frog embryos to temperature takes a variety of courses. Basically, each embryo in its earliest stages of development is capable of tolerating temperatures within a range characteristic of the species or at least of the population. Typically, this range differs from species to species. The range of tolerance expands as the embryo develops, and a rapid rate of embryonic development may be regarded in part as an adaptation to temperature. Features adaptive to high temperature include laying eggs in small masses and hatching at a relatively early stage of development; conversely, very dark eggs in large masses absorb heat more readily and are thus adapted to cooler waters. Superimposed upon the adaptations of the embryos are adaptive aspects of the breeding habits of the frogs, notably habitat selection and variation in time of breeding. The interactions of these various features permit the coexistence of species that differ from one another, in some cases markedly, in one or more aspects of adaptation to temperature.

T1  - Systematics, biogeography, and evolution of Cynorca and Dyseohyus (Tayassuidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 141

N2  - The genus Cynorca Cope, 1867, is a small peccary of Miocene age which stands at the base of the second evolutionary radiation of the Tayassuidae. Although its ancestry has not been brought to light, the genus probably arose from Thinohyus or Perchoerus, primitive genera that range in age from early Oligocene to early Miocene. The oldest known species of Cynorca is C. sociale (Marsh, 1875), recorded from deposits of early Miocene age in Oregon, Texas, and possibly Nebraska. Cynorca sociale was probably adapted to a relatively moist, temperate climate. Three species of Cynorca are recognized as having been derived from C. sociale. Cynorca proterva Cope (1867), the genotypic species, is known from deposits of probably early late Miocene age in Maryland, South Carolina, Texas, and Nebraska. Although the evidence is imperfect, it is likely that C. proterva arose from a local, coastal population of C. sociale sometime in the early or middle Miocene. Inasmuch as C. proterva has been recorded from primarily Eastern and Gulf coastal localities, it almost certainly preferred moist, lowland habitats. This species apparently also ranged into areas such as western Nebraska along the courses of the major east-flowing tributaries of the proto-Mississippi River system. Cynorca occidentale, new species, is first found in middle Miocene deposits of the Montana-Wyoming-Nebraska area after having differentiated from a local population of C. sociale. Thereafter, in the late Miocene, C. occidentale was apparently restricted to areas of more xeric conditions in southern California. A third species, C. hesperia (Marsh, 1871), is of uncertain status. If a valid species, it lived in Oregon in late middle Miocene or early late Miocene time and was probably derived from a northwestern population of C. sociale. Dyseohyus Stock, 1937, is a larger and more advanced derivative of Cynorca. The more primitive of the two species, D. fricki Stock, 1937, is restricted to the late Miocene of California. Dyseohyus fricki is found in some of the same deposits as C. occidentale and probably was also adapted to relatively xeric conditions. Dyseohyus fricki may have been derived from a segment of the Oregon population of C. sociale that was invading drier habitats. The more advanced species of Dyseohyus, D. stirtoni, new species, is found in deposits of late Miocene age in Colorado, Nebraska, and Texas. Dyseohyus stirtoni was apparently adapted to somewhat drier conditions than the geologically and geographically proximal species, C. proterva. Specimens known as Dyseohyus or Cynorca from Texas range in age from early to late Miocene. If this group of specimens represents a single species, it may have given rise to D. stirtoni and was, in turn, derived from C. sociale. Inasmuch as both D. fricki and D. stirtoni were probably derived from the same species of Cynorca (C. sociale), they can be considered as pertaining to one genus. Dyseohyus, as currently constituted, might be polyphyletic at the subspecies level, but the evidence is not adequate for a definitive decision. Aside from C. sociale, which was ancestral to Dyseohyus, and D. stirtomi, which probably gave rise to some of the later peccary species such as Prosthennops niobrarensis, all other species of the two genera reviewed in this report are terminal lineages. A large form, ?Dyseohyus sp., from the late Miocene of Colorado and early Pliocene of Nevada, is aberrant and of uncertain ancestry. As far as can be determined, it, too, represents a terminal lineage.

T1  - The structure and relationships of the paracanthopterygian fishes.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 141
SP  - 359
N2  - The aim of this work has been to discover whether the superorder Paracanthopterygii is a monophyletic group, and, if so, to find its limits and relationships. The supposed members of this superorder are the Percopsiformes, Gadiformes, Batrachoidiformes, Lophiiformes, and Gobiesociformes. The paper contains illustrated anatomical accounts of the living and fossil members of these groups, and detailed descriptions of the fossil percopsiforms Trichophanes (Oligocene, Aphredoderidae), Amphiplaga, Erismatopterus (both Eocene, Percopsidae), and Sphenocephalus (Upper Cretaceous, Sphenocephalidae), and the possibly related Asineops (Eocene). 2. Although no single character or combination of characters can be found which occurs in all paracanthopterygians and in no other fish, the conjunction of a distinctive type of jaw musculature and caudal skeleton in all living percopsiforms (percopsids, aphredoderids, amblyopsids), most gadiform suborders (gadoids, muraenolepoids, ophidioids), and batrachoidiforms (batrachoidids) justifies the hypothesis that these three orders are members of a monophyletic group distinct from the acanthopterygians. 3. The most distinctive feature of the paracanthopterygian jaw is the presence of a levator maxillae superioris muscle, which seems to be derived in phylogeny from the upper part of the outer division of the adductor mandibulae. The levator maxillae superioris originates on the palatoquadrate and inserts near the head of the maxilla, serving as a tensor which positions and restrains the maxilla during opening of the mouth. The presence of this muscle limits the degree of jaw protrusion; rather than a truly protrusile mouth paracanthopterygians tend to develop a large, circular gape by pivoting the maxilla and premaxilla. 4. Correlated with the presence of the levator maxillae superioris are a number of features of the skull and jaws, especially the tendency to develop a broad, shallow head, with consequent modifications of the skull roof, occipital condyle, and operculum. 5. A levator maxillae superioris muscle and jaws of paracanthopterygian type also occur in macrouroids and zoarcoids (the remaining gadiform suborders) and in antennarioid and some ceratioid lophiiforms. The remaining lophiiforms and the gobiesocids are without a levator maxillae superioris. Outside the Paracanthopterygii, a levator maxillae superioris is known to occur only in myctophid myctophoids and in some cyclopterid scorpaeniforms. 6. The paracanthopterygian caudal skeleton is characterized by the presence of a second ural centrum which is fused with the upper hypurals, two or fewer epurals, and a full neural spine on the second pre-ural centrum. This neural spine appears to be a primary structure, not the result of fusion between an epural and a neural arch. In addition to the percopsiforms, gadoids, muraenolepoids, ophidioids, and batrachoidids, a caudal skeleton of this type also occurs in at least one zoarcoid, although most zoarcoids and the macrouroids have the caudal skeleton reduced beyond recognition. It does not occur in lophiiforms or gobiesociforms, in which the caudal supports are fused in such a way that they resemble those of some advanced acanthopterygians. In Eocene and Cretaceous percopsiforms and in a few living gadoids the caudal skeleton is more primitive, having the upper hypurals autogenous (four upper hypurals in percopsiforms, three in gadoids). 7. Lophiids and gobiesocids, which lack the paracanthopterygian pattern both in the jaw musculature and the caudal skeleton, are linked with batrachoidids and more generalized lophiiforms by a large number of specializations, especially in the skull and shoulder girdle. 8. Apart from the primary specializations of the jaw musculature and caudal skeleton, other paracanthopterygian group trends is include: reduction in the bony cover of the cephalic sensory canals, the development of large, well-separated, exoccipital condyles, crowding of the anterior vertebrae, loss of supramaxillae, development of a deep notch behind the postmaxillary process of the premaxilla, shortening of the basibranchials so that the gill arches converge ventrally, development of projections on the heads of the posterior branchiostegals, increase in the number of pectoral radials, extension of the median fins, and reduction of the squamation. 9. Primitive features of paracanthopterygians that distinguish the group from the acanthopterygians include the presence of an adipose fin, pelvic splint (both in percopsiforms only), basibranchial teeth and second ural centrum, and the absence of a subocular shelf, predorsal bones, and a pelvic spine (a spinelet, questionably homologous with the acanthopterygian spine, present in some ophidioids, batrachoidids, lophiiforms, and gobiesocids). 10. Morphological and paleontological analysis of the paracanthopterygians indicates that the Percopsiformes, which existed in Cretaceous seas, stand near the origin of the group, occupying much the same position as do the Beryciformes among acanthopterygians. The closest relatives of the percopsiforms are the gadiforms, especially the merlucciid gadoids, with which they share many specializations. Within the Gadiformes, two main lineages are recognizable, the gadoid lineage and the ophidioid-zoarcoid lineage. These two lines must have separated in the Cretaceous. The position of the macrouroids and muraenolepoids in relation to these two lineages is still obscure: the Macrouroidei may contain convergently modified gadoid and ophidioid derivatives. The batrachoidiforms, lophiiforms, and gobiesociforms, the precise interrelationships of which remain to be discovered, form a separate lineage which must have diverged from the percopsiform-gadiform line during the Cretaceous or Paleocene. 11. The fossil record of the percopsiforms shows that some trends followed during the evolution of this group (and probably also in the gadiform and batrachoidiform-lophiiform-gobiesociform lineages) are the reverse of those typical of acanthopterygian evolution, notably reduction in the depth of head and trunk and reduction in fin spines and in spination of the skull bones and scales. A corollary of these trends is that the paracanthopterygians must have shared a closer common ancestry with the acanthopterygians than with the myctophoids. 12. The higher euteleosteans are envisaged as comprising three main radiations, the myctophoid radiation, stemming from aulopid-like ancestors, the paracanthopterygians stemming from percopsiform-like ancestors, and the acanthopterygians from berycoid-like ancestors. The distinctions between these are blurred by parallelism and convergence among the three (e.g., development of a subocular shelf, levator maxillae superioris, and fin spines in myctophid myctophoids; convergent resemblance between ophidioids and blennies and between batrachoidids and some scorpaeniforms) and by the existence of groups that appear to be equally ancient but do not fit easily into any of the three radiations, being in many ways intermediate between them (ctenothrissoids intermediate between myctophoids and acanthopterygians; polymixioids, lampridiforms, and Asineops intermediate between paracanthopterygians and acanthopterygians; atherinomorphs resembling but clearly distinct from acanthopterygians). 13. Some groups, previously placed in the protacanthopterygian order Cetomimiformes, seem to belong with these higher euteleosteans; the kasidoroids and cetomimoids are beryciforms, the ateleopoids, mirapinnids, and eutaeniophorids may be lampridiforms. 14. These conclusions are expressed in a new classification (p. 460) which incorporates a new category, 'series,' between order and superorder. 15. New taxa proposed are as follows: Sphenocephalus brachypterygius, new species; suborder Sphenocephaloidei (Percopsiformes); order Polymixiiformes (= Polymixioidei); series Polymixiomorpha, Salmopercomorpha, Atherinomorpha, Percomorpha; superorder Scopelomorpha (= Myctophiformes). 16. Erismatopterus endlichi Cope and E. rickseckeri Cope are synonyms of Amphiplaga brachyptera Cope and E. levatus (Cope), respectively. The family Trichophanidae Cockerell is synonymous with the Aphredoderidae; the family Erismatopteridae Jordan is synonymous with the Percopsidae; the family Kasidoroidae Robins and De Sylva is synonymous with the Gibberichthyidae. The suborder Amblyopsoidei is merged with the Aphredoderoidei; the members of the Cretaceous beryciform suborder Dinopterygoidei are distributed between the Lampridiformes and the Polymixiiformes.

T1  - Philippine rodents : definitions of Tarsomys and Limnomys plus a preliminary assessment of phylogenetic patterns among native Philippine murines (Murinae, Muridae).

VL  - 211
SP  - 1
N2  - Species of Tarsomys and Limnomys are found only on the island of Mindanao in the Philippine Archipelago. Both genera were named by Mearns in 1905 but never adequately diagnosed or described, a situation we rectify in this report. Tarsomys contains the type species, T. apoensis, which has been collected only from tropical lower and upper montane rain forest between 5200 and 7500 ft, and a new species, T. echinatus, known by a sample from tropical lowland evergreen rain forest between 2700 and 3700 ft. Limnomys is monotypic and the species L. sibuanus is represented by only five examples obtained from tropical montane rain forest between 6200-7200 and 9000 ft. Among Philippine murines, the phylogenetic alliances of Tarsomys and Limnomys are with species of Tryphomys, Abditomys, Bullimus, and Rattus. These genera form one of three groups which reflect the broad outlines of a pattern of phylogenetic relationships estimated by us from a preliminary survey of primitive and derived character states among samples of native Philippine murine rodents, based primarily on study skins and skulls. Another group contains the species of Phloeomys, Crateromys, Carpomys, Batomys, Apomys, Crunomys, Archboldomys, Chrotomys, Celaenomys, and Rhynchomys. The final group holds only Anonymomys mindorensis. The relationships of Tarsomys and Limnomys to members within their group are unresolvable within the context of our study.

T1  - Hemipenial morphology of the South American xenodontine snakes : with a proposal for a monophyletic Xenodontinae and a reappraisal of colubroid hemipenes.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 240
SP  - 1
N2  - The New World xenodontine 'colubrids' represent two immunologically distinct assemblages--the Central and South American lineages, neither of which has been well diagnosed to date. I follow this nomenclature and recognize the Central American lineage as containing 22 genera. This clade is supported by the synapomorphy of a sulcus spermaticus bifurcating within or at the base of the capitulum (Cadle, 1984; Myers and Cadle, 1994). The remaining xenodontines constitute a total of 68 presently recognized genera, of which 41 are placed in the subfamily Xenodontinae sensu stricto. The other 27 genera are considered incertae sedis, pending further research. The Xenodontinae sensu stricto are hypothesized as being monophyletic on the basis of the following hemipenial synapomorphies: (1) presence of enlarged lateral spines on the hemipenial body, and (2) two distinctly ornamented regions on the lobes, the asulcate surface bearing enlarged spinulate or papillate calyces (= body calyces). Some taxa recognized as Xenodontinae sensu stricto lack body calyces but have a nude area in the same topographical position (e.g., Psomophis, Tropidodryas). This pattern is viewed as the result of secondary loss. The rationale for this conclusion is based on the hypothesis that body calyces are merely enlarged capitular calyces of the asulcate/medial surfaces of the lobes. In the Xenodontinae, the body calyces are almost always separated from the calyces of the capitulum by a more or less developed overhang (except in a few genera). This overhang is generally retained on the hemipenes where the asulcate/medial surfaces of the lobes are nude (e.g., Psomophis), which supports the view that the body calyces were secondarily lost. Body calyces are also found on the surface of the hemipenial body in its asulcate side (e.g., Philodryas, Pseudablabes, Xenoxybelis). Because body calyces are interpreted as modified 'capitular calyces,' which are restricted to the lobular region and crotch, the presence of these structures far on the hemipenial body is here viewed as a more derived state where the body calyces extend from the lobes to the body. Various presumably monophyletic units are defined within the Xenodontinae sensu stricto. Conophis, Heterodon, and Farancia are clearly assigned to the Xenodontinae sensu stricto. The hemipenial morphology of various suprageneric 'colubrid' taxa are described and compared. The variation of some hemipenial features within the colubroid radiation, as well as their bearing on the higher level phylogeny of colubroids, is investigated.

Acanthogonatus comprises 27 species; Acanthogonatus segne (Simon) is synonymized with A. franki Karsch; A. guttulata (Simon) is synonymized with A. subcalpeianus (Nicolet);  Thalerommata venosa Mello-Leitão is synonymized with A. pissii (Simon); A. notatus (Mello-Leitão) is removed from the synonymy of A. patagonicus (Simon); the female previously identified as A. subcalpeianus was misidentified and belongs to a new species, A. confusus; Bolostromus incursus (Chamberlin) is transferred from the Cyrtaucheniidae to Acanthogonatus; 17 new species of Acanthogonatus are described: A. tolhuaca, A. mulchen, A. chilechico, A. quilocura, A. huaquen, A. juncal, A. alegre, A. nahuelbuta, A. hualpen, A. patagallina, A. vilches, A. recinto, A. peniasco, and A. confusus, from Chile, and A. centralis, A. parana, and A. birabeni, from Argentina; the males of A. franki, A. patagonicus, and A. subcalpeianus, and the female of A. notatus are described for first time. Lycinus Thorell (with eight species) is removed from the synonymy of Mygaloides Nicolet, as Mygaloides is an unidentifiable mygalomorph (perhaps a theraphosid); Lycinus epipiptus (Zapfe) is removed from the synonymy of L. gajardoi (Mello-Leitão); five new species of Lycinus, L. quilicura, L. domeyko, L. frayjorge, L. caldera, and L. tofo are described (all from Chile); L. longipes Thorell does not occur in Chile, previous records actually corresponding to specimens of L. caldera and L. epipiptus; the females of L. gajardoi and L. longipes are described for the first time (previously described female of L. gajardoi is actually that of L. epipiptus). Diplothelopsis Tullgren comprises two species, D. bonariensis Mello-Leitão and D. ornata Tullgren; the placement of D. hastata Mello-Leitão in this genus is almost certainly erroneous, and the genus is exclusively Argentinian. A new genus from Chile is described, Chilelopsis, which contains three new species: C. calderoni (the type species), C. serena, and C. puertoviejo. Chilelopsis is hypothesized to be the sister group of Lycinus + Diplothelopsis. A new genus, Flamencopsis, contains only the type species, F. minima (Chile). Chaco Tullgren comprises seven species; six new species are described: C. tucumana, C. sanjuanina, C. tecka, and C. patagonica from Argentina, and C. tigre and C. socos from Chile; the male of C. obscura is described for first time; Hermacha leporina Simon, from Brazil, said by Raven to belong to Chaco, is transferred to Stenoterommata, and Neostothis Vellard (from Brazil) is removed from the synonymy of Chaco; as relimited, Chaco is restricted to Chile and Argentina. Stenoterommata is represented by seven species (other species occur in Brazil); Stenoterommata argentinensis (Schiapelli and Gerschman) and Brachythele argentina Simon are synonymized with S. platense Holmberg; six new species are described: S. iguazu, S. tenuistylum, S. quena, and S. uruguai, from Argentina, S. crassistylum from Argentina and Uruguay, and S. palmar from Argentina and Brazil. Rachias is represented by only one (new) species, R. timbo. Petropolisia Mello-Leitão is removed from the synonymy of Pselligmus and placed in the synonymy of Rachias. The genus Pycnothele is represented by two species; P. modesta (Schiapelli and Gerschman) is removed from the synonymy of the Brazilian P. singularis Mello-Leitão; the females of P. modesta and P. auronitens (Keyserling) are described for first time. Pselligmus conspersus (Walckenaer) is transferred to Rachias. Xenonemesia Goloboff and Spelocteniza Gertsch are transferred to the Microstigmatidae. Neodiplothele Mello-Leitão is transferred to the Sasoninae (Barychelidae). Brachythele keithi Chamberlin is transferred to the genus Linothele (Dipluridae). A cladistic analysis of nemesiid relationships is provided, based on a matrix including all known species of Acanthogonatus, Chaco, and Diplothelopsini, as well as representatives of most nominal Neotropical nemesiid genera, and several non-Neotropical nemesiids and non-nemesiid bipectinates. The 84 terminals in the matrix were scored for 104 characters. The results of the analysis suggest that Nemesiidae as currently delimited is a paraphyletic group but they do not allow a redelimitation at the familial level; the subfamilies Pycnothelinae and Anaminae as delimited by Raven do not appear as monophyletic.

T1  - The comparative osteology of the Triassic turtle Proganochelys.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 194
SP  - 1
N2  - Proganochelys quenstedti Baur (= Triassochelys dux Jaekel, Stegochelys dux Jaekel) from the late Triassic Norian of Germany is the oldest well-preserved turtle. This paper describes the complete osteology of Proganochelys for the first time. The skull, shell, cervical vertebrae, caudal vertebrae, girdles, and limbs of  Proganochelys are compared with primitive amniotes exemplified by Captorhinus, and with more advanced turtles, the pleurodires and cryptodires. The descriptions of Proganochelys are based on seven specimens, including three skull-shell associations. One of these specimens is an almost complete skeleton of what is hypothesized to be a young adult. Another skeleton is interpreted as a younger juvenile, while the remainder are interpreted as older adults. Proganochelys has the following chelonian synapomorphies: (1) Bony shell consisting of a carapace formed from costal bones with fused ribs, neural bones with fused thoracic vertebrae, and marginal bones; a plastron formed from interclavicle, clavicle, and five paired bones sutured together; carapace and plastron enclosing shoulder girdle and pelvic girdle. (2) Quadrate concave posteriorly and exposed laterally on cheek. (3) Postparietals and postfrontals absent. (4) Lacrimal bone small. (5) Maxilla, premaxilla, and dentary edentulous. (6) Stapes solid, rodlike, without foramen or processes. Proganochelys is hypothesized as the sister group to all other turtles. It retains the following primitive amniote characters absent in other turtles. (1) Supratemporal bone. (2) Lacrimal bone and duct. (3) Moveable basipterygoid  articulation. (4) Middle ear without bony lateral wall. (5) Vomer paired. (6) Paroccipital process of opisthotic attached to braincase only at its distal end. Proganochelys has the following characters that are interpreted as autapomorphies. (1) Ventral tubercle on basioccipital. (2) Tail club. (3) Phalangeal formula (manus and pes) of 2-2-2-2-2. Interpretations of the depositional environment of Proganochelys combined with features of the limb morphology suggest that Proganochelys occupied fresh water as a bottom walker but was not exclusively aquatic or terrestrial.

T1  - Wasatchian (early Eocene) mammals and other vertebrates from Baja California, Mexico : the Lomas Las Tetas de Cabra fauna.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 208
SP  - 1
N2  - Fossil mammal and other vertebrate remains from the Lomas Las Tetas de Cabra in Baja California Norte, Mexico, provide an opportunity to examine the utility of continental scale geochronologies based on land mammal faunas. Early reports proposed a late Paleocene to early Eocene age for this fauna. Recent fieldwork and considerations of cumulative fossil discoveries strongly indicate that the Baja fauna represents the Wasatchian Land Mammal Age (early Eocene) and is strikingly similar to faunas of this age from the western interior of the United States. Wasatchian-age taxa represented in the Baja assemblage include Hyracotherium, Hyopsodus, Meniscotherium (also possibly from Clarkforkian assemblages), Diacodexis, and Prolimnocyon. Also present in the fauna are excellent specimens of Wyolestes and Esteslestes, a new genus of didelphid marsupial, as well as a badly distorted skull of a pantodont. An early Eocene age assignment is supported by analysis of the marine section adjacent to the Tetas de Cabra sequence. The marine organisms are consistent with a middle Ypresian (early Eocene) age assignment. Paleomagnetic analyses of both the terrestrial and marine sections also corroborate this age assignment. These new results substantiate the validity of the Wasatchian as a discrete temporal interval that can be applied at a continental scale. The Wasatchian thus fulfills the expectations for a mammal-based chronology. Similarities, rather than differences, between the Baja assemblage and other Wasatchian-age faunas is the dominant pattern. A choice among dispersal theories for the sources of Wasatchian mammals is not clearly indicated by the faunal evidence.

T1  - Phylogeny and revision of the Platynus degallieri species group (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Platynini).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 214
SP  - 1
N2  - The 36 species of the Platynus degallieri species group are revised. Twenty-five species are newly described: Platynus robustulus, n. sp., P. platynellus, n. sp., P. machetellus, n. sp., P. elliptolellus, n. sp., P. brunnellus, n. sp., P. caerulipennis, n. sp., P. rotundatulus, n. sp., P. minusculus, n. sp., P. stenophthalmus, n. sp., P. angustulus, n. sp., and P. decorellus, n. sp. from México; P. bacatellus, n. sp., P. crypticulus, n. sp., and P. imitativus, n. sp. from México and Guatemala; P. marginissimus, n. sp. from Mexico, Guatemala, and El Salvador; P. rugulellus, n. sp., and P. nevermanni, n. sp. from Costa Rica; P. margaritulus, n. sp., P. barbarellus, n. sp., P. woldai, n. sp., P. flavomarginatus, n. sp., P. mimulus, n. sp., and P. purpurellus, n. sp. from Panamá; P. nitidulus, n. sp. from Costa Rica and Panamá; and P. baorucensis, n. sp. from Dominican Republic. Acupalpus striatulus Reiche, 1843 is synonymized with Anchomenus aeneipennis Dejean, 1831 (new synonymy). Glyptolenopsis Perrault, 1991 is considered a junior synonym of Platynus Bonelli, 1810 (new synonymy). New combinations include Platynus degallieri (Perrault) and P. aeneipennis (Dejean). A key for the identification of the species is provided, and each species treatment includes a synonymy, diagnosis, description, and distributional information. Three Mexican species, close outgroups of the degallieri group, are also described: Platynus pygmaeus, n. sp. from Chiapas and Oaxaca; P. ballorum, n. sp. from Puebla; and P. franiai, n. sp. from Guerrero and Oaxaca. Cladistic analysis based on 59 unit-coded characters is performed on the 36 ingroup taxa. Eleven outgroup taxa are included in the analysis to facilitate character polarization within the degallieri group, and to obtain a preliminary assessment of recent classificatory attempts on the Neotropical Platynus. Patterns of character state change are compared between male and female reproductive characters, and found to corroborate Eberhard's hypothesis of female choice as a determinant in genitalic evolution. Areas of endemism are defined by the distributions of geographically restricted species within the aggregate species-group distributional range, and include the Hispaniolan, Cuban-Bahamian, Mexican, northern Mexican, northern Central American, lower Central American, and South American areas. Area relationships are determined using component analysis. The time of origin of the species group is hypothesized to be Miocene to Oligocene, based on the sister area relationship of northern México with México plus northern Central America--that relationship dated Miocene in the sympatric platynine carabid genus Elliptoleus Bates. The Antillean areas of endemism are ambiguously related either to the Mexican plus northern Central American areas, or to the lower Central American plus South American areas. An Oligocene to Miocene colonization of the Antilles at approximately the time of origin of the species group is consistent with these relationships. The lower Central American diversification can be dated as post-Miocene, corresponding to the Talamancan orogeny in Costa Rica and Panama. The South American area has been recently colonized by two widespread species of the group, and its area relationships are probably due more to recent range expansion than to an accretionary geological event. Information on habitats occupied by the species is presented. Elevational ranges are used as a measure of the stability of habitats occupied by the various species. Brachypterous taxa are shown to occupy ecologically more stable, higher elevational habitats. This association is shown to be based on a relatively limited number of historical events whereby ancestral brachypterous taxa came to occupy high elevation habitats, with repeated vicariance without habitat change increasing the diversity of such clades. Habitat relationships are compared to those predicted under the taxon cycle and taxon pulse hypotheses. Three possible radiations--12 mainland and Antillean species, a subset of this clade comprising 7 Antillean species, and a clade of 19 mainland species of which 12 are found in lower Central America--are tested for conformity to taxon cycle predictions using a randomization test. All sets of empirical data fail to demonstrate significant action of a taxon cycle during the ecological diversification of the group.

T1  - A review of phylogenetic hypotheses for lizards of the genus Sceloporus (Phrynosomatidae) : implications for ecological and evolutionary studies.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 213
SP  - 1
N2  - Species of Sceloporus have figured prominently in studies of population, community, and physiological ecology, social behavior, disease transmission, and biogeography, probably in large part because of the broad distribution of the genus in a variety of habitats, its species diversity, and the diurnal and conspicuous habits of most species, which are often locally abundant. Despite these advantages and the prevalence of Sceloporus in many research programs in organismal biology, many outstanding systematic and evolutionary problems remain, and the Sceloporus radiation has not been rigorously studied from a contemporary phylogenetic perspective. We have undertaken this review with two major objectives: (1) to summarize all information relevant to existing phylogenetic hypotheses for the genus, and make it available in a single document; and (2) to point out some of the ecological and evolutionary questions for which Sceloporus is superbly suited for detailed study, within the context of well-corroborated phylogenetic frameworks. With respect to the first objective, we have summarized the major phylogenetic conclusions of Smith, Larsen and Tanner, Cole, and those based on the largely unpublished cytogenetic data sets of W.P. Hall and C.J. Cole. Alternative hypotheses are compared and summarized with regard to major points of congruence and conflict, and we argue that thorough contemporary systematic studies are urgently needed for the entire Sceloporus radiation. With respect to the second objective, the Sceloporus radiation unequivocally shows three or more independent origins of viviparity, possibly five independently derived heteromorphic sex-chromosome systems, and perhaps six examples of independent secondary loss of sexual dimorphism in color pattern, regardless of which of the existing phylogenetic hypotheses most closely reflects the real evolutionary history. Different radiations within the genus also continue to offer challenging problems in historical biogeography, speciation, macroevolution, hybrid zone dynamics, taxonomy at the species level, population biology, physiological ecology, and comparative ethology. The genus also offers additional potential in relatively unexplored areas such as mate choice/sexual selection, the roles of regional gene duplication in genome evolution; and co-speciation/co-adaptation of host-parasite systems. This potential, particularly great because of the species diversity of the genus, is discussed within the context of comparative biology and phylogenetic inference.

T1  - Brachyceran Diptera in Cretaceous ambers and Mesozoic diversification of the Eremoneura.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 239
SP  - 1
N2  - Sixty-five specimens representing 49 species in 37 genera and 12, possibly 13, families of brachycerous Diptera are described in detail. Some genera are family incertae sedis. They are preserved in Cretaceous ambers from the following areas and ages (abbreviations after each are used to designate the following origins of the ambers): Manitoba and Alberta, Canada (C) (Campanian); central New Jersey (NJ) (Turonian); and Lebanon (L) (Neocomian). All taxa described are new species and most genera are described as new, except where noted. The new taxa and their origins are the following: Tethepomyia thauma (NJ), an extremely apomorphic fly of probable nematocerous affinities. In Rhagionidae: Paleochrysopilus hirsutus (L), Jersambromyia borodini (NJ), Mesobolbomyia acrai (L); and four additional genera (3 L, 1 NJ) that are described and illustrated but not named because of incomplete preservation. Stratiomyidae: a new specimen of Cretaceogaster pygmaeus Teskey (C) is reported, showing newly observed structures that confirm its extremely primitive position in the family; in addition, in NJ amber an additional primitive genus is described but not named, with affinities in the Pachygastrinae, Chiromyzinae, or Beridinae. Hilarimorphidae: Hilarimorphites superba, H. yeatesi, and H. longimedia, all in NJ amber, and the only fossil hilarimorphids. Scenopinidae(?): Proratites simplex (NJ), probably a primitive (proratine) scenopinid, which would be the only Mesozoic fossil of the family. Asilidae: an incomplete, unnamed specimen in NJ amber, which is one of only two Cretaceous records. The most diverse and numerous brachycerans in Cretaceous ambers are in the Empidoidea, with new taxa as follows. Empidinae: Turonempis styx (NJ), Emplita casei (NJ). Atelestinae: Atelestites senectus (L). Nemedina genus group: Cretodromia glaesa (C); Nemedromia campania (C), N. telescopica (C), N. turonia (NJ); Neoturanius asymmetrus (NJ), N. cretatus (NJ), and N. vetus (NJ, possibly also C); Phaetempis lebanensis (L), which is possibly a very plesiomorphic member of this group. The Nemedina group today is represented by a single extant species from Hungary. Tachydromiinae: Cretoplatypalpus americanus (C), with Cretoplatypalpus Kovalev previously known from a species in Cenomanian amber from northern Siberia; and Mesoplatypalpus carpenteri (C). Trichopezinae: Apalocnemis canadambris (C), which is the only species studied here belonging to an extant genus, Apalocnemis Philippi (previously known only from extant species widespread in distribution). Microphorinae: Microphorites similis and M. oculeus (L), two additional species of the extinct genus Microphorites Hennig, known only from Lebanese amber; Avenaphora hispida (L); Cretomicrophorus novemundus (NJ), the second species in the extinct genus Cretomicrophorus Negrobov, originally known from Cretaceous amber of Siberia; Archichrysotus incompletus (NJ) and A. manitobus (C), the genus also previously known from Siberian amber. Dolichopodidae: Sympycnites primaevus (L), which is the oldest definitive dolichopodid. Three new species are described in an unusual new genus, Chimeromyia, known only from Lebanese amber: C. intriguea, C. acuta, and C. reducta. Chimeromyia possesses features of Empidoidea and Cyclorrhapha. The few Cyclorrhapha in Cretaceous ambers are all very plesiomorphic. Platypezidae: Electrosania cretica (NJ), the most plesiomorphic known platypezid. Lebambromyia acrai (L), formally unplaced to family, is a plesiomorphic phoroid closely resembling Ironomyiidae (with one living species in Australia and Tasmania, and one extinct species previously described in Canadian amber). Lonchopteridae: Lonchopterites prisca (L) and Lonchopteromorpha asetocella (L), the only definitive fossils of this small, extant family. Sciadoceridae: Archiphora pria (NJ); and Archisciada lebanensis (L), the oldest fossil of the family and perhaps the most plesiomorphic phoroid. In addition, two new species are described in the Mesozoic genus Prioriphora McAlpine and Martin, P. luzzii and P. casei (both NJ). This is the best represented brachyceran genus in the Cretaceous, although it might be a paraphyletic taxon. Three cyclorrhaphan larvae of uncertain family identities are described, all in NJ amber; one appears similar to Sciadoceridae. Phylogenetic significance of most of these fossils are discussed, as are certain characters of traditional importance in the higher classification of Brachycera, such as the number of aristal articles. The fossils are placed onto cladograms of the lower Brachycera, the Empidoidea, and basal Cyclorrhapha, and a chronology is proposed of the origins of brachyceran families. The Brachycera apparently originated in the Lower Jurassic, with the Asiloidea not diversifying until the Lower Cretaceous. The Eremoneura (Empidoidea + Cyclorrhapha), as expected, show later diversification, with subfamily-level radiations of empidoids in the Lower to mid-Cretaceous, and the most plesiomorphic families of Cyclorrhapha (e.g., Platypezoidea, Phoroidea, Lonchopteridae) appearing in the Lower to mid-Cretaceous. Origins and radiations of the Schizophora almost certainly are of much more recent origin, in the mid to latest Cretaceous and especially the Cenozoic. The diversity and detailed preservation of these fossils contribute exceptional insight into the early evolution of the Brachycera and the Eremoneura in particular.

N2  - A taxonomic listing of 532 species (plus six nomina nuda) of sucking lice (Insecta, Anoplura) described through January 1993 is presented. Listings are arranged alphabetically according to family and genus. For each louse species, the following information is given: 1) author, date, and literature citation for the original description; 2) synonymies, if any; 3) type host mammal species and its taxonomic affiliation; 4) principal host mammal species and their taxonomic affiliations; 5) type locality; 6) known geographical distribution of the louse species; 7) notes pertaining to other key taxonomic, host, or geographical data for the louse species. Two taxonomic changes are made in the checklist as follows: 1) Linognathus setosus bhatii Dutta, 1988, is elevated to species rank as Linognathus bhatii Dutta, 1988; 2) Neohaematopinus baibacinae Blagoveshtchensky, 1965, is reassigned as Linognathoides baibacinae (Blagoveshtchensky, 1965).

The New Zealand anapids are assigned to three new genera: Zealanapis, for Chasmocephalon armatum Forster, C. australis Forster (which is removed from the synonymy of C. armatum), Risdonius conicus (Forster), and seven new species; Novanapis, for Pseudanapis spinipes (Forster); and Paranapis, for Pseudanapis insula (Forster) and one new species. The two previously known New Caledonian anapids, Anapogonia insolita (Berland) and A. pilupilu Brignoli, are assigned to the new genus Caledanapis and the female of the latter species is described for the first time; six additional New Caledonian species are assigned to Caledanapis and two other new genera (Montanapis and Mandanapis). Of the genera previously described from Australia, Acrobleps Hickman is transferred to the Mysmenidae and Olgania Hickman is transferred to the Micropholcommatidae. Pseudanapis aloha Forster, previously known from Hawaii and Yap, is newly recorded from Queensland; seven previously described and 30 new endemic Australian species are assigned to Risdonius Hickman, Chasmocephalon O.P.-Cambridge, and eight new genera (Tasmanapis, Victanapis, Queenslanapis, Hickmanapis, Nortanapis, Maxanapis, Octanapis, and Spinanapis). Chasmocephalon minutum Hickman is transferred to Hickmanapis; Anapogonia crassifemoralis (Wunderlich) and A. burra (Forster) are transferred to Maxanapis, and the female of the former species is described for the first time; Risdonius octoculus (Forster) is transferred to Octanapis; Anapogonia darlingtoni (Forster) is transferred to Spinanapis; and Pseudanapis grossa Forster, from New Guinea, is transferred to Conoculus Komatsu. Anapid morphology, monophyly, and relationships are reviewed. Both the labral spur and glandular openings at the anterolateral corners of the carapace may be synapomorphic for the family; most (perhaps all) species have haplogyne female genitalia.

T1  - Paleogeography of the Caribbean region : implications for Cenozoic biogeography. Bulletin of the AMNH :

VL  - 238

N2  - This paper presents a series of detailed paleogeographical analyses of the Caribbean region, beginning with the opening of the Caribbean basin in the Middle Jurassic and running to the end of the Middle Miocene. Three intervals within the Cenozoic are given special treatment: Eocene-Oligocene transition (35-33 Ma), Late Oligocene (27-25 Ma), and early Middle Miocene (16-14 Ma). While land mammals and other terrestrial vertebrates may have occupied landmasses in the Caribbean basin at any time, according to the interpretation presented here the existing Greater Antillean islands, as islands, are no older than Middle Eocene. Earlier islands must have existed, but it is not likely that they remained as such (i.e., as subaerial entities) due to repeated transgressions, subsidence, and (not incidentally) the K/T bolide impact and associated mega-tsunamis. Accordingly, we infer that the on-island lineages forming the existing (i.e., Quaternary) Antillean fauna must all be younger than Middle Eocene. The fossil record, although still very poor, is consistent with the observation that most land mammals lineages entered the Greater Antilles around the Eocene-Oligocene transition. Western Laurasia (North America) and western Gondwana (South America) were physically connected as continental areas until the mid-Jurassic, ca. 170 Ma. Terrestrial connections between these continental areas since then can only have occurred via landbridges. In the Cretaceous, three major uplift events, recorded as regional unconformities, may have produced intercontinental landbridges involving the Cretaceous Antillean island arc. The Late Campanian/Early Maastrichtian uplift event is the one most likely to have resulted in a landbridge, as it would have been coeval with uplift of the dying Cretaceous arc. However, evidence is too limited for any certainty on this point. The existing landbridge (Panamanian Isthmus) was completed in the Pliocene; evidence for a precursor bridge late in the Middle Miocene is ambiguous. We marshal extensive geological evidence to show that, during the Eocene-Oligocene transition, the developing northern Greater Antilles and northwestern South America were briefly connected by a "landspan" (i.e., a subaerial connection between a continent and one or more offshelf islands) centered on the emergent Aves Ridge. This structure (Greater Antilles + Aves Ridge) is dubbed GAARlandia. The massive uplift event that apparently permitted these connections was spent by 32 Ma; a general subsidence followed, ending the GAARlandia landspan phase. Thereafter, Caribbean neotectonism resulted in the subdivision of existing land areas. The GAARlandia hypothesis has great significance for understanding the history of the Antillean biota. Typically, the historical biogeography of the Greater Antilles is discussed in terms of whether the fauna was largely shaped by strict dispersal or strict continent-island vicariance. The GAARlandia hypothesis involves elements of both. Continent-island vicariance sensu Rosen appears to be excludable for any time period since the mid-Jurassic. Even if vicariance occurred at that time, its relevance for understanding the origin of the modern Antillean biota is minimal. Hedges and co-workers have strongly espoused over-water dispersal as the major and perhaps only method of vertebrate faunal formation in the Caribbean region. However, surface-current dispersal of propagules is inadequate as an explanation of observed distribution patterns of terrestrial faunas in the Greater Antilles. Even though there is a general tendency for Caribbean surface currents to flow northward with respect to the South American coastline, experimental evidence indicates that the final depositional sites of passively floating objects is highly unpredictable. Crucially, prior to the Pliocene, regional paleoceanography was such that current-flow patterns from major rivers would have delivered South American waifs to the Central American coast, not to the Greater or Lesser Antilles. Since at least three (capromyid rodents, pitheciine primates, and megalonychid sloths) and possibly four (nesophontid insectivores) lineages of Antillean mammals were already on one or more of the Greater Antilles by the Early Miocene, Hedges' inference as to the primacy of over-water dispersal appears to be at odds with the facts. By contrast, the landspan model is consistent with most aspects of Antillean land-mammal biogeography as currently known; whether it is consistent with the biogeography of other groups remains to be seen.

T1  - An introduction to the neotropical muroid rodent genus Zygodontomys.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 210
SP  - 1
N2  - Members of the Neotropical muroid rodent genus Zygodontomys are easily studied in the field and laboratory, providing opportunities for innovative research in many biological disciplines. A major impediment, however, is the confused systematics of the genus: no adequate diagnosis of Zygodontomys is available to permit unambiguous identifications, phylogenetic relationships to other muroids are unknown, and the species-level classification is in disarray. This monograph provides a systematic basis for future research with Zygodontomys, summarizes what is known concerning diverse ecological and biogeographic topics, and suggests where new investigations are most likely to yield important results. Zygodontomys can be distinguished from other Neotropical muroids by a unique combination of morphological attributes including external proportions, mammae number, qualitative details of cranial architecture, molar occlusal morphology, molar root numbers, and characters of the viscera. Morphological comparisons among Zygodontomys and putatively related species in the genera Bolomys, Calomys, and Pseudoryzomys afford few characters suitable for phylogenetic analysis, the results of which are inconclusive by the criterion of unweighted parsimony. A broader taxonomic survey of one character, presence or absence of the gall bladder, however, reveals that the presumptive apomorphy (absence) occurs in all oryzomyines (sensu stricto) together with Zygodontomys, Pseudoryzomys, Holochilus, and a few other taxa; some instances of homoplasy are obvious, but the implication of recent ancestry among the above-named genera and oryzomyines (s.s.) merits the attention of future investigators. Variation in quantitative and qualitative morphological characters among 2623 specimens of Zygodontomys is interpreted to reflect the existence of two species. Z. brunneus inhabits the intermontane valleys of the upper Río Magdalena, the upper Río Cauca, the upper Río Dagua, and the upper Río Patía in Colombia. In the upper Río Magdalena valley, Z. brunneus occurs sympatrically with Z. brevicauda, but elsewhere the two species are allopatric. The range of Z. brevicauda extends from the Pacific littoral of eastern Costa Rica through Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, and the Guianas, to northern Brazil. Qualitative character variation in Z. brevicauda reveals geographic patterns of population divergence that serve as the basis for three subspecies: Z. b. brevicauda, Z. b. cherriei, and Z. b. microtinus. Insular populations of Z. b. cherriei in Panama and of Z. b. brevicauda on Trinidad and Tobago average larger in craniodental dimensions than adjacent mainland populations but are not differentiated from them in qualitative characters. Species of Zygodontomys inhabit open savannas, savanna woodlands, thornscrub, shrublands, pastures, agricultural regions, and other types of natural or anthropogenic nonforest habitats on the Central and South American mainland. On some continental-shelf islands, however, Z. brevicauda is known to occur in closed-canopy forests. Most collection records are from elevations below 100 m, but there are numerous well-documented collections from higher altitudes, up to about 1300 m. Z. brevicauda is nocturnal, strictly terrestrial, and apparently omnivorous; it is numerically abundant in most suitable habitats within its ecogeographic range. Despite the dramatic seasonality of rainfall in some regions, populations of Z. brevicauda reproduce continuously throughout the year. Fifty-five species of arthropod ectoparasites have been collected from Z. brevicauda in Panama and Venezuela. Zygodontomys is part of a nonforest vertebrate fauna with a disjunct distribution in northern South America. Other mammals that belong to this fauna include the opossum Lutreolina crassicaudata, the armadillo Dasypus sabanicola, several muroid rodents (Calomys hummelincki, Sigmodon alstoni, and S. hispidus), the cavy Cavia aperea, and the rabbit Sylvilagus floridanus. The occurrence of these and other flightless nonforest vertebrate species in isolated enclaves of savanna and other types of open vegetation surrounded by forests is most parsimoniously explained by vicariance. Independent evidence of paleoclimates suggests that nonforest vegetation in northern South America was more extensive during the last glacial maximum than at present, and the disjunct distributions of some modern nonforest organisms are presumably the consequence of postglacial expansions of rain forests. On this assumption, an evolutionary scenario is proposed to account for the geographic variants of Z. brevicauda. Some of the South American zoogeographic literature is compromised by an uncritical reliance on antiquated subspecies taxonomies, and more revisionary systematic studies will be required to serve as the basis for meaningful historical analyses of the nonforest vertebrate fauna.

T1  - The cladistics and classification of the Bombyliidae (Diptera: Asiloidea).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 219
SP  - 1
N2  - Previous classifications and phylogenetic trees of the Asiloidea and the Bombyliidae are reviewed. Data from male genital musculature presented by Ovchinnikova (1989) and female genitalia by Muhlenberg (1971b) are reanalyzed within a numerical cladistic framework. A cladogram of the Bombyliidae and their relatives is constructed based on a data matrix containing 87 taxa and 154 characters. This study includes 24 non-Bombyliidae taxa used as outgroups, from the families Rhagionidae, Nemestrinidae, Acroceridae, Asilidae, Therevidae, Apioceridae, Mydidae, Scenopinidae, Hilarimorphidae, and Apsilocephalidae. I chose 63 ingroup species representing all the currently accepted subfamilies and tribes except the Xenoprosopinae and Villoestrini. 147 of the characters used were derived from adult morphology and 7 were from larval morphology. The data set was analyzed using the parsimony program Hennig86 which identified 8 most parsimonious trees, each with a length of 716 steps, consistency index of 0.25, and retention index of 0.71. All characters are described and almost all are illustrated using line drawings, photographs, and scanning electron micrographs. Previously used characters are reanalyzed and new character systems are introduced, especially features of the postcranium and cibarium. The Acroceridae and Nemestrinidae do not form a monophyletic group and each should be recognized at superfamily level. The Asiloidea is also weakly monophyletic, based largely on larval features. The Apioceridae is found not to be monophyletic, some included genera being more closely related to the Mydidae. The Hilarimorphidae, including the proratine Apystomyia Melander, form the sister-group to the Bombyliidae. The remaining Proratinae form a clade with the Scenopinidae, confirming recent work on the subfamily. Bombyliidae, as here defined to exclude genera traditionally placed in the Proratinae, is found to be monophyletic, however the evidence for its monophyly is weak. The subfamily Heterotropinae was found to be nested within the  Bombyliidae, thus the free-living, predatory habits of Heterotropus Loew larvae are interpreted as reversals from a parasitoid lifestyle rather than a primary plesiomorphic condition. In a reclassification of the Bombyliidae, 15 subfamilies are recognized: the Mythicomyiinae, Oligodraninae, Usiinae, Toxophorinae, Lordotinae new subfamily, Heterotropinae, Bombyliinae, Crocidiinae new statues, Mariobezziinae, Oniromyiinae, Cythereinae, Lomatiinae, Anthracinae, Tomomyzinae, and Antoniinae. The position of Sericosoma Macquart requires further research; it exhibits closest affinity with the Mariobezziinae. The proposed classification is conservative and reflects much of the structure of previous classifications. Chief differences include the recognition of the Gerontini and Systropodini as tribes of the Toxophorinae rather than separate subfamilies and the synonomy of the Cylleniinae within the Cythereinae. Crocidiinae is recognized as a subfamily, rather than a tribe of the Bombyliinae. Lordotinae is the only new family-level taxon proposed, characterized by the highly modified, telescoping female genitalia which are adapted for inserting the eggs into the substrate. Tribal divisions within the Bombyliinae, Lomatiinae, and Anthracinae are discussed. A key to the subfamilies of Bombyliidae is presented, and all subfamilies are diagnosed, synapomorphies listed, and their taxonomic scope, distribution, and biogeography briefly discussed. The fossil history of the Bombyliidae is discussed in relation to the cladogram. Bombyliidae probably originated in the Jurassic and had undergone much diversification at subfamily level by the end of the Cretaceous. The evolution of the bombyliid postcranium and female sand chamber is discussed in light of the cladogram. The evolution of the acanthophorites within the Bombyliidae is discussed in relation to the occurrence of this feature in other families of Asiloidea.

N2  - The previously monotypic subfamily Physogleninae Petrunkevitch is redefined to include Physoglenes Simon--containing P. vivesi Simon and three new species from Chile--and three new genera: Meringa, containing nine new species from New Zealand; Tupua, containing four new species from Tasmania; and Paratupua, containing one new species from Victoria. The physoglenine genera are united by unique modifications of the male pedicel and anterior abdominal region. The new subfamily Pahorinae is established for five new genera from New Zealand: Pahora (containing nine new species), Pahoroides (containing two new species), Wairua (containing two new species), Nomaua (containing five new species and N. crinifrons (Urquhart), transferred from the linyphiid genus Bolyphantes), and Runga (containing five new species). The pahorine genera are united by a carapace-abdomen stridulatory system, secretory pores on the male pars cephalica, and a deeply excavated paracymbial area on the male palp. Three other genera seem closely related to physoglenines and pahorines: Mangua, new genus, containing 13 new species and M. forsteri (Brignoli), transferred from Linyphia, all from New Zealand; Chileotaxus, new genus, containing one new species from Chile; and the Neotropical genus Synotaxus Simon. These spiders have been widely separated in some past classifications; Physoglenes has been variously considered a leptonetid, pholcid, theridiid, or araneoid incertae sedis, whereas the other previously described taxa have generally been considered theridiids or linyphiids. All 12 genera are united by the presence of a small, basally situated and dorsally excavated paracymbium, a longitudinal incision of the retrolateral cymbial margin, thickened (and sometimes spiniform) dorsal macrosetae on the male palpal femur, patella, and/or tibia, and greatly elongated, spineless legs, with the first pair much the longest and all femora basally thickened. The known web forms are diverse, including an irregular sheet (Mangua and at least some physoglenines), an inverted bowl (pahorines), and a latticelike structure (Synotaxus). The absence of a comb on tarsi IV and widened aggregate spigots on the posterior lateral spinnerets, and the presence of a basal paracymbium, indicate that these genera do not belong to the Theridiidae, and the male palpi lack the distinct embolic division including a radix typical of the Linyphiidae. The oldest family-group name available for the assemblage is Synotaxidae, based on Synotaxeae Simon. Synotaxidae is hypothesized to be the sister group of Nesticidae plus Theridiidae. Wunderlich's synonymy of the families Hadrotarsidae and Theridiidae appears to be justified by paracymbial morphology; two possibly monophyletic groups can be recognized among the genera that are currently considered valid members of those families. The genera Anatea Berland, Audifia Keyserling, Dipoena Thorell, Dipoenata Wunderlich, Euryopis Menge, Gmogola Keyserling, Guaraniella Baert, Hadrotarsus Thorell, Lasaeola Simon, and Yoroa Baert are apparently united by a suite of characters (a dorsoventrally flattened female palpal claw, shortened chelicerae with elongated fangs, specialized ventral setae on tarsus I, a series of parallel ridges on the medial surface of the anterior lateral spinnerets, and four rather than two spermathecae) and may all be specialized predators of ants; the earliest available name for the assemblage is Hadrotarsinae Thorell. At least the genera Anelosimus Simon, Chrosiothes Simon, Chrysso O.P.-Cambridge, Coleosoma O.P.-Cambridge, Helvibis Keyserling, Nesticodes Archer, Rugathodes Archer, Spintharus Hentz, Tekellina Levi, Theridula Emerton, Thwaitesia O.P.-Cambridge, and Thymoites Keyserling are apparently united by a distinctive paracymbial hood. The name Spintharinae Simon is available for this assemblage; if Spintharinae is monophyletic, the genera Achaearanea Strand and Anelosimus, as currently construed, may be polyphyletic assemblages that require relimitation.

T1  - Larval morphology of the Sepsidae (Diptera, Sciomyzoidea), with a cladistic analysis using adult and larval characters. 
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 228
SP  - 1
N2  - A phylogenetic hypothesis based on larval and adult characters is proposed for the Sepsidae. The cladistic analysis employed 85 characters and 57 taxa and found 16 equally parsimonious cladograms. The strict consensus tree and a preferred tree are presented, the region of the tree in which the parsimonious cladograms differ is indicated, and the competing arrangements of taxa are shown. Outgroup representatives included two species of ropalomerids (Ropalomera sp., Willistoniella pleuropunctata), two species of coelopids (Coelopa frigida, Chaetocoelopa sydneyensis), and one species of dryomyzid (Neuroctena caucasica). Based on larval characters, the Coelopidae are the sister group of the Sepsidae. Based on both the adult and the combined data sets, the Ropalomeridae, which are generally regarded as the sister group of the Sepsidae, are confirmed as their closest living relatives. Two new morphological autapormorphies related to the posterior spiracles are described for the Sepsidae. The following phylogenetic hypothesis is proposed based on the combined data set: (Orygma (Ortalischema (Paratoxopoda (Themira (Decachaetophora ((Saltella Susanomira) (Nemopoda (Lasionemopoda ((Meroplius Xenosepsis) (Palaeosepsis (Palaeosepsis (Parapalaeosepsis (Dicranosepsis (Sepsis (Australosepsis Sepsis)). The genus Xenosepsis is synonymized with Meroplius (syn. nov.), and the genus Australosepsis with Sepsis. The history of sepsid classification is briefly discussed, and the most influential systems are compared with the results of the cladistic analysis. The phylogenetic relationships of the genera for which the larvae are unknown are inferred from adult characters. Larvae for the following genera are described based on a comprehensive scanning electron microscopical study: Australosepsis (1 sp.), Decachaetophora (1 sp.), Dicranosepsis (1 sp.), Lasionemopoda (1 sp.), Meroplius (2 spp.), Nemopoda (3 spp.), Ortalischema (1 sp.), Orygma (1 sp.), Palaeosepsis (4 spp.), Parapalaeosepsis (2 spp.), Paratoxopoda (1 sp.), Saltella (3 spp.), Sepsis (20 spp.), Susanomira (1 sp.), Themira (10 spp.), and Xenosepsis. Except for two species of Nemopoda for which the cephalic region could not be studied, drawings of the following structures are supplied: cephalic region (ventral and lateral), maxillary palp, anterior spiracle, ventral creeping welt, last segment (ventral, lateral, and dorsal), and spiracular plate of the posterior spiracle. Keys are presented that allow the identification of all genera and most species within the genera. However, the morphological differences between some species within Sepsis and Themira are so subtle that species identifications are difficult or even impossible. The literature on larval morphology, biology, and distribution of the species is briefly summarized.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 199
SP  - 1
N2  - The present work is the first attempt to unite all the genera of the Melanolophiini in one paper, and to give a revision of the tribe. The males can be recognized by the following group of characters: antennae pectinate, with the pectinations arising basally on their segments; abdomens are variously modified, usually having the intersegmental membrane between A3 and A4 ventrolaterally with either an invagination on each side, some with a small projecting setal tuft, or a large, very prominent double setal tuft, plus a prominent comblike paired structure of elongate, apically flattened scales on the intersegmental membrane between A7 and A8 (although this may be reduced to a flattened sclerotized band and a few setae); the inner face of the valves is never simple, having a variably developed sacculus, often in the form of a spinose process or an elongate free arm, and/or a swollen, sclerotized, spinose harpe. The females have the signum reduced or absent; otherwise they have to be associated with their males for tribal placement. The early stages of only a very few species are known; these are characterized in the mature larva by having seta SDX2 in the subdorsal region of the anterior abdominal segments, and with all the crochets of the prolegs being in one group. The Melanolophiini are restricted to the New World, where the species range from southern Alaska to southern South America. A few are known from both the Greater and Lesser Antilles, but the group is not known from Chile. Fifteen genera are recognized; Antiphoides, Arilophia, Minyolophia, Segalenara, and Tesiophora are described as new. All genera are completely described, with the adults and the genitalia of both sexes illustrated; a key to the males is provided. For some genera only brief references are made to the included species, while in others complete generic revisions are presented, with diagnoses of the previously described species and descriptions of new taxa. Included in the latter category are Anavinemina Rindge, Galenara McDunnough, and Vinemina McDunnough, as well as the newly described genera. Fifty-two new species are described. These include Anavinemina acomos, A. brachiata, A. evexa, A. lunaris, A. semicircula, A. striola, A. wellingi, Arilophia rawlinsi, Astalotesia hollandi, Carphoides durango, C. oaxaca, Galenara antilectos, G. bispicula, G. carina, G. engonios, G. ferrugina, G. leberasae, G. phoxe, G. tlaxcala, G. vernonae, Melanolophia anchicaya, M. calimae, M. mima, M. muriensis, M. necopina, M. orthogonia, M. ovata,  M. peridoxa, M. plecte, M. pseudoxa, M. sullivani, Pherotesia dystactos, P. garka, P. inhamata, P. obunca, P. pedaria, P. quadra, P. ralla, Minyolophia distincta, M. hadra, M. inermis, M. parilis, M. prolixa, M. yanayacu, Tesiophora aquila, T. cerezal, T. entephros, T. exallos, T. orthe, T. pulla, Vinemina digita, and V. olivaria. These 52 new species bring the number in this tribe to just under 200; almost one-half are placed in Melanolophia. Six new combinations are proposed: Anavinemina rindgei (Beutelspacher), Antiphoides errantaria (McDunnough), A. dentata (Dyar), Minyolophia azenioides (Herbulot), Segalenara phyararia (Dyar), and Tesiophora humidaria (Schaus). There is one new status, as Pherotesia minuisca Rindge is raised to species rank.

N2  - This paper presents a phylogenetic analysis of the Asteropyginae Delo, 1935. Sixty-six characters and 39 taxa were employed in a cladistic analysis that produced a single most parsimonious tree that is presented as a hypothesis of asteropyginid relationships. In addition to the phylogeny generated, 11 new genera are diagnosed: Philipsmithiana, Coltraneia, Stummiana, Bellacartwrightia, Deloops, Tolkienia, Braunops, Armorigreenops, Kennacryphaeus, Modellops, and Hallandclarkeops, and 12 new species are described: Philipsmithiana hyfinkeli, P. burtandmimiae, Armorigreenops leoi, Pelitlina smeenki, Bellacartwrightia jennyae, B. whiteleyi, B. phyllocaudata, B. calderonae, Greenops widderensis, G. barberi, G. grabaui, and Kennacryphaeus harrisae. Traditionally, asteropyginine taxa in the Appalachian and Michigan Basins of Eastern North America had been assigned to Greenops Delo, 1935, or Greenops (Neometacanthus) Richter and Richter, 1948. A core of five Eastern North American species--Greenops boothi (Green, 1837), G. widderensis, new species, G. chilmanae Stumm, 1965, G. grabaui, new species, and G. barberi, new species--can still be assigned to Greenops. All other asteropyginine taxa in Eastern North America must be assigned to different genera. Species referable to Neometacanthus Richter and Richter, 1948, may be known from the Illinois Basin of Eastern North America, and a species referable to Tolkienia, new genus, may be known from the Michigan Basin of Eastern North America. The single most parsimonious cladogram was also used to investigate biogeographic patterns. In particular, the number of times that independent lineages of asteropyginines invaded from what are now Europe and North Africa (called Armorica herein) into Eastern North America during the Devonian was ascertained. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that there must have been at least four such invasions, with clades that had primitive European or North African affinities giving rise to Eastern North American taxa, although no species are shared between Armorica and Eastern North America. One of the lineages that invaded Eastern North America subsequently reinvaded Armorica. The timing of these invasions and their relation to overall patterns of faunal evolution in the Middle Devonian of Eastern North America are also discussed. These patterns suggest that the different taxa that make up a fauna often arrive during different time intervals, not all at once.

T1  - Phylogeny and revision of the Anchomenus clade : the genera Tetraleucus, Anchomenus, Sericoda, and Elliptoleus (Coleoptera, Carabidae, Platynini).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 202
SP  - 1
N2  - Taxa comprising the Anchomenus clade within the carabid tribe Platynini, subtribe Platyni, possess the synapomorphy of a female spermatheca with a basal reservoir and a long apical filament. As presently constituted, this clade comprises 29 species arrayed in four genera; the monotypic Tetraleucus Casey in eastern North America, the Holarctic Anchomenus Bonelli with 10 species, the Holarctic Sericoda Kirby with 7 species, and the Mexican Elliptoleus Bates with 11 species. Seven species are newly described; Anchomenus capensis, n. sp. from Baja California Sur, Sericoda montana, n. sp. from Cuba, Elliptoleus corvus, n. sp. from México state, Elliptoleus zapotecorum, n. sp. from Oaxaca, Elliptoleus whiteheadi, n. sp. from Guerrero, Elliptoleus balli, n. sp. from Jalisco and Michoacan, and Elliptoleus tequilae, n. sp. from Jalisco. New combinations proposed include: Tetraleucus picticornis Newman (removed from Agonum Bonelli); Anchomenus virescens Motschulsky (removed from Chlaeniomimus Semenow, 1889, as that generic name is a new synonym of Anchomenus Bonelli, 1810); Anchomenus yukihikoi (removed from Agonum (Nipponanchus) Habu, 1978, as that subgeneric name is a new synonym of Anchomenus); Sericoda ceylonica (removed from Agonum Bonelli), and Sericoda lissoptera (removed from Anchomenus Bonelli). Species-level names placed into synonymy within Anchomenus, followed by their respective senior synonyms, include: Dohrni diana Sahlberg = dohrnii Fairmaire, discophorus Chaudoir = dorsalis Pontoppidan, cyaneus asturicus Heinz = cyaneus Dejean, gracilicollis Jakowleff = virescens Motschulsky. Batenus? borealis Motschulsky is removed from synonymy under Sericoda bogemannii, and is recognized as a junior synonym of Agonum consimile Gyllenhal. Lectotypes are designated for Anchomenus dohrnii diana Sahlberg, Anchomenus virescens Motschulsky, A. leucopus Bates, A. funebris LeConte, Sericoda lissoptera Chaudoir, S. ceylonica Motschulsky, Elliptoleus acutesculptus Bates, E. olisthopoides Bates, E. curtulus Bates, E. vixstriatus Bates, E. luteipes Csiki, and E. crepericornis Bates. A cladistic hypothesis of the phylogenetic relationships among the species is formulated based on 65 potential synapomorphies of adults, represented by 54 characters. The genera Sericoda and Elliptoleus are hypothesized as sister genera, with Anchomenus their sister group. Tetraleucus is the outgroup for the rest of the clade. The amount of character evolution is heterogeneous across the clade, with significantly less anagenetic change per internode of the cladogram within Elliptoleus compared to its sister group Sericoda. Elliptoleus species possess limited powers of dispersal and exhibit very restricted geographic ranges, whereas Sericoda species readily fly and possess some of the largest geographic ranges observed within Carabidae. Thus, relatively less anagenetic change is associated  with speciation in the less vagile more endemic Elliptoleus, and extensive anagenesis occurs during the history of the vagile, widespread Sericoda species. First-instar larvae of 6 of the 29 species are described, and a cladistic hypothesis of relationships based on six larval characters is proposed. This hypothesis supports the monophyly of the sister genera Sericoda and Elliptoleus, but is otherwise discordant with the cladistic hypothesis based on adult characters. Autapomorphies of the first-instar larvae of the six taxa are listed in order to facilitate comparison of derived states in newly discovered larvae. The biogeographic patterns within the individual genera are analyzed using cladistic biogeographic methodology. The entire clade is hypothesized as Eocene in age, with the basal taxon Tetraleucus isolated from Old World progenitors of the rest of the clade due to amphi-Atlantic vicariance. Anchomenus is divisable into two clades; four New World species distributed along the Pacific coast from Alaska to Baja California, and six Old World species distributed from Japan to western Europe. Beringian vicariance in the Miocene is the likely cause of this pattern. Sericoda species exhibit a collective Holarctic distribution, with one species found in montane regions of southeast Asia and Indomalaya. Beringian vicariance has occurred at least twice during the diversification of the seven species leading to divergence of: (1) S. ceylonica from its sister group of S. bembidioides plus S. montana, (2) the sister species S. bogemannii and S. obsoleta. These vicariant events are hypothesized to have occurred in late Miocene or Pliocene times. Elliptoleus was probably isolated in México from its more northern sister group, Sericoda, in late Miocene. Cladistic biogeographic analysis allows derivation of a fundamental area cladogram for the temperate humid montane forest habitats occupied by Elliptoleus species. The Sierra Madre Occidental is hypothesized as the sister area of the Transvolcanic Sierra plus the more southerly Sierra de Oaxaca and Sierra Madre del Sur. Biotic connections of the Transvolcanic Sierra with montane regions to the south are via a filter bridge along the Atlantic versant, running from Pico de Orizaba to the Sierra de Oaxaca. Divergence events at the species level are geographically associated with river valleys, or regions of geological uplift near major volcanoes.

N2  - We establish that Abronia vasconcelosii is a junior synonym of A. aurita. Abronia fimbriata is resurrected from the synonymy of A. aurita and shown to be one of the most distinctive species in the genus. Abronia gaiophantasma and A. anzuetoi are described, respectively, from the cloud forest of the western Sierra de las Minas, Department of Baja Verapaz, Guatemala, and the southern (Pacific) slope of the Volcán de Agua, Department of Escuintla, Guatemala. These species had previously been confused with A. aurita and 'A. vasconcelosii,' Respectively. Abronia smithi, a new species from the Pacific versant of Chiapas, Mexico, and A. leurolepis, a new species from the Atlantic versant of Chiapas, Mexico, are described and distinguished from A. ochoterenai, from the Atlantic versant of Chiapas, Mexico, with which they had previously been confused. A more detailed diagnosis of A. matudai, of the Pacific versant of Guatemala and Chiapas, Mexico, is provided. Abronia kalaina is placed in the synonymy of A. fuscolabialis, and specimens previously reported as A. montecristoi from Honduras are shown to be representatives of A. salvadorensis. We address the taxonomic history and provide synonymies and diagnoses for each of the problematical species. The natural history, conservation biology, and phylogeny of Abronia are discussed. The use of intraspecifically variable characters in phylogenetic inference is addressed and alternative approaches to analysis are compared: (1) a reference approach in which only 'fixed' characters are employed (i.e., all transformation series that contain polymorphic cells in the data matrix are excluded); (2) a 'baseline' approach in which polymorphisms are optimized onto the resulting cladograms, but polymorphism is not allowed on interior stems; (3) an 'any instance' approach in which only a priori apomorphies are coded, regardless of frequency; (4) an 'unscaled,' minimum turnover approach in which all character matches count equally a priori and origination of apomorphies is minimized; and (5) a 'scaled' approach in which the transformation diameter from 'fixed' plesiomorphy direct to 'fixed' apomorphy is the same as from 'fixed' plesiomorphy to 'variable' within a terminal taxon to 'fixed' apomorphy. A priori weighting of characters that exhibit no intrapopulational polymorphism over those showing polymorphism is done in order to evaluate the signal inherent in intraspecifically variable characters as well as characterization problems. Successive approximations is evaluated as a means of increasing the signal to noise ratio in data analysis. The technique recommended for incorporating intraspecifically variable morphological characters into a phylogenetic analysis is an unscaled, minimum turnover approach, combined with successive approximations.

T1  - History and nomenclature of avian family-group names.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 222
SP  - 1
N2  - The Standing Committee on Ornithological Nomenclature chaired by Walter Bock undertook an analysis ofthe nomenclatural history of avian family-group names. The primary results are (1) the establishment of a complete list of avian family-group names with authors, dates, and citations to the original papers, (2) discussion of problem family-group names, (3) an index to avian family-group names, (4) a historical analysis of avian family-group nomenclature, and (5) a historical analysis of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature as it related to family-group nomenclature. The second result is the basis for an application to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature to adopt formally the presented list of avian family-group names as the official baseline dated 1 January 1994 for all future nomenclatural decisions relating to avian family-group names. Third is the use of this historical survey of avian family-group names as a test case to demonstrate the suitability of regulations in the Code pertaining to family-group names in the absence, as well as in the availability, of full historical knowledge of family-group names in a larger taxon. It is shown that these regulations are not workable without a detailed knowledge of nomenclatural history, and because such histories are not available for most groups of animals, current regulations in the Code pertaining to family-group names are not workable. Lastly, recommendations are offered for modifications in the rules of zoological nomenclature to achieve greater continuity, stability, and universality of family-group names without the need for complete historical investigations of these names in each group of animals. These suggestions include establishment of stare decisis clauses and of base-line lists of family-group for family-group names for each group of animals.

T1  - Systematic studies of oryzomyine rodents (Muridae, Sigmodontinae) : a synopsis of Microryzomys.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 191
SP  - 1
N2  - The genus Microryzomys contains certain small-bodied, long-tailed oryzomyine rodents that are endemic to the northern and central Andes, their distribution describing an arc from northern Venezuela, through Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, to central Bolivia. Based on the examination of over 900 museum specimens representing 105 principal collecting localities, two species, without subspecific divisions, are recognized: M. minutus (dryas Thomas, d. humilior Thomas, fulvirostris Allen, and aurillus Thomas in synonomy) and M. altissimus (a. hylaeus Hershkovitz and a. chotanus Hershkovitz in synonomy). Microryzomys minutus can be distinguished from its congener altissimus by a combination of size and proportional differences, which were underscored in principal component analysis of 16 craniodental and 3 external variables using representative population samples of each species. These results, together with 14 locality records of  sympatry (or parapatry) in the mountains of Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, support an interpretation of only two biological species. Populations of Microryzomys altissimus are more restricted geographically, altitudinally, and perhaps ecologically than are those of M. minutus. The geographic limits of M. minutus define the  distributional boundaries of the genus, whereas, M. altissimus occurs only in the Cordillera Central of Colombia, throughout the Andes of Ecuador, to the highlands of central Peru. Locality records document that M. altissimus occupies a higher altitudinal zone (mostly from 2500 to 4000 m) compared to M. minutus (mostly from 1500 to 3500 m); most instances of sympatry occur within the 2500 to 3500 m interval. Information gleaned from specimen tags and fieldnotes suggests that the two species inhabit different morphoclimatic vegetation zones consistent with the altitudinal belts they occupy. Microryzomys minutus dwells in a variety of wet, cool Andean forests ranging from lower and upper montane rain forest to subalpine rain forest; at its upper altitudinal limits, it may frequent various habitats found at the ecotone between upper Andean forests and páramo. Microryzomys altissimus is more regularly associated with páramo environments, the forest-páramo  ecotone, and subalpine rain forest. Both species range on either side of the Huancabamba Depression in northern Peru without evidence of appreciable differentiation. Neither species penetrates the Altiplano biome in southern Peru and Bolivia; the southernmost distribution of M. minutus adheres to wet forest along Amazon-facing slopes east of the Altiplano. Examination of external, cranial, dental and gastric morphology revealed a suite of qualitative traits, apparently unrelated to overall size, by which species of Microryzomys can be distinguished from those of Oligoryzomys and from Oryzomys palustris, the type species of Oryzomys. The concordance of these discrete character states contradicts the notion that Microryzomys and Oligoryzomys are artificial constructs used to segregate the smaller species within a speciose genus highly varied in body size. Instead, such character associations support the monophyly of species assigned to Microryzomys and to Oligoryzomys relative to other groups of oryzomine rodents. Emended diagnoses, framed at the generic level, are provided for these two taxa. Evaluation of 20 qualitative characters reveals that Oryzomys palustris is highly differentiated from both Microryzomys and Oligoryzomys, which share many traits thought to be plesiomorphic. Certain derived character states suggest that Microryzomys and Oligoryzomys are sister taxa, but the evidence for a close relationship is weak, and this possibility must await further corroboration and the study of a broader array of oryzomines.

T1  - Revision of the subtribe Cylindroxystina (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Paederinae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 203
SP  - 1
N2  - The Neotropical tribe Cylindroxystini is reduced to a subtribe, Cylindroxystina, of the Paederini. Cylindroxystina is distinguished from all other subtribes of the Paederinae by the sickle-shaped, edentate mandibles, nipple-shaped fourth segment of the maxillary palpus, single pair of paratergites of abdominal segment III, and cylindrical abdomen. The paratergites of segments IV to VI are absent, the tergum and sternum of each segment are fused, and the segment is cylindrical. Segment VII also lacks paratergites, but the tergum and sternum remain separate. Two genera, Cylindroxystus and Neolindus, are included in the subtribe. For Cylindroxystus, 2 species, pluviosus and borinquense, both from the Caribbean, are transferred from Lobrathium and 11 new species are described as follows: crenus, flavus, luridus, and sinuosus from Ecuador; furvus and messus from Peru; alleni and redactus from Panama; lyrus from Venezuela; concavoperculum from Guyana; and cavus from Brazil. Cylindroxystus is distinguished from Neolindus by the third antennal segment that is cupulate or has a carina surrounding the apex. Twenty-seven new species are described in Neolindus as follows: agilis, brewsterae, densus, hamatus, lodhii, sinuatus, and unilobus from Brazil; cephalochymus from Peru; bidens, bullus, dichymus, lirellus, milleri, parallelus, procarinatus, prolatus, and retusus from Ecuador; pumicosus from Colombia; brachiatus, plectrus, and rudiculus from Venezuela; apiculus, basisinuatus, campbelli, and punctogularis from Panama; and cuneatus and incanalis from Costa Rica. Neolindus is separated from Cylindroxystus by the presence of one or two pairs of cephalic trichobothria which are lacking in Cylindroxystus. Until now Cylindroxystus was known only by one specimen from Costa Rica, and Neolindus by a few specimens from Brazil and Peru. The subtribe is redescribed and both genera and all the species are described and  illustrated and their phylogenetic relationships discussed. Keys to the males of both genera are provided. Most of the present work is based on characteristics of the male. Females were unavailable for over half of the species, and it was not always possible to reliably associate the sexes. Species of both genera have been collected rarely and most seem to have been collected from leaf litter on the forest floor at some distance from streams.

T1  - Phylogenetic relationships of Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycteris, and Palaeochiropteryx to extant bat lineages, with comments on the evolution of echolocation and foraging strategies in Microchiroptera.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 235
SP  - 1
N2  - The Eocene fossil record of bats (Chiroptera) includes four genera known from relatively complete skeletons: Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycteris, and Palaeochiropteryx. Phylogenetic relationships of these taxa to each other and to extant lineages of bats were investigated in a parsimony analysis of 195 morphological characters, 12 rDNA restriction site characters, and one character based on the number of R-1 tandem repeats in the mtDNA d-loop region. Results indicate that Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycteris, and Palaeochiropteryx represent a series of consecutive sister-taxa to extant microchiropteran bats. This conclusion stands in contrast to previous suggestions that these fossil forms represent either a primitive grade ancestral to both Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera (e.g., Eochiroptera) or a separate clade within Microchiroptera (e.g., Palaeochiropterygoidea). A new higher-level classification is proposed to better reflect hypothesized relationships among Eocene fossil bats and extant taxa. Critical features of this classification include restriction of Microchiroptera to the smallest clade that includes all extant bats that use sophisticated echolocation (Emballonuridae + Yinochiroptera + Yangochiroptera), and formal recognition of two more inclusive clades that encompass Microchiroptera plus the four fossil genera. Comparisons of results of separate phylogenetic analyses including and subsequently excluding the fossil taxa indicate that inclusion of the fossils changes the results in two ways: (1) altering perceived relationships among extant forms at a few poorly supported nodes; and (2) reducing perceived support for some nodes near the base of the tree. Inclusion of the fossils affects some character polarities (hence slightly changing tree topology), and also changes the levels at which transformations appear to apply (hence altering perceived support for some clades). Results of an additional phylogenetic analysis in which soft-tissue and molecular characters were excluded from consideration indicate that these characters are critical for determination of relationships among extant lineages. Our phylogeny provides a basis for evaluating previous hypotheses on the evolution of flight, echolocation, and foraging strategies. We propose that flight evolved before echolocation, and that the first bats used vision for orientation in their arboreal/aerial environment. The evolution of flight was followed by the origin of low-duty-cycle laryngeal echolocation in early members of the microchiropteran lineage. This system was most likely simple at first, permitting orientation and obstacle detection but not detection or tracking of airborne prey. Owing to the mechanical coupling of ventilation and flight, the energy costs of echolocation to flying bats were relatively low. In contrast, the benefits of aerial insectivory were substantial, and a more sophisticated low-duty-cycle echolocation system capable of detecting, tracking, and assessing airborne prey subsequently evolved rapidly. The need for an increasingly derived auditory system, together with limits on body size imposed by the mechanics of flight, echolocation, and prey capture, may have resulted in reduction and simplification of the visual system as echolocation became increasingly important. Our analysis confirms previous suggestions that Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris, Hassianycteris, and Palaeochiropteryx used echolocation. Foraging strategies of these forms were reconstructed based on postcranial osteology and wing form, cochlear size, and stomach contents. In the context of our phylogeny, we suggest that foraging behavior in the microchiropteran lineage evolved in a series of steps: (1) gleaning food objects during short flights from a perch using vision for orientation and obstacle detection; prey detection by passive means, including vision and/or listening for prey-generated sounds (no known examples in fossil record); (2) gleaning stationary prey from a perch using echolocation and vision for orientation and obstacle detection; prey detection by passive means (Icaronycteris, Archaeonycteris); (3) perch hunting for both stationary and flying prey using echolocation and vision for orientation and obstacle detection; prey detection and tracking using echolocation for flying prey and passive means for stationary prey (no known example, although Icaronycteris and/or Archaeonycteris may have done this at times); (4) combined perch hunting and continuous aerial hawking using echolocation and vision for orientation and obstacle detection; prey detection and tracking using echolocation for flying prey and passive means for stationary prey; calcar-supported uropatagium used for prey capture (common ancestor of Hassianycteris and Palaeochiropteryx; retained in Palaeochiropteryx); (5) exclusive reliance on continuous aerial hawking using echolocation and vision for orientation and obstacle detection; prey detection and tracking using echolocation (Hassianycteris; common ancestor of Microchiroptera). The transition to using echolocation to detect and track prey would have been difficult in cluttered environments owing to interference produced by multiple returning echoes. We therefore propose that this transition occurred in bats that foraged in forest gaps and along the edges of lakes and rivers in situations where potential perch sites were adjacent to relatively clutter-free open spaces. Aerial hawking using echolocation to detect, track, and evaluate prey was apparently the primitive foraging strategy for Microchiroptera. This implies that gleaning, passive prey detection, and perch hunting among extant microchiropterans are secondarily derived specializations rather than retentions of primitive habits. Each of these habits has apparently evolved multiple times. The evolution of continuous aerial hawking may have been the 'key innovation' responsible for the burst of diversification in microchiropteran bats that occurred during the Eocene. Fossils referable to six major extant lineages are known from middle-late Eocene deposits, and reconstruction of ghost lineages leads to the conclusion that at least seven more extant lineages were minimally present by the end of the Eocene.

T1  - Taxonomic revision of the Lysorophia, Permo-Carboniferous lepospondyl amphibians.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 209
SP  - 1
N2  - The Lysorophia is an order of small, but extremely elongate and tiny-limbed aquatic lepospondyl amphibians known from the Middle Pennsylvanian through the Lower Permian periods, primarily in North America. The order comprises one family, Cocytinidae, with three recognized species: Brachydectes newberryi (= Cocytinus gyrinoides), B. elongatus (= Lysorophus tricarinatus, partim), and Pleuroptyx clavatus. Other named species are considered Lysorophia, incertae sedis. Members of the Lysorophia are distinguished by their fenestrate skulls, anteriorly sloping suspensoria, short mandibles (each bearing a lateral mandibular fenestra), and extensive, well-ossified hyobranchial skeletons. Presacral vertebrae are holospondylous and number between 69 (B. newberryi) and 97 (B. Elongatus). Neural arch halves are sutured at their midlines and to their centra. While closely similar to one another, lysorophoid species are highly derived relative to other Paleozoic amphibians. They are most closely related to microsaurs, judged principally through the morphology of the craniovertebral articulation.

T1  - A revision of the funnelweb mygalomorph spider subfamily Ischnothelinae (Araneae, Dipluridae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 226
SP  - 1
N2  - The tropical diplurid spider subfamily Ischnothelinae is revised for the first time. The monophyly of this subfamily is supported by six putative synapomorphies: an elongate cymbial apophysis, two rows of cheliceral teeth, a procurved transverse fovea, collariform trichobothrial bases, fused silk spigots, and long, tapering, pseudosegmented terminal posterior lateral spinneret articles. Five genera are recognized: Ischnothele Ausserer (with 11 species in South America, Central America, and the Antilles), Andethele, new genus (with 3 species in the Andes Mountains of Peru), Lathrothele Benoit (with 4 species in Africa), Indothele, new genus (with 4 species in India and Sri Lanka), and Thelechoris Karsch (with 2 species in Africa and Madagascar). Phylogenies (based on cladistic analyses using two different sets of outgroups), biogeographic hypotheses, a key, diagnoses, descriptions, tables of quantitative character values, illustrations, analyses of variation, natural history information, locality records, and distribution maps are presented for the 24 recognized species. The cladistic analyses provide strong support for the monophyly of the Old World branch of the subfamily, the genera Andethele and Thelechoris, and the Greater Antillean and South American (goloboffi) clades of Ischnothele, and weaker or ambiguous support for the monophyly of Ischnothele, Lathrothele, and Indothele. Ten species are newly described: Ischnothele jeremie, I. garcia, I. huambisa, and I. goloboffi; Andethele lucma, A. huanca, and A. tarma; Indothele lanka, I. rothi, and I. mala. Fourteen specific names are newly synonymized: Ischnothele ecuadorensis Schmidt with Ischnothele digitata (O.P.-Cambridge); Entomothele pusilla Simon, Thelechoris zebrina Simon, Thelechoris funesta Fischel, Thelechoris obtusa Fischel, and Ischnothele sexpunctata Bücherl, da Costa, and Lucas with Ischnothele caudata Ausserer; Ischnothele siemensi F.O.P.-Cambridge with Ischnothele guianensis (Walckenaer); Ischnothele indigens Vellard, Ischnothele zorodes Mello-Leitão, Ischnothele campestris Schiapelli and Gerschman, Ischnothele affinis Schiapelli and Gerschman, and Ischnothele cranwelli Gerschman and Schiapelli with Ischnothele annulata Tullgren; Lathrothele marmoratus Benoit with Lathrothele grabensis Benoit; and Thelechoris karschi Bösenberg and Lenz with Thelechoris striatipes (Simon). Several species previously placed in ischnotheline genera are not ischnothelines: Ischnothele annectens (Bertkau), Ischnothele simplicata Saito, Ischnothele strandi Spassky, Ischnothele lineata (Karsch), Ischnothele indicola Tikader, and Thelechoris australis Purcell. Evidence is presented that suggests that Ischnothele longicauda and Lathrothele grabensis may each consist of more than one species and that Thelechoris rutenbergi and T. striatipes may be conspecific.

VL  - 200
SP  - 1
N2  - The taxonomy of the New World Encicocephalidae is treated in detail at the generic and specific level with the exception of Systelloderes Blanchard, for which only the genus is diagnosed. The tribe Systelloderini is resurrected to contain the genus Systelloderes within the Encicocephalinae. The new genera Chiricocoris, Lysenicocephalus, Neoncylocotis, Urnacephala, and Xenicocephalus are described. Thirty-eight new species are described in 9 genera. Enicocephalus marimutti Kritsky and E. yvonneae Kritsky are treated as junior synonyms of E. cubanus Barber; E. emarginatus Champion is treated as a junior synonym of E. pilosus Champion; Oncylocotis braziliensis Kritsky is treated as a junior synonym of Neoncylocotis stannardi (Kritsky). Several new combinations are created, particularly for species transferred to the genus Neoncylocotis. Keys are provided for all genera except Xenicocephalus, and for all species except those of Systelloderes. General reviews are provided for the following subject areas: biology; somatic structures and diagnostic characters; and genitalia, homologies, and the phylogeny of the New World taxa. Scanning electron microscopy is used intensively for the study of morphological structure, and the results in the form of micrographs are presented in conjunction with numerous line drawings.

T1  - Phylogenetic systematics of the Hesperocyoninae (Carnivora, Canidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 221
SP  - 1
N2  - The subfamily Hesperocyoninae includes the oldest and most primitive members of the Canidae. It has a geological range from late Eocene (Duchesnean) to middle Miocene (early Barstovian), lasting more than 20 million years. Representatives of the Hesperocyoninae are known only in North America. Initial diversification of the Hesperocyoninae began in the Orellan, and by the Whitneyan, all of its main lineages were in place. It achieved a maximum diversity of 14 species in the early Arikareean. The present study describes the extraordinary fossil canids from the Frick Collection. It contains many new taxa that provide new insight into the phylogeny of the hesperocyonines, and also more complete materials of known forms that allow better assessments of morphological variations. Besides the basal canid Prohesperocyon, a total of 10 genera and 26 species of hesperocyonines are recognized; among these, 4 genera and 8 species are new. A phylogenetic analysis is performed using cladistic methodology, with Miacis as an outgroup. Four major lineages can be defined on the basis of shared derived characters: the Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade, the Osbornodon clade, the Paraenhydrocyon clade, and the Ectopocynus clade. The latter three clades are newly recognized, although some of their included species had previously been referred to various other taxa. In addition, a monotypic Caedocyon probably forms a  distinct clade of its own. Hesperocyon occupies the central position of possibly being ancestral to many of the lineages. Its lack of shared derived characters, however, precludes it from being closely linked to any particular derived clade, although there is evidence that the Paraenhydrocyon clade may be directly descendant from H. gregarius. A new, large-sized Hesperocyon ('H.' coloradensis) provides an important link between H. gregarius and the Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade. The Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade is the most diverse lineage of hesperocyonines and includes 10 species. Mesocyon and Cynodesmus, two medium-sized genera with numerous species previously referred to, are now restricted to include two species each. Sunkahetanka and Philotrox represent two transitional taxa leading to the hypercarnivorous Enhydrocyon. Trends within this lineage include elongation of the posterior portion of the skull so that the rostrum appears to be short, enlargement of carnassials, and increasingly robust premolars. Materials of a large species from mostly the Frick Collection lead to the recognition of a new genus and species Osbornodon fricki. Four additional species are referred to the genus, three of them having been previously described (O. sesnoni, O. iamonensis, and O. brachypus) and one new species (O. renjiei) being the most primitive of the genus. Osbornodon is the only genus of the Hesperocyoninae that developed a basined talonid in the lower molars and long upper molars, features paralleling those of the Borophaginae and Caninae. In addition, Osbornodon has an elongated rostrum and an extensive frontal sinus (in derived species), a combination of characteristics also seen in the Caninae. A sister-group relationship between the Osbornodon clade and the Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade is suggested by their common possession of a ventrally directed paroccipital process. The three species presently referred to Paraenhydrocyon (a new genus) were previously included in Mesocyon, and now form a clade of their own. In addition to its retention of several primitive cranial characters, Paraenhydrocyon, with its unique slender, sharp-tipped premolars, clearly contrasts with the robust premolars of the Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade. Paraenhydrocyon does, however, parallel the Mesocyon-Enhydrocyon clade in having a reduced metaconid of the lower molars. Represented by a single partial cranium, Caedocyon is a highly apomorphic form, with enlarged, caniniform upper third incisors, shortened upper premolars, and reduced upper molars. Its phylogenetic position is not clear, although its simple, high premolars and the precision of its occlusion suggest affinity with Paraenhydrocyon. Ectopocynus (new genus with three species, all from the Frick Collection) is mainly characterized by its simple, robust, and blunt premolars, and approaches many of the characteristics of Enhydrocyon, such as massive premolars and reduced or lost metaconid on lower molars. Materials of Ectopocynus are limited to mandibles and teeth only. Its unknown cranial anatomy does not permit a firm answer about its phylogenetic affinity, although a primitive member of this lineage (Ec. antiquus) suggests affinity with the Hesperocyon-like forms of the Whitneyan. Hesperocyoninae, as presently defined, is likely a paraphyletic taxon. The subfamily may be characterized by possession of a trenchant talonid of lower first molars, in contrast to basined talonids in the Borophaginae and Caninae. The trenchant talonid, however, is clearly primitive for the Hesperocyoninae (and also for the family Canidae), and no synapomorphy is found to support a monophyletic Hesperocyoninae. The paraphyly of the Hesperocyoninae is also sugested by its primitive genus Hesperocyon, which is probably ancestral to both borophagines and canines. Evolutionary trends in hesperocyonines include repeated tendencies toward hypercarnivory, involving large body size, strong cranial construction, robust premolars, and increasing length of carnassials. Such tendencies can be observed in nearly all of the clades, although each has a different combination of these tendencies and achieves different degrees of hypercarnivory. Truly hypocarnivorous taxa, on the other hand, did not develop as in Borophaginae and Caninae.

VL  - 196
SP  - 1
N2  - The subfamily Phyxelidinae Lehtinen of the Amaurobiidae is diagnosed and revised, and a key to and distribution maps of the 53 valid and 1 undescribed species are provided. The subfamily comprises 12 genera placed in three newly described tribes: Ambohima, new genus, Kulalania new genus, Lamaika, new genus, Malaika Lehtinen, Matundua Lehtinen, Namaquarachne, new genus, Phyxelida Simon, Pongolania, new genus, Themacrys Simon, Vidole Lehtinen, Vytfutia Deeleman-Reinhold, and Xevioso Lehtinen. Vytfutia is newly transferred to the Phyxelidinae. Members of the Phyxelidinae occur in Africa, Madagascar, the eastern Mediterranean, and southeast Asia. The Phyxelidinae is monophyletic and is defined by the following putative synapomorphies: at least some of the basal prolateral setae on the palpal femora of both sexes are enlarged, and in many species the setae are also modified into thorns; the tarsal trichobothria are lost and the metatarsal pattern is reduced to a single subapical dorsal trichobothrium; and the origin of the calamistrum is shifted to the median part of the fourth metatarsus. Previous familial placements of the spiders here placed in the Phyxelidinae are critically evaluated, and it is concluded that the Phyxelidinae are members of the Amaurobiidae. The Amaurobiidae is redefined on the basis of putative synapomorphies as spiders with a divided cribellum which have simple, sclerotized retrolateral and dorsal tibial processes on the male palp (however, the retrolateral process is lost in all Phyxelidinae except Vytfutia). A cladogram for the 54 species of the Phyxelidinae derived through numerical parsimony analysis using Swofford's program PAUP is presented. The following new taxa are proposed: new tribes: Vytfutiini, Vidoleini, and Phyxelidini; new genera: Ambohima (type species Ambohima sublima, new species, from Madagascar), Kulalania (type species Kulalania antiqua, new species, from Kenya), Lamaika (type species Lamaika distincta, new species, from South Africa), Namaquarachne (type species Namaquarachne khoikhoiana, new species, from South Africa), and Pongolania (type species Pongolania pongola, new species, from South Africa); new species: Ambohima sublima and A. pauliani; Kulalania antiqua; Lamaika distincta; Malaika delicatula; Namaquarachne angulata, N. khoikhoiana, N. thaumatula, and N. tropata; Phyxelida abyssinica, P. anatolica, P. apwania, P. carcharata, P. crassibursa, P. eurygyna, P. fanivelona, P. irwini, P. jabalina, P. kipia, P. malagasyana P. pingoana, P. sindanoa, and P. umlima; Pongolania chrysionaria and P. pongola; Themacrys ukhahlamba; Vidole V. helicigyna, V. lyra, and V. sothoana; Xevioso amica, X. aululata, X. colobata, X. jocquei, X. kulufa, X. lichmadina, and X. orthomeles. The following new synonymies are proposed: Haemilla grindleyi Lawrence with Malaika longipes (Purcell); Haemilla profundissima Lawrence with Vidole capensis (Pocock). The synonymies of Auximus schreineri Purcell with Auximus capensis Pocock, and of Haemilla tanganensis Simon and Fage with Amphigyrum nebulosum Tullgren, are rejected. Themacrys stolida Simon is considered a nomen dubium.

T1  - Cladistics and classification of the Notodontidae (Lepidoptera, Noctuoidea) based on larval and adult morphology.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 204
SP  - 1
N2  - A phylogeny for the Notodontidae was constructed based on cladistic relationships among 52 notodontid species. The study included taxa from all previously recognized family group categories and all biogeographic regions. Twelve species, chosen from the rest of the Noctuoidea, served as an outgroup. The data set consisted of 174 morphological characters (100 from adults and 74 from final instar larvae) comprising 437 character states. Cladistic analyses using the Hennig86 parsimony program produced eight equally parsimonious trees, each with a length of 853 steps, a consistency index of 0.30, and a retention index of 0.66. All morphological characters are described and all character states are figured using line drawings, photographs, and scanning electron micrographs. Adult and larval habitus photographs for taxa used in the analysis are also included. The Notodontidae, as here defined, is a monophyletic group. Six adult and five larval synapomorphies support monophyly, but none occur universally. The genus Doa Neumoegen and Dyar (Doidae) is hypothesized to be the sister-group of the Notodontidae. Oenosandra Walker, an Australian genus formerly referred to the notodontid subfamily Thaumetopoeinae, is instead placed as the sister group of Doidae + Notodontidae. The Oenosandridae, new family, is proposed. In a reclassification of the Notodontidae, nine monophyletic subfamilies are recognized: the Thaumetopoeinae, Pygaerinae, Platychasmatinae, Notodontinae, Phalerinae, Dudusinae, Heterocampinae, Nystaleinae, and Dioptinae. The Hemiceratini of previous authors is of uncertain status, and placement of the genus Lirimiris requires further research. The new tribe Scranciini is placed in the Dudusinae. A key to notodontid subfamilies is presented, and apomorphic character states, as well as diagnoses, are listed for each group. General topics related to phylogeny of the Notodontidae are discussed. First, the question of whether taxon addition will affect the proposed classification is addressed. Platychasma virgo Butler, previously placed in its own notodontid subfamily, the Platychasmatinae, is used as a test case. When added to the analysis this species arises as a basal lineage in the Notodontidae. Topology in the rest of the cladogram is unaffected. The subfamily Platychasmatinae is retained. The proposed hypothesis of relationships among subfamilies is roughly similar to previous concepts of notodontid phylogeny. For example, the current scheme supports placement of the Thaumetopoeinae and Pygaerinae as basal groups and placement of the Dioptinae and Nystaleinae as derived sister groups. However, in most other respects this new phylogeny differs from previous hypotheses. Larval and adult data were also analyzed separately. Consensus trees for larvae and for adults show poor resolution compared to the tree based on all data. Monophyly of some subfamilies (e.g. the Dudusinae) is supported exclusively by adult synapomorphies, and of others (e.g., the Heterocampinae) by larval characters. These results suggest that constructing a stable classification for the Notodontidae requires data from both life  stages. As a group, the Notodontidae do not show obvious larval host association patterns. Nevertheless, cladistic analyses suggest that almost all Salicaceae-feeders belong in a monophyletic group and that, for the most part, Fagaceae specialists are restricted to the Heterocampinae. The Dioptinae, unique among Notodontidae in being diurnal and in typically feeding on toxic plants, appear to have evolved from a nocturnal ancestor that utilized nontoxic hosts.

VL  - 207

N2  - The species of Gyrinus Müller from North America (North of Mexico) are revised; 40 species are assigned to Gyrinus. Gyrinus rugosus is described as new from California. Separate keys are provided for males and females. Information is provided about type specimens and taxonomic notes, sexual dimorphism, habitat information, and Nearctic distribution. Five new synonyms are recognized: G. frosti Fall and G. floridensis Ochs are junior synonyms of G. gibber LeConte, G. hatchi Wallis is junior synonym of G. ventralis Kirby, G. punctellus Ochs is junior synonym of G. bifarius Fall, and G. instabilis Fall is junior synonym of G. aeratus Stephens. Lectotypes are designated for: G. pectoralis LeConte, G. minutus Fabricius, G. rockinghamensis LeConte, G. confinis LeConte, G. dichrous LeConte, G. maculiventris LeConte, G. aquiris LeConte, and G. ventralis Kirby. A neotype is designated for each of G. parcus Say, G. analis Say, G. obtusus Say. G. limbatus Say is listed as a nomen inquirendum. The occurrence of G. marinus Gyllenhal and G. aeratus Stephens in the Nearctic region is verified. In the eastern half of North America, the most speciose region is in the northeast United States; in western North America it is in British Columbia. The phylogenetic position of Gyrinus in Gyrinidae is investigated by using characters in Hatch (1925), Ochs (1926-27), Balfour-Browne (1950), Brinck (1955), and Larsén (1966), with Spanglerogyrus Folkerts (Spanglerogyinae) as the outgroup. Most data indicate that, within Gyrininae, Orectochilini is the sister clade to Gyrinini and Enhydrini. A phylogenetic hypothesis for Nearctic species of Gyrinus is also constructed; this phylogenetic analysis is highly polychotomous but four groups are suggested. Monophyly of these groups is primarily established by abdominal coloration and aedeagal structure. Two subgroups based on leg and tarsal claw coloration are proposed within the third and fourth clades.

T1  - Mammalian diversity in Neotropical lowland rainforests : a preliminary assessment.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 230
SP  - 1
N2  - Information about the magnitude and geographic distribution of mammalian diversity in Neotropical lowland rainforests is important for evaluating research and conservation priorities in Central and South America. Although relevant inventory data are rapidly accumulating in the literature, real site-to-site diversity differences are hard to identify because many confounding factors can affect the size and composition of faunal lists. Herein we assess the available information about Neotropical rainforest mammal diversity and suggest guidelines for future work by reviewing inventory methods, documenting and discussing faunal lists from ten localities, and summarizing geographic range data to predict diversity patterns that can be tested by field and museum research. All inventory methods are biased because each is suitable for collecting or observing only a fraction of the morphologically and behaviorally diverse mammalian fauna that inhabits Neotropical rainforests. Hence, many methods must be used in combination to census whole communities. Although no combination of methods can be guaranteed to produce complete inventories, the omission or nonintensive application of any of several essential methods probably guarantees incomplete results. We recommend nine methods that, used intensively and in combination, should maximize the efficiency of future inventory fieldwork. Ten rainforest mammal inventories selected as exemplars illustrate several common problems: sampling effort is highly variable from study to study, species accumulation curves are not asymptotic for any fauna, essential field methods were omitted in every case, and some localities were partially defaunated by hunters prior to inventory. Meaningful diversity comparisons are therefore impossible without a major investment in additional fieldwork at each site. Geographic range data provide an essential alternative source of diversity estimates. Comparisons of inventory results with geographic expectations (diversity predictions based on range data) suggest that all existing inventories are incomplete, that the degree of incompleteness is inversely correlated with inventory duration, and that special methods are required to add elusive species to faunal lists. The range data at hand also suggest several geographic patterns that should be tested with carefully focussed fieldwork. (1) Mammalian diversity in Amazonia is probably greatest in the western subregion (between the Rio Negro and the Rio Madeira, where over 200 species might be sympatric at some localities), least in the Guiana subregion (east of the Negro and north of the Amazon), and intermediate in southeastern Amazonia (east of the Madeira and south of the Amazon). (2) Geographic variation in Amazonian diversity chiefly involves marsupials, bats, primates, and rodents; by contrast, xenarthran, carnivore, and ungulate faunas are remarkably uniform across the entire region. (3) In Central American rainforests, a conspicuous and apparently monotonic diversity gradient extends from eastern Panama (where mammalian diversity is within the range of Amazonian values) to southern Mexico (where mammalian diversity may be less than anywhere else on the rainforested Neotropical mainland). Mammalian diversity in coastal Venezuelan and southeastern Brazilian rainforests is difficult to assess with existing literature and collection resources, but neither region is likely to be as diverse as Amazonia. Despite a few dissenting voices, the literature of New World mammalogy provides compelling evidence that mammalian diversity, as measured by sympatric species richness, is greatest in lowland tropical rainforests and decreases along gradients of increasing latitude, elevation, and aridity. Thus, the mammalian faunas of western Amazonia are the most diverse of any in the Americas and perhaps in the world. We briefly discuss the generality and causes of observed diversity patterns in terms of contemporary ecology and historical scenarios. Significant advances in understanding mammalian diversity patterns in Neotropical rainforests will require systematic revisions of many problematic genera and an aggressive program to inventory poorly sampled areas while opportunities to do so yet remain.

N2  - Plesiorycteropus, an extinct mammal known only from the Quaternary of Madagascar, is conventionally regarded as a tubulidentate and therefore as closely related to extant Orycteropus. However, the shared derived traits that might support such an association have never been adequately identified or critically evaluated. The character analyses presented in this paper reveal that many of the identifiably derived traits of the skeleton of Plesiorycteropus are related to adaptations for digging. Aardvarks possess many of the same adaptations, but so do fossorial members of a broad diversity of other eutherian groups, including Dasypodidae, Manidae, Myrmecophagidae, Lipotyphla, and many others. Identifiably derived traits of Plesiorycteropus that have no obvious connection with digging are few, but the ones that can be adequately documented are by no means unique to aardvarks. Indeed, several of the apparently derived cranial and postcranial traits of Plesiorycteropus specifically echo conditions encountered in primitive ungulates, including various members of the paraphyletic assemblage Condylarthra. Accordingly, the view that Plesiorycteropus is unambiguously aardvarklike in its morphology and adaptations is not supported in this study. To examine how a parsimony analysis of a stated character set might specify a placement for Plesiorycteropus, a 30-character, 16-taxon data matrix was formatted for the program Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony. Two additional characters, based on morphological assessments of key characters made by Bryan Patterson, were also used in some runs. Although the scale of morphological variation in Plesiorycteropus requires the recognition of two species, P. madagascariensis and P. germainepetterae n. sp., for the characters under consideration interspecific polymorphism was usually found to be negligible. Although in most manipulations of the data matrix Plesiorycteropus tended to group with ungulates sensu lato (including Tubulidentata), its placement was unstable, and an exclusive sister-group pairing of Plesiorycteropus + Tubulidentata was rarely encountered. On the other hand, close pairings with xenarthrans, manids, and lipotyphlans did not occur unless the data matrix was purposely biased in those directions. As a minimum hypothesis, it may be concluded that Plesiorycteropus is apparently part of the great ungulate 'bush,' but a more exact placement is not convincingly provided by any of the cladistic solutions investigated. One resolution of this problem would be to refer Plesiorycteropus to superorder Ungulata as incertae sedis, but this would make it the only Recent mammal lacking a recognized ordinal affiliation. An alternative would be to consider Plesiorycteropus to be the sole known member of its own order. This is the resolution preferred here, on the ground that Plesiorycteropus is as morphologically distinctive as any eutherian group currently granted ordinal status. The new order Bibymalagasia is created for its reception.

N2  - A cladistic analysis is conducted, encompassing a series of hierarchical levels within the Sabellidae-Caobangiidae-Sabellongidae complex. Generic relationships within this complex are examined using 36 genera and 43 characters. Outgroup comparisons with the Serpulidae s.s. and Spirorbidae are initially suggested. It is argued, however, that maintaining the Spirorbidae results in the Serpulidae being paraphyletic. Therefore, the Serpulidae s.l. (including spirorbids) are used as the outgroup. The possibility of using the Terebellomorpha (= Terebellida) as an outgroup is discussed. The more inclusive relationship between the orders Sabellida and Spionida is examined, leading to the conclusion that the Spionida is paraphyletic by way of recognizing the Sabellida. Sixteen most parsimonious cladograms are found, differing only slightly in the placement of some genera. Caobangia Giard and Sabellonga Hartman, representing the monotypic Caobangiidae and Sabellongidae, respectively, fall within the Sabellidae. In order to define the Sabellidae as monophyletic, Caobangia and Sabellonga must be placed in this family. Present sabellid subfamilies are either paraphyletic or polyphyletic, except for the monotypic Myxicolinae. Revised monophyletic subfamilies are suggested, comprising a more restricted Fabriciinae and expanded Sabellinae. Caobangia is placed into the former subfamily, while Sabellonga is moved to the latter. The Myxicolinae is not recognized, with Myxicola Koch in Renier being placed in the Sabellinae. Genera of the revised Sabellidae are reviewed in light of the characters used in the cladistic analysis. Several genera are poorly defined in terms of monophyly (e.g., Oriopsis Caullery and Mesnil, Jasmineira Langerhans), while six genera are not defined by synapomorphies: Chone Kröyer, Sabellastarte Kröyer, Perkinsiana Knight-Jones, Pseudopotamilla Bush, Eudistylia Bush, and Schizobranchia Bush. Setal transformation series are discussed, suggesting the presence of regulatory mechanisms localized within a particular body region or operating throughout the thorax and abdomen. Such mechanisms appear to allow for considerable structural lability, resulting in convergence of thoracic and abdominal setal forms from different plesiomorphic states. In some cases, it also appears as though abdominal setal forms may be controlled by segment age and location along the body. Changes in thoracic or abdominal setal forms in notopodia and neuropodia within a particular segment appear to be independent of one  another.

T1  - The mammals of Paracou, French Guiana, a Neotropical lowland rainforest fauna. Part 1, Bats.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 237
SP  - 1
N2  - This report describes the results of bat inventory fieldwork at Paracou, a lowland rainforest locality in northern French Guiana. Working within a 3-km radius over the course of 168 sampling days from 1991 to 1994, we captured 3126 bats, of which about 78% were taken in ground-level mistnets, 10% in mistnets suspended above ground level, and 12% at roosts. We identified a total of 78 species, including 10 emballonurids, 2 noctilionids, 1 mormoopid, 49 phyllostomids, 1 furipterid, 1 thyropterid, 5 vespertilionids, and 9 molossids. Among our taxonomic results, we describe a new species of Micronycteris (sensu stricto) to honor André Brosset, pioneering monographer of rainforest bat faunas in India, Africa, and South America. In addition, we report the first records of eight other species from French Guiana: Centronycteris maximiliani, Peropteryx kappleri, Saccopteryx gymnura, Micronycteris homezi, Micronycteris schmidtorum, Molossops paranus, Molossus sinaloae, and Promops centralis. Most of these were previously known from Surinam, but the range extensions are significant for Saccopteryx gymnura (ca. 900 km), Micronycteris homezi (2200 km), and M. schmidtorum (1500 km). Altogether, the known bat fauna of French Guiana now consists of 102 species. The following significant taxonomic results are also reported herein. (1) Comparison of Paracou specimens referable to Peropteryx macrotis (Wagner) with the holotype of P. trinitatis Miller supports the conclusions of recent investigators that these taxa are separate species. (2) Morphological variation among specimens of small Choeroniscus from Paracou, together with examination of type material and a critical review of the literature, suggest that C. minor (Peters), C. intermedius (Allen and Chapman), and C. inca Thomas are conspecific; the oldest available name for the species is Peters'. (3) Glyphonycteris Thomas (including Barticonycteris Hill as a synonym), Micronycteris Gray (including Xenoctenes Miller as a synonym), and Trinycteris Sanborn are rediagnosed as distinct genera; Lampronycteris Sanborn and Neonycteris Sanborn, two other erstwhile subgenera of Micronycteris (sensu lato), should also be treated as full genera. (4) Micronycteris homezi Pirlot, based on a lost holotype and previously considered a nomen dubium, is redescribed and rediagnosed as a valid species. (5) Micronycteris megalotis (Gray) and M. microtis Miller are distinct species represented by sympatric collections from Paracou and other material similarly interpreted by recent investigators. (6) Mimon bennettii (Gray) and M. cozumelae Goldman are diagnosable as distinct species by consistent external and craniodental character differences. (7) Ectophylla H. Allen is rediagnosed to include Mesophylla Thomas in recognition of the sister-group relationship between E. alba H. Allen and E. macconnelli (Thomas). (8) The recent hypothesis that Sturnira lilium (E. Geoffroy) and S. luisi Davis are conspecific is rejected as implausible because of trenchant cranial character differences. (9) The Venezuelan and French Guianan specimens recently identified in the literature as Eptesicus andinus J.A. Allen are not conspecific with the holotype of that species; instead, examination of type specimens, other comparative material, and the primary literature suggests that this material is referable to E. chiriquinus Thomas. (10) All currently accepted synonymies for taxa included within Davis's (1966) andinus group of Eptesicus are apparently incorrect; in our view, E. andinus is a senior synonym of E. montosus Thomas and E. chiralensis Anthony, whereas E. chiriquinus is a senior synonym of E. inca Thomas. (11) We review the contents of Cynomops Thomas, currently ranked as a subgenus of Molossops Peters, and tabulate diagnostic characters for the four species we regard as valid: M. abrasus (Temminck), M. greenhalli (Goodwin), M. paranus (Thomas), and M. planirostris (Peters). (12) Molossus barnesi Thomas is a valid species readily distinguishable from both M. molossus (Pallas) and M. coibensis J.A. Allen. Analyses of our sampling results indicate that (1) distinct sets of species are effectively sampled by different capture methods; (2) distinct sets of species inhabit different local habitats; and (3) increased sampling effort with any method generally results in more species, although the rate of accumulation declines with sample size (number of captures). Based on nonparametric statistical extrapolations, we estimate that the Paracou bat fauna probably consists of somewhere between 85 and 95 species; the more conservative richness estimator suggests that our inventory is perhaps about 90% complete. Judging from the known or inferred behaviors of the rare taxa (singletons and doubletons) in our data, most of the local species missing from this inventory are probably aerial insectivores, gleaning insectivores, or nectarivores. In terms of higher taxonomic composition, the bat fauna at Paracou is typical of those found throughout the humid Neotropical lowlands. A quantitative analysis of faunal similarity at the species level among 14 rainforest localities chosen as exemplars clusters the Paracou list with others previously reported from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, next with lists from elsewhere in Amazonia, and lastly with Central American lists. Not surprisingly, pairwise similarity values show a positive correlation between faunal resemblance and geographic proximity within the Neotropical rainforest biome. Many (47%) of the bat species in the Paracou fauna are essentially pan-Neotropical in distribution and most of these are also known from habitats other than rainforest. The remaining species exhibit more restricted geographic distribution patterns, but true Amazonian endemics constitute only a minor fraction of the Paracou bat fauna. Species richness comparisons among inventory sites are complicated by problems of inconsistent methodology, habitat representation, and sampling effort. For example, the apparently exceptional diversity of emballonurids, phyllostomines, and molossids in the Paracou fauna is plausibly explained by our intensive use of elevated netting and roost surveys, and by prolonged effort, all of which factors act to reduce the well-known capture bias of ground-level mistnets (which consistently undersample these taxa in the short term). However, the low richness of carolliines and stenodermatines at Paracou by comparison with most other Amazonian (especially western Amazonian) localities is apparently real. The only approximately valid statistical comparison of species richness that we can make between sites based on published capture-frequency data suggests an increase of approximately 50% in understory bats from eastern Central America to Amazonia, but the real or artifactual nature of this estimated difference remains to be evaluated. A trophic classification of Paracou bats indicates that aerial insectivores are the most speciose feeding guild in the local fauna, followed by gleaning animalivores, frugivores, and nectarivores; omnivores, sanguivores, and piscivores are minor components. Patterns of differential habitat use among species within some feeding guilds can be inferred from our capture-frequency data, notably for aerial insectivores and frugivores. By contrast, gleaning animalivores appear to be largely restricted to primary forest, a puzzling phenomenon previously reported from other Neotropical rainforest localities. To facilitate future inventory fieldwork we provide (1) detailed descriptions of survey and capture methods, (2) illustrations of most local habitats recognized as distinct, (3) complete breakdowns of capture frequencies by method and habitat for each species, (4) photographs of numerous roosts at which bats were captured, and (5) descriptions and/or illustrations of useful characters for identifying species hitherto frequently confused in the field. Finally, we make recommendations for improving bat inventory efficiency, suggest minimal standards for reporting inventory data, urge the adoption of quantitative methods for intersite diversity comparisons, and comment on the prospects for rapid diversity assessment of rainforest bat faunas.

T1  - A generic revision of the spider family Zodariidae (Araneae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 201
SP  - 1
N2  - The family Zodariidae is revised at the generic level. All available type specimens of species were examined. The family history is reviewed, morphology is described, and polarity of the character variations is established. The phylogeny for the genera is derived from a cladistic analysis using HENNIG86. A list of all generic names used in Zodariidae and a key to the genera are provided. Zodariidae is diagnosed by the absence of a serrula, the presence of lateral teeth on the tarsal claws, long anterior spinnerets, and the burrowing habit. Six subfamilies are recognized: Cyriocteinae, new subfamily, Lachesaninae, new subfamily, Cydrelinae Simon, Storenomorphinae Simon, Storeninae Simon and Zodariinae Simon. The family contains 47 genera, 13 of which are new: Antillorena (type Storena pollii Simon), Aschema (type A. pallida, new species), Asteron (type A. reticulatum, new species), Forsterella (type Forsterella faceta, new species), Madrela (type M. madrela, new species), Nostera (type N. lynx, new species), Platnickia (type Drassus elegans Nicolet), Psammoduon (type Caesetius deserticola Simon), Psammorygma (type P. caligata, new species), Ranops (type R. caprivi, new species), Storamia (type Storena meadii O.P.-Cambridge), Storosa (type S. obscura, new species), and Suffasia (type Suffucia tigrina Simon). Thirteen new generic synonymies are established: Suffucia Simon and Doosia Kishida with Asceua Thorell; Hyltoniella Mello-Leitão and Valcheta Mello-Leitão with Cybaeodamus Mello-Leitão; Langbiana Hogg with Mallinella Strand; Tijucaia Mello-Leitão and Naibena Chamberlin with Tenedos O.P.-Cambridge; Patiscana Strand with Cicynethus Simon; Cydrelichus Pocock and Tryssoclitus Simon with Caesetius Simon; Systenoplacis Simon with Capheris Simon; Zodariellum Andreeva and Tyschenko with Acanthinozodium Denis; Hermippella Lessert with Palfuria Simon. The following genera were removed from the Zodariidae and transferred to the family in brackets: Arushina Caporiacco (Clubionidae), Hoplolathys Caporiacco (Dictynidae), Mevianops Mello-Leitão (Agelenidae), Tymbira Mello-Leitão (Amaurobiidae),  and Zodariops Mello-Leitão (Gnaphosidae). The status of Cryptothele L. Koch is uncertain. Nanahua Badcock and Tristichops Taczanowski remain incertae sedis.

T1  - Sthenurus (Macropodidae, Marsupialia) from the Pleistocene of Lake Callabonna, South Australia.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 225
SP  - 1
N2  - This study of the skeletal remains of three species of the extinct kangaroo Sthenurus (Sthenurinae: Macropodidae) from Lake Callabonna, northern South Australia, details the comparative osteology of these taxa and their functional, anatomical, and phylogenetic implications. Geological study of the locality assigns these fossils to the base of the Quaternary sequence in laminated clay and fine sands that are part of a unit correlated with the Millyera Formation of the Lake Frome area immediately south of Lake Callabonna. These deposits accumulated in a lake of variable salinity, several times the size of the present Callabonna playa. The plant remains associated with the Callabonna Fauna suggest a more arborescent flora than that near the present-day salina but one containing taxa that still exist in the surrounding region. These facts indicate a seasonal climate with fluctuating water table but a regionally more effective rainfall than at present. Direct C14 dating of wood from the Sthenurus-bearing deposits establishes an age beyond the limit of the radiocarbon method and regional geological correlations suggest a medial Pleistocene age within the span 0.2-0.7 Ma as most likely for the sthenurine kangaroos and associated large marsupials and ratite birds that constitute the Callabonna Fauna. Like the other large-bodied vertebrates at Lake Callabonna, the Sthenurus species were mired in the clays while attempting to cross the floor of the lake during low-water or dry times. This mode of accumulation has yielded an unprecedented opportunity for comparative study of the remains of individual animals. Three closely allied sthenurine species coexisted at Lake Callabonna: a new giant taxon, Sthenurus stirlingi, a somewhat smaller S. tindalei, and the considerably smaller S. andersoni. Strong sexual dimorphism is shown by the larger taxa, resulting in size overlap between individuals, but morphological criteria identify the sexes and taxa involved. Comparative osteology of these Sthenurus species with Macropus giganteus emphasizes how different they are from the living gray kangaroo, especially in their short, deep skulls, long front feet with very reduced lateral digits, and the virtually monodactyl hind feet. These distinctions, and many others, limit functional analysis for lack of a closely comparable living model. We have nevertheless tried to gather the evidence into a coherent picture of Sthenurus as a living animal. The cheek teeth of these Sthenurus species fit the browsing grade of Sanson's (1978) model. The slender forelimbs are better fitted for feeding than locomotor function. These limbs could be raised above the head, and the hands, with their long phalanges and claws, could have grasped high vegetation. The vertebral column is more rigid than in living kangaroos and flexion is limited, but considerable extension of the anterior pan of the body could have been retained as an important function in reaching for high browse. The pelvis is modified for flexion and adduction of the thigh, which would support a bulky animal while standing or elevating the body. The hind limb is more massive than in Macropus, but the elements are of similar proportion and there appears to be greater emphasis on the elastic properties of the tendons and ligaments to augment muscular action across joints, especially the knee and plantar parts of the pes. We conclude that species of Sthenurus, like other sthenurines, were bulky, browsing kangaroos that sacrificed quadrupedal or pentapedal movement for greater dependence on bipedal saltation and extension of the body and forelimbs for higher browsing. This diverse subfamily was a prominent element in Pleistocene faunas in Australia. Several taxa of comparable size were often found together which suggests partitioning of the browsing feeding mode--a broad niche that seems to contain few adherents among living large kangaroos"--P.3.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 231
SP  - 1
N2  - Studies of published records and of about 36,900 specimens of native mammals from Bolivia reveal that at least 327 species occur there. Probably more than 20 other species, either new to science or new to Bolivia, remain to be discovered. In addition to these species names, some 44 additional subspecies names are used. Most of the subspecies names reflect taxonomic history more than detailed knowledge of geographic variation. In this report, the taxonomic status of each taxon within Bolivia is noted. Scientific names that have been used for Bolivian specimens are given for each species and subspecies, and all known publications that have specifically referred to Bolivian specimens are cited, along with a few other works selected for special reasons. Specimens are listed, and localities are mapped, including the prediction of the probable distribution of each species within Bolivia. Illustrated keys are based primarily on external, cranial, and dental characters and include 10 domestic and introduced species in addition to native species. The number of species present in most local areas ranges from about 50 to 180. Analysis indicates four major faunal areas: lowland tropics, lowland temperate zone (including the chacoan area), forested yungas, and highlands (altiplano). The highland and lowland faunas are almost mutually exclusive; the break between temperate and tropical is indistinct.

JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 241
SP  - 1
N2  - Species of the New World genus Cladochaeta are revised, and the natural history of several of them is presented. From 14 described species in the genus, there now are 119 total, based on 105 new species, primarily Neotropical. The distributions of the three described species of North American Cladochaeta (floridana, inversa, and sturtevanti) are detailed for the first time. Four new North American species are described: C. wilhansoni, from Utah; C. dracula and C. heedi, both from Arizona; and C. florinversa, from southern Florida. The newly described Neotropical species are the following: barista,abbrevifusca, abeja, abrupta, adusta, akantha, albifrons, ambidextra,amblyharpa, antalba, aquila, arthrostyla, austrinversa, bispina, brunnea, calvovis, carinata, centetor, chaeta, chelifera, crassa, dejecta, devriesi, dextra, dikra, diminuta, dolichofrons, dominicana, dominitica, ectopia, erecta, fasciata, fuscora, genuinus, glans, glapica, hadrunca, hamula, hermani, hodita, howdeni, incessa, inornata, jamaicensis, janzeni, labidia, laevacerca, longistyla, masneri, mathisi, mexinversa, mystaca, neblina, neoinversa, neosimplex, obscura, obunca, onyx, ostia, paravolsella, paulhansoni, polia, proctobarba, propenicula, pruinopleura, pseudikra, pseudunca, psychotria, ranhyae, reversa, robusta, santana, sclerstyla, sepia, sicula, similex, simplex, spinacosta, spinula, spira, starki, sternospina, telescopica, tepui, tica, trauma, tricerabops, tripunctata, tubula, unca, vapida, venebula, verdifrons, vermes, vittata, vivipara, volsella, vomica, wirthi, yanomama, and zurquia. Grimaldi and Nguyen are the authors of all newly described species. Cladochaeta taeniatipennis (Duda) and C. peruviana (Duda) are transferred to Cladochaeta from the genus Diathoneura, the former species being the type species of Diathoneura. Illustrations and discussions of the adult diagnostic features of each species are provided, as are distributions. Female terminalia are plesiomorphic to most Drosophilinae by lacking pegs on the oviscapt, and variation in the terminal sternites and tergites of females was found to be as species-specific as male genitalia. Females have nonsclerotized sperm receptacles (apparently the ventral receptacles), but no diagnostic variation was found in these structures. Male genitalia provided most characters for classification of species in the genus, which is basically a system of species groups as presented here.  Larvae of C. inversa and C. floridana are de-scribed and illustrated. They are highly modified for acalyptrate Diptera by possessing 6 pairs of prolegs, each with a rosette of creeping welt spinules; the cephalopharyngeal skeleton is unsclerotized, except for the minute, very sharp mandibular hooks; and the posterior pair of spiracles is very long and telescoping, adapting the larva to being submerged in spittle. Five Neotropical spe-cies are recorded as being viviparous. Host records are summarized, and various new ones presented. Hosts are almost always spittle- bug nymphs (Auchenorrhyncha: Cercopidae). A larva of Cladochaeta attaches itself to the dorsum of its host's abdomen, where it makes minute holes presumably for feeding on hemolymph. An ephydrid is reported as living in the spittle masses of the cercopid, Tomaspis inca, in Costa Rica; it is saprophagous, not parasitic; this is a habit previously unknown for that family. Several records of adventitious spittle-bug associations in the Drosophilidae are also reported. In lieu of experimental data, all evidence indicates that the larvae of Cladochaeta are parasitic. The great increase in species diversity makes this group the most speciose genus of Drosophilidae endemic to the Western Hemisphere.

N2  - Descriptions are given of numerous new linyphiid genera and species from South America; these are listed alphabetically in the index. Of the known South American linyphiid genera, Dubiaranea (formerly Hormembolus) now has the greatest number of species, and considerable increases have also been made to the genera Laminacauda, Neomaso, Meioneta, and Sphecozone. In addition to a variety of small erigonine-like species, characterized by a simple tracheal system, a number of true erigonine species (with the complex tracheal system) are now found in South America. These erigonines fall into two groups which appear to be related to the Erigone and Ceratinopsis groups of genera. Most are endemic to South America, and none of the common, widespread linyphiid genera of the Northern Hemisphere seem to be present, except probably as recent arrivals. No representatives of the subfamily Mynogleninae have been discovered, and it is concluded that this subfamily is not present in South America. There is no obvious congruence between the linyphiid fauna of South America and that of New Zealand.

T1  - Pectinoid bivalves of the Permian-Triassic crisis.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 227
SP  - 1
N2  - This contribution concludes a general revision of genera of pectiniform bivalves (pectinoids) of the world's marine rocks near the Permo-Triassic boundary. The study includes the morphology, taxonomy, and distribution of some 20 families and 30 genera, several of them new (for new taxa see Contents). It is based on the best material available anywhere, mainly from the western United States. The known diversity of these early pectinoids declined gradually from about 23 genera in the Guadalupian (M. Permian) to a minimum of 5 in the Griesbachian (L. Triassic). After the biological decline, they did not recover substantial diversity until late Triassic (Norian) time. So they shared the great mass extinction with most other groups of marine invertebrates. The crisis extended over some tens of millions of years and was slow, rather than catastrophic. This diversity pattern agrees well with carbon isotope ratios that seem to reflect a depressed oceanic productivity in early Triassic time.

T1  - A phylogenetic, revised classification of genera in the Drosophilidae (Diptera).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 197
SP  - 1
N2  - A phylogenetic system and classification of most genera and subgenera of the Drosophilidae are proposed that incorporate tribes, subtribes, infratribes, and genus groups. The new classification is based on a cladistic analysis using the computer parsimony program HENNIG86 and 217 adult morphological characters for a representative set of 120 species. A more complete matrix is provided, with 160 species in most genera and subgenera of the family. The history of drosophilid classification is reviewed, and the relevance of morphological (vs. molecular) data in phylogenetic reconstruction is briefly discussed. Position of the family in the superfamily Ephydroidea is examined and based on previously published data and new characters. The family Drosophilidae is the sister group to the Curtonotidae; this pair is the sister group to the rest of the Ephydroidea (Diastatidae, Campichoetidae, Camillidae, and Ephydridae). The Drosophilidae are monophyletic and diagnosed as possessing two basal costal wing vein breaks, a lateral seam in the pedicel, three pairs of frontal orbital setae (1 being proclinate, others reclinate), abdominal spiracle pairs VI + VII lying at base of tergite VI in males, sternite VI and tergite VII lost in males, small basal-medial wing cell lost (rederived in some taxa), and minute spines on the mesal surface of the fore femur lost. Each of the 217 characters is described and most are illustrated in detail; many are newly discovered, including features from the proboscis to the male and female terminalia. The traditional subfamily classification of the Steganinae and Drosophilinae is preserved, based on new, apomorphic evidence. An alternative classification to that of Okada (1989) is proposed, with 4 tribes, 6 subtribes, 2 infratribes, and 13 genus complexes/groups (informal categories), and all but 5 genera and subgenera are classified within these taxa. In addition, the Drosophila subgenera Hirtodrosophila, Lordiphosa, and Scaptodrosophila are each removed from that genus and elevated to generic rank. The Hawaiian drosophilids formerly placed in the subgenus Drosophila were found not to belong to this genus. Genus Idiomyia, new status, is used to include this large, obviously monophyletic group of Hawaiian endemic species, as well as the genera Ateledrosophila and Nudidrosophila. The closest relative of Idiomyia  sensu lato appears to be the Zygothrica genus group (including Hirtodrosophila, Mycodrosophila, Paramycodrosophila, Paraliodrosophila, and Zygothrica). Scaptomyza, including the Hawaiian species in this genus, is monophyletic; Drosophila (Engiscaptomyza) is most closely related to Scaptomyza. The cladogram based on morphological data is compared to trees of Throckmorton, Okada, and several based on molecular data for a smaller set of drosophilid taxa. Inconsistencies between hypotheses are discussed. All higher-level generic group taxa and new genera are diagnosed.

T1  - Evolution of the trilobite subfamily Proetinae Salter, 1864, and the origin, diversification, evolutionary affinity, and extinction of the Middle Devonian proetid fauna of eastern North America.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 223
SP  - 1
N2  - This study considers the biogeographic origins, evolutionary affinities, and patterns of diversification and extinction in a portion of the Lower and Middle Devonian proetid trilobite fauna of eastern North America. Four generic clades comprising about 45 species are known from the strata of the upper Emsian (Sawkillian) Bois Blanc Limestone and Schoharie Grit, the Eifelian (Southwoodian) Onondaga Limestone, and the Givetian (Cazenovian, Tioughniogan, Taghanic) Hamilton Group. These taxa have traditionally been assigned to the subfamilies Proetinae Salter, 1864, and/or Dechenellinae Pribyl, 1946. These are Crassiproetus Stumm, 1953a, Basidechenella Richter, 1912, Dechenella Kayser, 1880, and Monodechenella Stumm, 1953a, which were originally considered to be closely related. A higher-level phylogenetic analysis of the Proetinae is conducted to see if these taxa were indeed closely related and thus represent a single endemic radiation of species in eastern North America or rather a series of independent lineages in that region. In the course of discerning characters that defined the Proetinae, it was discovered that Monodechenella lacks several of the characters that define the Proetinae, and the members of this genus therefore must be excluded from this subfamily. They instead appear to belong to a larger group informally referred to as the 'Thebanaspis clade,' which appears to be closely related to the Proetinae. A phylogenetic analysis is performed on proetine ingroup taxa using 21 taxa and 53 characters, and several of the major generic clades in the Proetinae are considered. The phylogenetic analysis of the Proetinae is used to ascertain the ancestral biogeographic states for the three genera in the Proetinae that form an important component of the Lower and Middle Devonian trilobite fauna of eastern North America. This information is used to determine if these taxa are ancestrally present in eastern North America or rather represent a series of invasions from other biogeographic regions. Other taxa occurring in eastern North America at this time appear to represent  elements that invaded from Armorica. This invasion of taxa has been related to the collision between plates that produced the Acadian Orogeny during the Middle Devonian. Patterns in these proetid taxa are compared with those known for other groups to ascertain what control the Acadian Orogeny as a biogeographic event may have had on the appearance of these taxa in eastern North America. Phylogenetic analysis is then performed on all available species in each of these generic clades that occur in eastern North America. Species that belong to these clades but which hail from other biogeographic regions are also considered. These phylogenies were used to assess macroevolutionary patterns such as diversification and extinction within each of these clades in eastern North America. In addition to being an important paleogeographic event, the Acadian Orogeny also caused major paleoenvironmental changes. The impact of these changes on the proetid fauna of eastern North America is assessed. It appears that a phenomenon analogous to Vrba's (1985, 1992) Turnover Pulse Hypothesis may have mediated elevated speciation rates in the proetid taxa over the period considered. However, eventually the profound changes in environment appear to have led to the extinction of much of the proetid trilobite fauna of eastern North America. Information on patterns of occurrence in different geographic regions is combined with information from the phylogenetic analyses of the individual generic clades to consider large-scale biogeographic patterns in the late Lower and Middle Devonian. A method for considering biogeographic patterns using cladistic information is developed. This method is based on Brooks Parsimony Analysis, but it allows multiple events of range expansion and subsequent vicariant splitting to occur within each generic clade. This biogeographic method was used to evaluate the relationships between the Arctic, Armorican, and eastern North American paleobiogeographic regions. The relationships between the different major sedimentary basins in eastern North America, the Appalachian, Illinois, and Michigan basins, are also considered. Finally, the origin of major evolutionary faunas in the fossil record is discussed. Included is a brief discussion of a depauperate proetid fauna of the Emsian and Eifelian whose members do not belong to the four generic clades considered in detail. In this work four new genera are recognized: Plesiowensus, Arcticormistonia, Aayemenaytcheia, and Milesdavis. In addition, 12 new species are described: Arcticormistonia edgecombei, Crassiproetus halliturgidus, C. neoturgidus, C. stummi, C. schohariensis, Basidechenella cartwrightae, B. timwhitei, Dechenella perscheii, D. carvalhoae, Pedinodechenella modelli, Milesdavis eldredgei, and Monodechenella legrandsmithi. Diagnoses and discussions for all of the taxa considered are presented.

T1  - Revision and cladistic analysis of the Holarctic genus Atractotomus Fieber (Heteroptera, Miridae, Phylinae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 198
SP  - 1
N2  - The Holarctic genus Atractotomus Fieber is revised. Lepidopsallus Knight and Microphylidea Knight are relegated to synonymy with Atractotomus. Thirty-seven species are recognized, including 17 new species from the Nearctic region. Microphylidea prosopidis Knight, Psallus kolenatii (Flor), Rhinacloa nigripennis Schuh and Schwartz, and six species of Lepidopsallus (arizonae Knight, atricolor Knight, miniatus Knight, ovatus Knight rubidus (Uhler), tuthilli Knight) are transferred to Atractotomus. Atractotomus amygdali Wagner, A. mali (Meyer-Dür), A. rhodani Fieber, and A. vireti Wagner are assigned the status of species incertae sedis. Atractotomus femoralis Fieber and A. spissicornis (Schrank) are declared nomina dubia. Atractotomus crataegi and the remaining eight species of Lepidopsallus (australis Blatchley, claricornis Knight, hesperus Knight, longirostris Knight, minusculus Knight, olseni Knight, pini Knight, rostratus Knight) are transferred to Phoenicocoris Reuter. The following species synonymies are proposed (senior synonym first): Atractotomus albidicoxis Reuter = Lepidopsallus monticola Knight; Atractotomus balli Knight = Atractotomus purshiae Froeschner and Lepidopsallus californicus Knight; Atractotomus magnicornis (Fallén) = Atractotomus magnicornis buenoi Knight; Atractotomus miniatus (Knight) = Lepidopsallus nyssae Johnston; Atractotomus ovatus (Knight) = Lepidopsallus nicholi Knight; Atractotomus parvulus Reuter = Atractotomus mirificus Woodroffe; Atractotomus persquamosus Seidenstücker = Atractotomus brunomassai Carapezza. Illustrations and/or photographs are provided for the antennae and male genitalic structures of all species of Atractotomus. Scanning electron micrographs are presented for the scalelike setae, metafemur, and pretarsus of representative species of Atractotomus and related genera. Separate keys are provided for the Nearctic and Palearctic members of the genus. A phylogenetic analysis of species is presented using Psallus ancorifer (Fieber) for outgroup comparison. Three species groups are recognized from the resulting species phylogeny. An analysis of host plant associations suggests that Atractotomus was primitively associated with conifers, but shifted to legume feeding early in the evolution of the genus. In the Nearctic region, this was followed by separate shifts to feeding on Quercus, Salix, and Rhamnaceae + Rosaceae. Species diversity and endemism are greatest in parts of east-central and south-central Mexico. Species with restricted distributions also occur in southeastern Arizona, the Rocky Mountains, and upland regions of the Pacific coast states and Baja California. The phylogenetic analysis of species indicates a strong relationship between taxa occurring in the American Southwest and endemic species in central Mexico.

T1  - The mammals of Paracou, French Guiana, a Neotropical lowland rainforest fauna. Part 2, Nonvolant species.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 263
SP  - 1
N2  - This report describes the results of nonvolant mammal inventory fieldwork at Paracou, a lowland rainforest locality in northern French Guiana, and concludes the faunal analysis introduced by our previous monograph on the bats of Paracou (Simmons and Voss, 1998). Working within a 3-km radius over the course of 202 sampling dates from 1991 to 1994, we recorded a total of 64 nonvolant species by conventional trapping, arboreal platform trapping, pitfall trapping, diurnal and nocturnal hunting, and interviews with local residents. Included in this total species count are 12 marsupials, 9 xenarthrans, 6 primates, 10 carnivores, 5 ungulates, and 22 rodents. Systematic research with nonvolant mammal specimens collected as voucher material resulted in the discovery of new taxa, documented range extensions of previously described species, and helped resolve many longstanding taxonomic problems: (1) Gracilinanus emiliae (Thomas), herein reported for the first time from French Guiana, is redescribed and its known geographic distribution documented; based on examination of type material and original descriptions, G. longicaudus Hershkovitz is considered a junior synonym of G. emiliae, but Marmosa agricolai Moojen is not. (2) A new genus is proposed for Gracilinanus kalinowskii Hershkovitz, a taxon previously known only from eastern Peru, in recognition of its trenchant morphological differences from all other known didelphimorph marsupials. (3) Marmosops parvidens (Tate) and M. pinheiroi (Pine), the latter originally described as a subspecies of the former, are distinct species that occur sympatrically at Paracou; based on examination of type material, other taxa hitherto synonymized with M. parvidens are also judged to be valid species, including M. juninensis (Tate) and M. bishopi (Pine). (4) Monodelphis brevicaudata (Erxleben), M. glirina (Wagner), and M. palliolata (Osgood) are all distinct species diagnosable by unique combinations of morphological traits; based on examined specimens, M. brevicaudata (with type locality emended herein as Kartabo, Guyana) appears to be endemic to the Guiana subregion of Amazonia and to include both bicolored and tricolored phenotypes; a neotype from Cayenne, French Guiana, is designated to fix the application of Viverra touan Shaw as the oldest available name for the tricolored form. (5) Saguinus midas (Linnaeus) and S. niger (E. Geoffroy), currently treated as synonyms or conspecific races, are unambiguously diagnosable species that do not appear to be sister taxa; a neotype is designated to conserve current usage of niger E. Geoffroy for the black-handed tamarin of southeastern Amazonia. (6) Two new small species of Neacomys are described from material collected at Paracou; their diagnostic attributes are documented by detailed comparisons with other like-sized congeners from northern South America. (7) Nectomys melanius Thomas is recognized as a species distinct from N. squamipes (Brants) and N. palmipes J.A. Allen and Chapman; however, N. parvipes Petter is not a valid taxon and is herein synonymized with N. melanius. (8) The diagnostic characters of Neusticomys oyapocki (Petter and Dubost), a species previously known only from the holotype, are reevaluated and illustrated from freshly collected material. (9) Oecomys auyantepui Tate and O. paricola (Thomas), previously treated as synonyms, are valid species distinguished by consistent cranial differences and occupy allopatric ranges north and south of the Amazon, respectively. (10) A critical examination of small Oecomys specimens from Paracou and other Guianan localities supports the conclusions of other investigators that O. rutilus Anthony and O. bicolor (Tomes) are unambiguously diagnosable species. (11) Oligoryzomys fulvescens (Saussure) and O. microtis (J.A. Allen), currently regarded as valid allopatric species occurring north and south of the Amazon, respectively, are difficult to diagnose unambiguously and may be conspecific; new information is provided about the hitherto ambiguous type locality of the latter taxon. (12) Rhipidomys nitela Thomas is reported from French Guiana for the first time and its previously unpublished diagnostic differences from other congeners are tabulated and discussed. (13) A lectotype is designated for Coendou melanurus (Wagner), and the species is redescribed based on all known specimens in North American and European museums; diagnostic differences between this species and C. insidiosus (Olfers) are illustrated for the first time. (14) A red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta) is designated as the neotype of Mus aguti Linnaeus to preserve current usage of Dasyprocta prymnolopha (Wagler) for the black-rumped agouti. (15) The diagnostic differences between red and green acouchies (Myoprocta) are discussed and a neotype is designated for Cavia acouchy Erxleben to fix the application of that name to the red species; other nominal taxa of Myoprocta are identified as red or green acouchies based on examination of type material and original descriptions. (16) The diagnostic morphological traits of Proechimys cuvieri Petter and P. guyannensis (E. Geoffroy) are reevaluated and discussed based on character variation in topotypical (French Guianan) material. Analyses of our sampling results indicate that distinct sets of nonvolant species are effectively sampled by different inventory methods, and that increased sampling effort with any method generally results in more species. Although the rate of discovery of new species always decreases with increasing sample size, none of our graphs of species accumulation indicate that an asymptotic value was reached with any method. Instead, nonparametric statistical extrapolations suggest that the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna consists of somewhere between 69 and 74 species; by implication, our nonvolant inventory is about 86-93% complete. Most missing species are probably marsupials and rodents, but one or two expected primate species might have been locally extirpated by hunters prior to our fieldwork. In terms of higher taxonomic composition, the Paracou nonvolant mammal fauna is typical of those found throughout the humid Neotropical lowlands. However, a quantitative analysis of nonvolant faunal similarity at the species level among 12 exemplar rainforest inventories first clusters the Paracou list with others from the Guiana subregion of Amazonia, next with lists from elsewhere in Amazonia, and lastly with Central American lists. Pairwise similarity values likewise show an obvious positive correlation between faunal resemblance and geographic proximity within the Neotropical rainforest biome. At least 24 species (38%) of the Paracou nonvolant fauna are Amazonian endemics, but 18 (28%) are essentially pan-Neotropical in distribution; the remaining 22 species exhibit a variety of distributional patterns that suggest past connections among different sets of currently disjunct rainforested regions. Species richness comparisons among nonvolant faunal inventories are complicated by a variety of familiar problems including inconsistent methodology, presence or absence of certain key habitats, and uneven sampling effort. A conservative interpretation of sampling results from La Selva (Costa Rica), Paracou, and Manu (Peru), however, suggests progressive increases in richness of about 23% from Central America to the Guianas, and of about the same amount from the Guianas to western Amazonia; over the entire gradient (Central America to western Amazonia), the net increase in observed richness is at least 50%. Whereas rodents are consistently the most diverse clade in all well-sampled nonvolant faunas, rankings of other orders by relative richness exhibit considerable site-to-site variation, at least some of which appears to reflect real geographic differences in taxonomic diversity rather than sampling artifacts. Nonvolant rainforest mammals are hard to classify into trophic guilds due to behavioral plasticity and incomplete knowledge of relevant natural history. Preliminary guild comparisons among three exemplar faunas, however, suggest that the Paracou nonvolant community is substantially less diverse in arboreal frugivores and more diverse in terrestrial animalivores than are nonvolant communities at some Central American and western Amazonian sites. Subsistence and recreational hunting has clearly affected local populations of some nonvolant mammals at Paracou; whereas popular game species (e.g., large primates) were seldom sighted, density compensation may explain high local densities of certain other taxa (e.g., Potus flavus and Cuniculus paca). Patterns of differential habitat use between closely related nonvolant species at Paracou were mostly observed within the terrestrial granivore/frugivore guild....

T1  - Scaphitid ammonites of the Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) Fox Hills Formation in South Dakota and Wyoming.

N2  - Well-preserved scaphitid ammonites from the type area of the Upper Cretaceous Fox Hills Formation in north-central South Dakota are the primary focus of this study; also included are scaphites from the uppermost Pierre Shale in this area and from the Fox Hills Formation in the Lance Creek-Red Bird area of eastern Wyoming. The Fox Hills beds represent the marginal marine phase of the progradational sequence marking the final withdrawal of the Cretaceous sea from the Western Interior. Within this marine sequence, which lies above the Baculites clinolobatus Range Zone, the following three range zones based on scaphites are recognized: Jeletzkytes nebrascensis Range Zone; Hoploscaphites nicolletii Range Zone; Hoploscaphites birkelundi Range Zone. Based on recent correlation studies using macro- and microfossils, the H. nicolletii and J. nebrascensis zones equate with the lower Upper Maastrichtian of the European boreal province; the H. birkelundi Zone is either uppermost Lower Maastrichtian or possibly lowermost Upper Maastrichtan. More than 2500 adults and several hundred juveniles were  examined in this study. These specimens fall into three genera: Hoploscaphites Nowak, 1911, Jeletzkytes Riccardi, 1983, and Discoscaphites Meek, 1876. Hoploscaphites includes H. nicolletii (Morton, 1842), H. comprimus (Owen, 1852), H. melloi, n. sp., and H. birkelundi, n. sp. This genus consists of compressed shells with or without ventrolateral tubercles, and less commonly, umbilical tubercles or bullae. Jeletzkytes includes J. spedeni, n. sp., J. nebrascensis (Owen, 1852), and J. dorfi, n. sp. and is characterized by medium to large shells with conspicuous ventrolateral and umbilicolateral tubercles. Discoscaphites includes D. conradi (Morton, 1834), D. gulosus (Morton, 1834), and a micromorphic species, D. rossi, n. sp. This genus consists of small to medium shells with multiple rows of tubercles. A cladistic analysis using the genus Scaphites Parkinson, 1811 as an outgroup indicates that Hoploscaphites and Jeletzkytes are more closely related to each other than either is to Discoscaphites. The excellent preservation of these scaphites permits study of their ontogeny. The embryonic shell or ammonitella is approximately 700 [micrometers] in diameter and exhibits a tuberculate micro-ornamentation. The ammonitella is spheroidal in Hoploscaphites and Jeletzkytes and ellipsoidal in Discoscaphites. The juvenile shell is closely coiled and expands gradually in whorl width and whorl height. There is a slight change at approximately 5 mm shell diameter, coincident with the first appearance of ornament in the form of ribs. Ventrolateral tubercles appear as early as 10-15 mm shell diameter followed by the development of flank tubercles in species of Discoscaphites and Jeletzkytes. Rows of flank tubercles develop in succession from the ventrolateral margin toward the umbilicus. The angular length of the juvenile body chamber averages approximately 240°. The mature shell is not as tightly coiled as that of the juvenile. The body chamber consists of an elongate shaft and recurved hook terminating in a constricted aperture. The change in the shape of the body chamber coincides with a change in the pattern of ornamentation. Large ventrolateral tubercles occur on the shaft in species of Jeletzkytes and in some species of Hoploscaphites. Muscle attachment areas on the body chamber are indicated by thin layers of myostracum preserved on steinkerns. All species are strongly dimorphic at maturity. The average size of macroconchs is significantly larger than that of microconchs, but dimorphs are primarily distinguished on the basis of shape. The body chamber of macroconchs increases abruptly in height, resulting in a nearly straight umbilical shoulder and a relatively small umbilicus whereas the body chamber of microconchs expands only gradually in size; the umbilical shoulder parallels the curve of the venter and the umbilicus is relatively broad. Macroconchs tend to be more sharply differentiated morphologically between species than are microconchs. In species of Hoploscaphites and Discoscaphites, septal approximation occurs over more chambers and is more marked in macroconchs than in microconchs. Macroconchs are more abundant than microconchs in most species. Remains of upper and lower mandibles are associated with all three scaphite genera. The lower mandible is composed of paired, externally convex plates that lie opposite one another, their ventral commissure aligned along the plane of bilateral symmetry. The plates are chitinous with an outer layer of calcite. The upper mandible, which is composed only of chitin, is a single element with two vertical, winglike, lateral parts that converge anteriorly to form a beaklike structure. Like the plates of the lower mandible, wings of the upper mandible are ornamented with concentric ribs that follow finer growth lines. Commonly occurring with mandible remains are hollow chitinous structures consisting of an inverted cup-shaped base 2-5 mm in diameter from which two hornlike projections taper upward to sharp points. Their identification is uncertain but, based on their uniform shape, they may represent hooklike structures rather than radular elements.

T1  - The mid-Tertiary Ctenodactylidae (Rodentia, Mammalia) of eastern and central Asia.
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 234
SP  - 1
N2  - The mid-Tertiary Ctenodactylidae, a profusely ramified rodent of eastern and central Asia, is thoroughly revised based on collections from the Hsanda Gol Formation made in the 1920s by the Third Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, as well as on relatively recently collected material from China. Leptotataromys, Muratkhanomys, and Roborovskia are all synonyms of Tataromys. The species formerly referred to Tataromys are divided into four genera: Tataromys, Yindirtemys, Bounomys, and Euryodontomys, new genus. Thus Tataromys includes only four species: T. plicidens, T. sigmodon, T. minor, and T. parvus, new species. Some species referred to Tataromys (T. grangeri, T. deflexus, T. suni, T. gobiensis, T. cf. T. plicidens, T. cf. T sigmodon of Bohlin (1946) and Zhai (1978), T. cf. T. grangeri, and some Tataromys species) are assigned to Yindirtemys. T. bohlini (partim) and T. ulantatalensis are allotted to Bounomys. T. cf. T. sigmodon and T. bohlini (partim) of Huang (1985) belong to a new genus, Euryodontomys. The mid-Tertiary Ctenodactylidae of Asia falls into four lineages, here considered as four subfamilies. Tataromyinae includes Tataromys, Yindirtemys, and Bounomys; Karakoromys is considered not only a valid genus, but also the representative of a subfamily, Karakoromyinae, which is composed of Karakoromys and Euryodontomys; Ctenodactylinae includes Sayimys, some other fossil genera from the Neogene and Pleistocene, and the living ctenodactylids. This subfamily is thought to be more closely related to the Karakoromyinae than to the Tataromyinae. The family Distylomyidae is here reduced to subfamily rank, Distylomyinae, the sister group of the Ctenodactylinae. Among the four subfamilies, the Tataromyinae, which abruptly flourished during the mid-Tertiary, became extinct by the end of the middle Miocene. On the other hand, the Ctenodactylinae survived and migrated into southern Asia, the Mediterranean area, and North Africa. Now they still survive and live only in North and East Africa. Evolution, radiation, migration, and extinction of the Ctenodactylidae are discussed. The main influential factors are interpreted to be climatic and topographic changes within the Palearctic Region from Eocene through Miocene times.

N2  - Although detailed anatomical descriptions of skull morphology are available for representatives of many mammalian orders, no such descriptive work exists for bats, a group that comprises over 20% of extant mammalian species. In this paper, we provide a detailed description of the skull of Pteropus (Mammalia: Chiroptera: Megachiroptera: Pteropodidae) and establish a system of cranial nomenclature following the Nomina Anatomica Veterinaria. Based on a series of specimens of Pteropus lylei, we describe the skull as a whole and the morphology of external surfaces of 24 bones (7 rostral, 16 cranial, plus the mandible) and 17 teeth. We describe internal surfaces and additional bones of disarticulated skulls of Pteropus livingstonii and use material from the same species to describe the middle ear ossicles and the petrosal bone. We include a description of the hyoid apparatus and larynx based on Pteropus tonganus and a description of the deciduous dentition based on Pteropus hypomelanus. Using a sectioned fetus, we determine the content and homology of all cranial foramina present in the skull of Pteropus. We outline the ontogenetic changes from newborn pups to adults, considering changes in skull shape and the sequence of bone fusion and tooth eruption. Based on selected comparisons to other megabats, we discuss broad patterns of variation in general cranial shape, and interspecific variation in sutures, foramina, processes, and dentition. Overall, this work establishes a descriptive and nomenclatorial benchmark for chiropteran skull anatomy in line with similar works in other mammalian orders, with the aim of creating common ground for comparative, phylogenetic, and functional studies of the bat skull, including comparisons with other mammals.

VL  - 256
SP  - 1
N2  - Hortipes Bosselaers and Ledoux (type species Hortipes luytenae Bosselaers and Ledoux from South Africa) is a genus of small (1.5-4 mm), pale, mainly soil-dwelling spiders from sub-Saharan Africa. The genus, which is tentatively placed in the Liocranidae, is characterized by the presence of a peculiar ellipsoidal array of setae on the dorsal side of metatarsi I and II and by the large anterior median eyes with a dark retina restricted to the median portion. Ledoux and Emerit (1998) described five more species from Ivory Coast and Gabon. Sixty-three additional Hortipes species are described here as new: H. platnicki (female), H. castor (male, female), H. pollux (m., f.), H. fastigiensis (m., f.), H. ostiovolutus (m., f.), H. salticola (m., f.), H. exoptans (m., f.), H. scharffi (m., f.), H. cucurbita (m., f.), H. hesperoecius (f.), H. klumpkeae (f.), H. aurora (m., f.), H. echo (f.), H. stoltzei (m.), H. creber (m., f.), H. orchatocnemis (m., f.), H. contubernalis (m., f.), H. mesembrinus (f.), H. coccinatus (m., f.), H. wimmertensi (m., f.), H. irimus (f.), H. licnophorus (f.), H. schoemanae (m., f.), H. aelurisiepae (f.), H. hyakutake (m.), H. rothorum (m.), H. griswoldi (m.), H. oronesiotes (m., f.), H. penthesileia (f.), H. zombaensis (m., f.), H. atalante (f.), H. merwei (m., f.), H. leno (m., f.), H. mulciber (f.), H. libidinosus (m., f.), H. delphinus (m., f.), H. bjorni (m.), H. amphibolus (f.), H. hastatus (m., f.), H. horta (f.), H. angariopsis (f.), H. falcatus (m., f.), H. lejeunei (m., f.), H. narcissus (m., f.), H. auriga (m.), H. puylaerti (f.), H. chrysothemis (f.), H. machaeropolion (m., f.), H. centralis (f.), H. tarachodes (m., f.), H. terminator (m.), H. baerti (m.), H. robertus (m., f.), H. abucoletus (f.), H. alderweireldti (m.), H. architelones (m., f.), H. calliblepharus (m.), H. fortipes (m.), H. bosmansi (m., f.), H. sceptrum (m., f.), H. anansiodatus (f.), H. hormigricola (m., f.), and H. depravator (m.). The genus has a vast Afrotropical distribution, occurring from as far south as East London in South Africa to Sierra Leone in western Africa. So far, no specimens are available from northeastern tropical Africa. Apart from H. merwei, which seems to prefer grassland, all species are found in leaf litter or the canopy of different kinds of forests and dense thickets. In captivity, H. contubernalis readily fed on Collembola. Specimens raised from cocoons obtained in the laboratory reached adulthood after three molts. A cladistic analysis of the 34 species for which both sexes are known, largely based on secondary genitalic characters, is proposed.

T1  - Phylogenetic systematics of the Borophaginae (Carnivora, Canidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 243
SP  - 1
N2  - The subfamily Borophaginae (Canidae, Carnivora, Mammalia) was erected by G.G. Simpson in 1945 to include seven genera of large, bone-crushing "dogs" in the late Tertiary of the northern continents. As a monophyletic group of canids, the Borophaginae is now known to be much more diverse than was originally envisioned but is confined within the middle to late Tertiary of North America. Fossil records of the borophagines are well represented and members of this prolific clade are often the most common predators in the late Tertiary deposits.  Largely due to the Childs Frick Collection at the American Museum of Natural History, borophagines are represented by some of the best materials among fossil carnivorans in anatomical representation, sample size, and stratigraphic density. As a result of this explosive growth of new information, borophagine systematics is now in need of a complete rethinking at a level that could not have been attempted by previous studies.  A detailed study of borophagine phylogenetic systematics is presented here, publishing for the first time the entire Frick Collection. A total of 66 species of borophagines, including 18 new species, ranging from Orellan through Blancan ages,  are presently recognized. A phylogenetic analysis of these species is performed using cladistic methods, with Hesperocyoninae, an archaic group of canids, as an outgroup. At its base, the Borophaginae has a sister relationship with the subfamily Caninae, which includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives. The Borophaginae-Caninae clade is in turn derived from the subfamily Hesperocyoninae.  Apart from some transitional forms, most of the Borophaginae can be organized in four major clades (all erected as new tribes or subtribes): Phlaocyonini, Cynarctina, Aelurodontina, and Borophagina. The Borophaginae begins with a group of small fox-sized genera, such as Archaeocyon, Oxetocyon, Otarocyon, and Rhizocyon, in the Orellan through early Arikareean. Relationships among these genera are difficult to resolve due to their primitiveness. Slightly more derived,  but still near the base of the Borophaginae, is the Phlaocyonini, a hypocarnivorous clade of the Arikareean and Hemingfordian that includes Cynarctoides and Phlaocyon. These two genera represent divergent approaches toward hypocarnivory. Species of Cynarctoides trend toward selenodonty and remain small in size, whereas species of Phlaocyon specialize toward bunodont dentitions but of increasing size, with an unusual trend toward hypercarnivory by two terminal species in the clade.  Four transitional taxa (species of Cormocyon and Desmocyon) occupy intermediate positions between the Phlaocyonini and Cynarctina, and represent a gradual size increase toward medium-size individuals. The subtribe Cynarctina, the second hypocarnivorous clade, includes Paracynarctus and Cynarctus in the Hemingfordian through Clarendonian, and represents a larger size group than the Phlaocyonini, although there is a tendency toward size reduction among advanced species of Cynarctus. The cynarctines feature the most bunodont dentition known among canids.  The next series of transitional taxa (Metatomarctus, Euoplocyon, Psalidocyon, Microtomarctus, Protomarctus, and Tephrocyon) are of medium size and occupy a pectinated sequence that contains a rather diverse set of dental morphology. These include the most hypercarnivorous borophagine Euoplocyon, the peculiarly trenchant Psalidocyon, and the dwarf lineage Microtomarctus. The next clade, Aelurodontina, is the first major hypercarnivorous group and is represented by Tomarctus and Aelurodon in the Barstovian and Clarendonian. The aelurodontines evolve around a more consistent theme of increasingly more hypercarnivorous dentitions with strong premolars, forming a rather linear series from Tomarctus to various species of Aelurodon.  The terminal clade Borophagina, sister to the Aelurodontina, begins with the mostly mesocarnivorous Paratomarctus and Carpocyon in the late Barstovian through late Hemphillian. The terminal species of Carpocyon, C. limosus, shows some hypocarnivorous adaptations. Protepicyon in the Barstovian initiates the hypercarnivorous trend in the terminal clade. Epicyon, the largest known canid, is the dominant predator in the Clarendonian and Hemphillian. Finally, an enlarged concept of Borophagus consists of a series of pectinated species terminated by B. diversidens in the late Blancan. Epicyon and Borophagus are the most highly evolved in their capacity to crush bones.  Phylogenetic reconstruction was greatly aided by the high quality of fossil records and the large number of transitional forms. The latter ensures a morphological continuity that facilitates the identification of homoplasies that otherwise could easily be mistaken as synapomorphies. Confidence in the phylogeny is further enhanced by a high congruence between the cladistic rank and the stratigraphic sequence. The temporal and morphological continuity in many borophagine lineages also permits further postulation about their evolutionary processes, such as cladogenetic and anagenetic events.  Our considerably enlarged concept of the Borophaginae indicates a much broader trophic diversity than has previously been envisioned. In addition to the commonly recognized hyenalike forms, members of the Borophaginae acquired a wider spectrum of morphologies that surpassed either the hesperocyonine or canine canids. The Borophaginae played broad ecological roles that are performed by at least three living carnivoran families, Canidae, Hyaenidae, and Procyonidae.

SP  - 1
N2  - More than 775 nomenclatural changes are proposed and nomenclatural problems are discussed for the Staphylinidae. Two generic names are proposed as replacement names: Torobus for species formerly in Trigonopselaphus, and Ryvkinius for the preoccupied Mesoporus Ryvkin. Type species are fixed or problems with the type species are discussed for: Entomoculia, Eumegalopsidia (an unavailable name), Anthobium, Lesteva, Phyllodrepoidea, Aleioglyphesthus, Bolitogyrus, Cephalonthus, Diatrechus, Euremus, Indoquedius, Philothalpus, Philonthopsis, Pseudoremus, Leptophius, Stenus (Nestus), Coproporus, and Paratachinus. The type species for Entomoculia, Anthobium, Phyllodrepoidea, Leptophius, and Stenus (Nestus) are fixed under provisions of article 70.3 of the Code. Emendations are cited or one of multiple original spellings adopted in Bledius, Bryoporus, Carpelimus, Edaphus, Eleusis, Gauropterus, Indosorius, Lispinus, Lithocharodes, Medon, Osorius, Philonthus, Piestus, Pinophilinus, Platydracus, Priochirus, Prognathoides, Quedius, Stenus, and Trigonuras. New combinations are proposed in Arrhenopeplus (3), Dialycera (2), Eusphalerum (14), Nacaeus (19), Pseudoxyporus (4), Homalotrichus (1), Thinodromus (2), Gabrius (1), Platydracus (57), Torobus (9), Bryophacis (7), Ischnosoma (16), Lordithon (66), Ryvkinius (1), and Sepedophilus (244). Fifty-nine new synonyms are listed for Micropeplus (1), Anthophagus (2), Eusphalerum (1), Phloeonomus (1), Eleusis (1), Leptochirus (1), Neolosus (1), Osorius (5), Priochirus (1), Anotylus (1), Bledius (1), Carpelimus (1), Ochthephilus (1), Apoquedius (1), Diatrechus (1), Erichsonius (2), Gabrius (2), Gastrisus (1), Hesperus (2), Heterothops (2), Leptacinus (1), Notolinus (1), Phallolinus (1), Philonthus (6), Quedius (5), Staphylinus (2), Tasgius (1) Xantholinus (4), Stenus (7), Sepedophilus (1), and Tachinus (1). Polyphematiana E. Strand is a junior synonym of Trigonopselaphus Gemminger and Harold. Eleven names are resurrected from synonymy, one each in Phyllodrepoidea, Anotylus, Oxytelus, Loncovilius, Philonthus, Platydracus, Lordithon, Mycetoporus, and Tachinus and two in Stenus. Under provisions of article 23.9.1 of the Code, 28 junior synonyms are protected in Amphichroum (1), Carpelimus (1), Deleaster (1), Proteinus (1), Bisnius (1), Leptacinus (1), Megalinus (1), Neobisnius (1), Ocypus (1), Philonthus (3), Quedius (4), Tasgius (2), Stenus (5), Bolitobius (1), Lordithon (1), Mycetoporus (1), and Tachyporus (2). Provisions of the same article protect 5 junior homonyms in Eusphalerum (1), Xylodromus (1), Quedius (1), Tachinus (1), and Tachyporus (1). Under provisions of article 23.9.3 of the Code, 15 junior synonyms will be referred to the Commission for rulings under the plenary power. Pending the outcome of these cases, use of the junior name is maintained. The affected species are in Eusphalerum (1), Lesteva (1), Omalium (1), Phloeostiba (1), Xylodromus (1), Anotylus (1), Bledius (1), Carpelimus (1), Ocypus (1), Philonthus (1), Quedius (4), and Lordithon (1). Under provisions of article 23.9.5 of the Code, 64 junior primary homonyms will be referred to the Commission for rulings under the plenary power. Pending the outcome of these deliberations, use of the junior name is maintained. The species are in Eusphalerum (1), Mannerheimia (1), Omaliomimus (1), Omaliopsis (1), Omalium (4), Phyllodrepa (1), Pycnoglypta (1), Xylodromus (1), Anotylus (1), Bledius (1), Carpelimus (1), Oxyporus (1), Belonuchus (2), Bisnius (1), Cafius (2), Cheilocolpus (1), Diatrechus (1), Endeius (1), Gabrius (5), Hesperus (2), Leptacinus (1), Nordus (1), Paederomimus (1), Philonthus (10), Platydracus (3), Quedius (2), Staphylinus (6), Xantholinus (2), Xanthopygus (1), Xenopygus (2), Carphacis (1), Coproporus (1), Tachinomorphus (1), and Tachinus (3). Replacement names are proposed for 90 preoccupied names in 37 genera: Euaesthetus (1), Leptotyphlus (1), Micropeplus (1), Eusphalerum (2), Lesteva (1), Olophrum (1), Omalium (2), Clavilispinus (1), Eleusis (3), Holotrochus (3), Leptochirus (1), Lispinus (4), Osorius (3), Priochirus (2), Thoracochirus (1), Anotylus (2), Carpelimus (2), Platystethus (1), Atanygnathus (1), Bisnius (1), Diochus (1), Gabrius (3), Hesperus (2), Heterothops (1), Leptacinus (3), Philonthus (19), Quedius (4), Staphylinus (3), Tasgius (1), Dianous (1), Bolitobius (1), Carphacis (1), Coproporus (3), Lordithon (3), Sepedophilus (5), Tachinus (4), Tachyporus (1). Eight names are resurrected to replace preoccupied names in Anotylus (1), Philonthus (1), Quedius (1), Stenus (2), Lordithon (1), Tachinomorphus (1), and Tachinus (1). Twenty-six senior homonyms, in Hapalaraea (1), Omalium (2), Phyllodrepa (1), Bledius (1), Oxytelus (1), Bisnius (1), Quedius (1), Staphylinus (15), Carphacis (1), Sepedophilus (1), and Tachinus (1), are regarded to be 'nomina dubia' and the junior names conserved by fiat, without sanction by the Code. Psephidonus is the older name, but application to the Commission will be made to reject that name in favor of the younger Geodromicus. Tachyporiniformes is an unavailable name.

VL  - 296

N2  - In this study I provide a phylogenetic hypothesis for the tribe Oryzomyini that can be used to understand the diversification and evolution of this group of rodents and to revise the current generic-level classification. Morphological and molecular data were used for these purposes in combined and separate analyses. Molecular data consisted of partial sequences (1266 bp) from the first exon of the nuclear gene encoding the interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP); the morphological matrix comprised 99 characters, including 16 integumental characters, 32 skull characters, 29 dental characters, 7 postcranial characters, and 10 characters from the phallus and soft-anatomy systems. I present anatomical descriptions for each character, including delineation of different states observed among oryzomyines. Results of the combined analysis were congruent with the IRBP-only dataset for oryzomyine higher-level relationships. Morphological analyses, although showing discrepancies from the combined or IRBP consensus cladograms and with low nodal support values, recovered several clades similar to the combined and IRBP analyses. Systematics of the tribe and the evolution of a few pivotal characters are discussed in light of the proposed phylogeny. Different taxonomic arrangements for species currently included in the genus Oryzomys are suggested. Finally, I evaluate evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses that are compatible with our current knowledge on oryzomyine relationships.

SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 297

N2  - The evidentiary basis of the currently accepted classification of living amphibians is discussed and shown not to warrant the degree of authority conferred on it by use and tradition. A new taxonomy of living amphibians is proposed to correct the deficiencies of the old one. This new taxonomy is based on the largest phylogenetic analysis of living Amphibia so far accomplished. We combined the comparative anatomical character evidence of Haas (2003) with DNA sequences from the mitochondrial transcription unit H1 (12S and 16S ribosomal RNA and tRNA[superscript Valine] genes, [approximately equal to] 2,400 bp of mitochondrial sequences) and the nuclear genes histone H3, rhodopsin, tyrosinase, and seven in absentia, and the large ribosomal subunit 28S ([approximately equal to] 2,300 bp of nuclear sequences; ca. 1.8 million base pairs; x [arithmetic mean] = 3.7 kb/terminal). The dataset includes 532 terminals sampled from 522 species representative of the global diversity of amphibians as well as seven of the closest living relatives of amphibians for outgroup comparisons. The primary purpose of our taxon sampling strategy was to provide strong tests of the monophyly of all 'family-group' taxa. All currently recognized nominal families and subfamilies were sampled, with the exception of Protohynobiinae (Hynobiidae). Many of the currently recognized genera were also sampled. Although we discuss the monophyly of genera, and provide remedies for nonmonophyly where possible, we also make recommendations for future research. A parsimony analysis was performed under Direct Optimization, which simultaneously optimizes nucleotide homology (alignment) and tree costs, using the same set of assumptions throughout the analysis. Multiple search algorithms were run in the program POY over a period of seven months of computing time on the AMNH Parallel Computing Cluster. Results demonstrate that the following major taxonomic groups, as currently recognized, are nonmonophyletic: Ichthyophiidae (paraphyletic with respect to Uraeotyphlidae), Caeciliidae (paraphyletic with respect to Typhlonectidae and Scolecomorphidae), Salamandroidea (paraphyletic with respect to Sirenidae), Leiopelmatanura (paraphyletic with respect to Ascaphidae), Discoglossanura (paraphyletic with respect to Bombinatoridae), Mesobatrachia (paraphyletic with respect to Neobatrachia), Pipanura (paraphyletic with respect to Bombinatoridae and Discoglossidae/Alytidae), Hyloidea (in the sense of containing Heleophrynidae; paraphyletic with respect to Ranoidea), Leptodactylidae (polyphyletic, with Batrachophrynidae forming the sister taxon of Myobatrachidae + Limnodynastidae, and broadly paraphyletic with respect to Hemiphractinae, Rhinodermatidae, Hylidae, Allophrynidae, Centrolenidae, Brachycephalidae, Dendrobatidae, and Bufonidae), Microhylidae (polyphyletic, with Brevicipitinae being the sister taxon of Hemisotidae), Microhylinae (poly/paraphyletic with respect to the remaining non-brevicipitine microhylids), Hyperoliidae (para/polyphyletic, with Leptopelinae forming the sister taxon of Arthroleptidae + Astylosternidae), Astylosternidae (paraphyletic with respect to Arthroleptinae), Ranidae (paraphyletic with respect to Rhacophoridae and Mantellidae). In addition, many subsidiary taxa are demonstrated to be nonmonophyletic, such as (1) Eleutherodactylus with respect to Brachycephalus; (2) Rana (sensu Dubois, 1992), which is polyphyletic, with various elements falling far from each other on the tree; and (3) Bufo, with respect to several nominal bufonid genera. A new taxonomy of living amphibians is proposed, and the evidence for this is presented to promote further investigation and data acquisition bearing on the evolutionary history of amphibians. The taxonomy provided is consistent with the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999). Salient features of the new taxonomy are (1) the three major groups of living amphibians, caecilians/Gymnophiona, salamanders/Caudata, and frogs/Anura, form a monophyletic group, to which we restrict the name Amphibia; (2) Gymnophiona forms the sister taxon of Batrachia (salamanders + frogs) and is composed of two groups, Rhinatrematidae and Stegokrotaphia; (3) Stegokrotaphia is composed of two families, Ichthyophiidae (including Uraeotyphlidae) and Caeciliidae (including Scolecomorphidae and Typhlonectidae, which are regarded as subfamilies); (4) Batrachia is a highly corroborated monophyletic group, composed of two taxa, Caudata (salamanders) and Anura (frogs); (5) Caudata is composed of two taxa, Cryptobranchoidei (Cryptobranchidae and Hynobiidae) and Diadectosalamandroidei new taxon (all other salamanders); (6) Diadectosalamandroidei is composed of two taxa, Hydatinosalamandroidei new taxon (composed of Perennibranchia and Treptobranchia new taxon) and Plethosalamandroidei new taxon; (7) Perennibranchia is composed of Proteidae and Sirenidae; (8) Treptobranchia new taxon is composed of two taxa, Ambystomatidae (including Dicamptodontidae) and Salamandridae; (9) Plethosalamandroidei new taxon is composed of Rhyacotritonidae and Xenosalamandroidei new taxon; (10) Xenosalamandroidei is composed of Plethodontidae and Amphiumidae; (11) Anura is monophyletic and composed of two clades, Leiopelmatidae (including Ascaphidae) and Lalagobatrachia new taxon (all other frogs); (12) Lalagobatrachia is composed of two clades, Xenoanura (Pipidae and Rhinophrynidae) and Sokolanura new taxon (all other lalagobatrachians); (13) Bombinatoridae and Alytidae (former Discoglossidae) are each others' closest relatives and in a clade called Costata, which, excluding Leiopelmatidae and Xenoanura, forms the sister taxon of all other frogs, Acosmanura; (14) Acosmanura is composed of two clades, Anomocoela (5 Pelobatoidea of other authors) and Neobatrachia; (15) Anomocoela contains Pelobatoidea (Pelobatidae and Megophryidae) and Pelodytoidea (Pelodytidae and Scaphiopodidae), and forms the sister taxon of Neobatrachia, together forming Acosmanura; (16) Neobatrachia is composed of two clades, Heleophrynidae, and all other neobatrachians, Phthanobatrachia new taxon; (17) Phthanobatrachia is composed of two major units, Hyloides and Ranoides; (18) Hyloides comprises Sooglossidae (including Nasikabatrachidae) and Notogaeanura new taxon (the remaining hyloids); (19) Notogaeanura contains two taxa, Australobatrachia new taxon and Nobleobatrachia new taxon; (20) Australobatrachia is a clade composed of Batrachophrynidae and its sister taxon, Myobatrachoidea (Myobatrachidae and Limnodynastidae), which forms the sister taxon of all other hyloids, excluding sooglossids; (21) Nobleobatrachia new taxon, is dominated at its base by frogs of a treefrog morphotype, several with intercalary phalangeal cartilages--Hemiphractus (Hemiphractidae) forms the sister taxon of the remaining members of this group, here termed Meridianura new taxon; (22) Meridianura comprises Brachycephalidae (former Eleutherodactylinae + Brachycephalus) and Cladophrynia new taxon; (23) Cladophrynia is composed of two groups, Cryptobatrachidae (composed of Cryptobatrachus and Stefania, previously a fragment of the polyphyletic Hemiphractinae) and Tinctanura new taxon; (24) Tinctanura is composed of Amphignathodontidae (Gastrotheca and Flectonotus, another fragment of the polyphyletic Hemiphractinae) and Athesphatanura new taxon; (25) Athesphatanura is composed of Hylidae (Hylinae, Pelodryadinae, and Phyllomedusinae, and excluding former Hemiphractinae, whose inclusion would have rendered this taxon polyphyletic) and Leptodactyliformes new taxon;

N2  - The Australasian ground spiders belonging to the family Prodidomidae are monographed; although only ten species were previously known from the region, the fauna is extraordinarily diverse, encompassing at least seven genera and 138 species. Two generic names are newly synonymized: Hyltonia Birabén with Prodidomus Hentz, and Honunius Simon with Molycria Simon. The type species of the family, Prodidomus rufus Hentz, although originally described from Alabama, is apparently synanthropic and hence widespread; Prodidomus gulosus (Simon) from New Caledonia, Prodidomus imaidzumii Kishida from Japan, and Hyltonia scottae Birabén from Argentina are newly synonymized with P. rufus, and the species is newly recorded from Chile and St. Helena. Seven new species of Prodidomus are described from Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and Queensland. The females of Molycria mammosa (O. P.-Cambridge) and Molycria quadricauda (Simon) are described for the first time, and 34 new species of Molycria are described. The new genus Wydundra is described for 40 new Australian species, and Molycria voc Deeleman-Reinhold, from Malaysia and the Moluccas, is transferred to Wydundra. Molycria splendida Simon is transferred to the new genus Wesmaldra, its male is described for the first time, and 13 new species of Wesmaldra are described from Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Molycria flavipes Simon is transferred to the new genus Nomindra, its male is newly described, Molycria alboplagiata Simon is newly synonymized with that name, and 15 new species of Nomindra are described. The male of Cryptoerithus occultus Rainbow is described for the first time, and 18 new species are assigned to Cryptoerithus. Adult males and females of Myandra cambridgei Simon are described for the first time, as are two new species of Myandra.

T1  - Phylogenetic systematics of dart-poison frogs and their relatives (Amphibia, Athesphatanura, Dendrobatidae).
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 299
SP  - 1
N2  - The known diversity of dart-poison frog species has grown from 70 in the 1960s to 247 at present, with no sign that the discovery of new species will wane in the foreseeable future. Although this growth in knowledge of the diversity of this group has been accompanied by detailed investigations of many aspects of the biology of dendrobatids, their phylogenetic relationships remain poorly understood. This study was designed to test hypotheses of dendrobatid diversification by combining new and prior genotypic and phenotypic evidence in a total evidence analysis. DNA sequences were sampled for five mitochondrial and six nuclear loci (approximately 6,100 base pairs [bp]; å[arithmetic mean] = 53,740 bp per terminal; total dataset composed of approximately 1.55 million bp), and 174 phenotypic characters were scored from adult and larval morphology, alkaloid profiles, and behavior. These data were combined with relevant published DNA sequences. Ingroup sampling targeted several previously unsampled species, including Aromobates nocturnus, which was hypothesized previously to be the sister of all other dendrobatids. Undescribed and problematic species were sampled from multiple localities when possible. The final dataset consisted of 414 terminals: 367 ingroup terminals of 156 species and 47 outgroup terminals of 46 species. Direct optimization parsimony analysis of the equally weighted evidence resulted in 25,872 optimal trees. Forty nodes collapse in the strict consensus, with all conflict restricted to conspecific terminals. Dendrobatids were recovered as monophyletic, and their sister group consisted of Crossodactylus, Hylodes, and Megaelosia, recognized herein as Hylodidae. Among outgroup taxa, Centrolenidae was found to be the sister group of all athesphatanurans except Hylidae, Leptodactyidae was polyphyletic, Thoropa was nested within Cycloramphidae, and Ceratophryinae was paraphyletic with respect to Telmatobiinae. Among dendrobatids, the monophyly and content of Mannophryne and Phyllobates were corroborated. Aromobates nocturnus and Colostethus saltuensis were found to be nested within Nephelobates, and Minyobates was paraphyletic and nested within Dendrobates. Colostethus was shown to be rampantly nonmonophyletic, with most species falling into two unrelated cis- and trans-Andean clades. A morphologically and behaviorally diverse clade of median lingual process-possessing species was discovered. In light of these findings and the growth in knowledge of the diversity of this large clade over the past 40 years, we propose a new, monophyletic taxonomy for dendrobatids, recognizing the inclusive clade as a superfamily (Dendrobatoidea) composed of two families (one of which is new), six subfamilies (three new), and 16 genera (four new). Although poisonous frogs did not form a monophyletic group, the three poisonous lineages are all confined to the revised family Dendrobatidae, in keeping with the traditional application of this name. We also propose changes to achieve a monophyletic higher-level taxonomy for the athesphatanuran outgroup taxa. Analysis of character evolution revealed multiple origins of phytotelm-breeding, parental provisioning of nutritive oocytes for larval consumption (larval oophagy), and endotrophy. Available evidence indicates that transport of tadpoles on the dorsum of parent nurse frogs--a dendrobatid synapomorphy--is carried out primitively by male nurse frogs, with three independent origins of female transport and five independent origins of biparental transport. Reproductive amplexus is optimally explained as having been lost in the most recent common ancestor of Dendrobatoidea, with cephalic amplexus arising independently three times.

T1  - Evolution of the side-necked turtles : the families Bothremydidae, Euraxemydidae, and Araripemydidae 
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 300
SP  - 1
N2  - Although pleurodires have been considered significantly less diverse than their sister group, the cryptodires, current discoveries show that pleurodires had a more complex and extensive evolutionary history than had been realized. Previously unknown radiations, particularly in the near-shore marine realm, are revealed by taxa with diverse cranial morphology, indicating many different feeding and sensory strategies. The pleurodire group that is changed the most by the new discoveries is its largest group, the hyperfamily Pelomedusoides. The hyperfamily Pelomedusoides now consists of the families Pelomedusidae, Podocnemididae, Bothremydidae, Araripemydidae, and Euraxemydidae, new family. The families Bothremydidae, Araripemydidae, and Euraxemydidae, new family, are documented with descriptions of skulls, lower jaws, and shells. The relationships of the family Podocnemididae to its sister taxa Hamadachelys and Brasilemys are recognized by placing them in the epifamily Podocnemidinura. The epifamily Podocnemidinura is the sister group to the family Bothremydidae, and together they form the superfamily Podocnemidoidea. The family Araripemydidae consists of one taxon, Araripemys barretoi, from the Aptian-Albian of Brazil. Description of new cranial material suggests that it is the sister group to all other Pelomedusoides or the sister group to the Pelomedusidae, but these relationships are only weakly supported. There is strong support for a multichotomy of Araripemys, Pelomedusidae, and remaining Pelomedusoides. Araripemys is characterized by very thin triturating surfaces and by a shell that lacks mesoplastra and has the first costals reaching the shell margin. The new family Euraxemydidae consists of two new genera: Euraxemys essweini, n. gen. et sp., from the Albian Santana Formation of Brazil, and Dirqadim schaefferi, n. gen. et sp., from the Cenomanian Kem Kem beds of Morocco. Members of the Euraxemydidae are united by the unique possession of a medial process of the quadrate partially covering the prootic and narrowly contacting a ventral process of the exoccipital, in contrast to all other pleurodires, which have either complete exposure or complete covering of the prootic ventrally. Furthermore, members have a ventral process of the exoccipital that is exposed at the lateral margin of the basioccipital in an elongate foot. The Euraxemydidae is hypothesized as the sister group to the superfamily Podocnemidoidea. The family Bothremydidae and the epifamily Podocnemidinura (consisting of the family Podocnemididae, Hamadachelys, and Brasilemys) are united as the superfamily Podocnemidoidea based on the possession of a quadrate-basioccipital contact, the complete or nearly complete ventral covering of the prootic, and the extension of the pectoral scales onto the entoplastron. The family Bothremydidae is a large and diverse group extending from the Albian to the Eocene in North and South America, Europe, Africa, and India. Its monophyly is supported by the presence of a wide exoccipital-quadrate contact, a eustachian tube separated from the incisura columellae auris usually by bone to form a bony canal for the stapes, absence of a fossa precolumellaris, a supraoccipital--quadrate contact (except in the tribe Taphrosphyini), and a posterior enlargement of the fossa orbitalis. Although there is a diversity of triturating surfaces within the family, primitively bothremydids have a posteriorly wide triturating surface with a significant palatine contribution in the upper jaw. The family Bothremydidae consists of four newly recognized, monophyletic groups: the tribes Kurmademydini, Cearachelyini, Bothremydini, and Taphrosphyini. The tribe Kurmademydini consists of two taxa: Kurmademys kallamedensis, from the Maastrichtian Kallamedu Formation of India, and Sankuchemys sethnai, from the Maastrichtian Intertrappean beds of India. The tribe Kurmademydini is characterized by extensive temporal and cheek emargination, a large fossa precolumellaris, and a small, anterior exposure of the prootic on the ventral surface. The tribe Kurmademydini is the sister group to the subfamily Bothremydinae (consisting of the tribes Cearachelyini, Bothremydini, and Taphrosphyini). Members of the subfamily Bothremydinae all possess a foramen stapedio-temporale that faces anteriorly. The tribe Cearachelyini consists of Cearachelys placidoi, from the Albian Santana Formation of Brazil, and Galianemys emringeri and Galianemys whitei, both from the Cenomanian Kem Kem beds of Morocco. The tribe Cearachelyini is characterized by a jugal retracted from the orbital margin and a fenestra postotica formed into a short slit. The tribe Cearachelyini is the sister group to the infrafamily Bothremydodda (consisting of the tribes Bothremydini and Taphrosphyini). The infrafamily Bothremydodda is characterized by a quadrate shelf formed below the cavum tympani, a foramen stapedio-temporale and foramen nervi trigemini that are very close together on the anterior face of the otic chamber, and a condylus occipitalis and occipital neck that are formed only by the exoccipitals. The tribe Bothremydini consists of Foxemys mechinorum, from the Campanian-Maastrichtian of France; Polysternon provinciale, from the Campanian of Europe; Zolhafah bella, from the Maastrichtian Dakla Formation of Egypt; Rosasia soutoi, from the Campanian-Maastrichtian of Portugal; Araiochelys hirayamai, n. gen. et sp., from the Danian phosphates of Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco; Bothremys cooki, from the Maastrichtian Navesink Formation of New Jersey; Bothremys maghrebiana, n. sp., from the Danian phosphates of Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco; Bothremys kellyi, n. sp., from the Ypresian phosphates of Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco; Bothremys arabicus, from the Santonian of Jordan; Chedighaii hutchisoni, n. gen. et sp., from the Campanian Kirtland Formation of New Mexico; and Chedighaii barberi, n. gen., from the Campanian of Arkansas, Alabama, Kansas, and New Jersey. The tribe Bothremydini is the sister group to the tribe Taphrosphyini. The tribe Taphrosphyini is characterized by the presence of a jugal-quadrate contact, the absence of a maxilla-quadratojugal contact, and the absence of a supraoccipital-quadrate contact. Members of the tribe Taphrosphyini have a considerable variety of triturating surfaces but they lack the wide, triangular surfaces typical of the other bothremydids. The tribe Taphrosphyini consists of Taphrosphys sulcatus, from the Danian Hornerstown Formation of New Jersey; Taphrosphys congolensis, from the Paleocene of Cabinda, west Africa; Taphrosphys ippolitoi, n. sp., from the Danian phosphates of the Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco; Labrostochelys galkini, n. gen. et sp., from the Danian phosphates of the Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco; Phosphatochelys tedfordi, from the Ypresian phosphates of the Ouled Abdoun Basin Morocco; Ummulisani rutgersensis, n. gen. et sp., from the Ypresian phosphates of the Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco; Rhothonemys brinkmani, n. gen. et sp., from the Paleogene phosphates of the Ouled Abdoun Basin, Morocco; Azabbaremys moragjonesi, from the Paleocene Teberemt Formation of Mali; Nigeremys gigantea, from the Maastrichtian of Niger; and Arenila krebsi, from the Maastrichtian Dakla Formation of Egypt. Among the Bothremydidae, the Taphrosphyini is the most diverse morphologically. The triturating surfaces show a wide range of variation. The long, narrow skull of Labrostochelys differs significantly from the very short skull of Phosphatochelys. Other genera, such as Azabbaremys and Arenila, have large and massive skulls, but without broadly expanded triturating surfaces, while Ummulisani has very narrow and deep labial ridges. The nasal regions of Taphrosphyini also show wide diversity. Rhothonemys has nasal openings and cavities more than twice the size of the orbits, but the nasal openings in Labrostochelys are smaller than the relatively small orbits. This diversity of Taphrosphyini skull morphology is mostly evident in the Paleogene of North Africa. A phylogenetic analysis of the core dataset of 41 taxa, 122 cranial characters, and 52 postcranial characters relies on comparative descriptions of these taxa. The analysis using PAUP results in one most parsimonious cladogram of 382 steps with a consistency index of 0.6. A Bremer decay analysis shows that the family Bothremydidae is strongly supported at five steps: the tribes Kurmademydini and Cearachelyini have an index of 2, and the tribe Taphrosphyini has an index of 3. The tribe Bothremydini becomes unresolved at one step and is the most weakly supported of these groups. The addition of selected shell-only taxa with low missing data values to the core dataset results in one equally parsimonious cladogram that is resolved as: (Proterochersis (Platychelyidae (Dortoka (Chelidae (Pelomedusidae + Araripemys) (Euraxemydidae (Teneremys (Podocnemididae + Hamadachelys + Brasilemys (Bothremydidae)))))))). A partitioned dataset consisting only of cranial characters (excluding all shell-only taxa) results in one equally parsimonious cladogram identical to the most parsimonious cladogram resulting from the whole dataset; however, a partitioned dataset consisting only of postcranial characters (excluding all skull-only taxa) resulted in 2704 trees, the consensus of which lacks resolution for nearly all Pelomedusoides, but which does resolve more basal pleurodires. When the skull morphology of the Bothremydidae is placed in the context of all other turtles, it becomes apparent that this family has the greatest range of skull forms of any turtle family yet known. In fact, the skull morphologies of many turtle families seem remarkably uniform in comparison (e.g., Testudinidae, Kinosternidae, Pelomedusidae, Trionychidae, Carettochelyidae).

T1  - The anatomy of Effigia okeeffeae (Archosauria, Suchia), theropod-like convergence, and the distribution of related taxa 
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 302
SP  - 1
N2  - Effigia okeeffeae is named based on a well-preserved nearly complete skeleton from the Upper Triassic (?Rhaetian) 'siltstone member' at Ghost Ranch, northern New Mexico. The skull is described and compared to other suchian and basal archosaurs. The maxilla and premaxilla are edentulous, and a rhamphotheca was possibly present in life. Effigia conclusively indicates that the skull of Shuvosaurus and the postcrania of 'Chatterjeea' belong to the same taxon. Furthermore, the close relationship between Shuvosaurus and Effigia indicates that both taxa are nested within the suchian clade and not within Ornithomimisauria. However, the similarity in features in the skull and postcrania of Effigia and ornithomimids suggests extreme convergence occurred between the two clades. A clade containing Arizonasaurus, Bromsgroveia, Poposaurus, Sillosuchus, Shuvosaurus, andEffigia is suggested based solely on shared derived character states. Additionally, a clade (Clade Y) containing Sillosuchus, Shuvosaurus, and Effigia is well supported by further derived character states. The distribution and temporal pattern of members of Group Y suggest that members of Group Y are present in the early Middle Triassic through the latest Triassic of North America, and one member of the clade, Sillosuchus, was present in South America.

T1  - Cephalopods from the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary interval on the Atlantic Coastal Plain, with a description of the highest ammonite zones in North America. Part 3, Manasquan River Basin, Monmouth County, New Jersey 
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 303
SP  - 1
N2  - Geological investigations in the upper Manasquan River Basin, central Monmouth County, New Jersey, reveal a Cretaceous/Tertiary (= Cretaceous/Paleogene) succession consisting of approximately 2 m of the Tinton Formation overlain by 2 m of the Hornerstown Formation. The top of the Tinton Formation consists of a very fossiliferous unit, approximately 20 cm thick, which we refer to as the Pinna Layer. It is laterally extensive and consists mostly of glauconitic minerals and some angular quartz grains. The Pinna Layer is truncated at the top and is overlain by the Hornerstown Formation, which consists of nearly equal amounts of glauconitic minerals and siderite. The base of the Hornerstown Formation is marked by a concentration of siderite nodules containing reworked fossils. This layer also contains a few fossils of organisms that were living in the environment during the time of reworking. At some downdip sites, there is an additional layer (the Burrowed Unit), which is sandwiched between the top of the Pinna Layer and the concentrated bed of nodules. This unit is very thin and is characterized by large burrows piping down material from above. The Pinna Layer is abundantly fossiliferous and represents a diverse, nearshore marine community. It contains approximately 110 species of bivalves, gastropods, cephalopods, echinoids, sponges, annelids, bryozoans, crustaceans, and dinoflagellates. The cephalopods include Eutrephoceras dekayi (Morton, 1834), Pachydiscus (Neodesmoceras) mokotibensis Collignon, 1952, Sphenodiscus lobatus (Tuomey, 1856), Eubaculites carinatus (Morton, 1834), Eubaculites latecarinatus (Brunnschweiler, 1966), Discoscaphites iris (Conrad, 1858), Discoscaphites sphaeroidalis Kennedy and Cobban, 2000, Discoscaphites minardi Landman et al., 2004b, Discoscaphites gulosus (Morton, 1834), and Discoscaphites jerseyensis, n.sp. The dinoflagellates include Palynodinium grallator Gocht, 1970, Thalassiphora pelagica (Eisenack, 1954) Eisenack & Gocht, 1960, Deflandrea galeata (Lejeune-Carpentier, 1942) Lentin & Williams, 1973, and Disphaerogena carposphaeropsis Wetzel, 1933. These ammonites and dinoflagellates are indicative of the uppermost Maastrichtian, corresponding to the upper part of calcareous nannofossil Subzone CC26b. The mode of occurrence of the fossils in the Pinna Layer suggests an autochthonous accumulation with little or no postmortem transport. Many of the benthic organisms are preserved in life position. For example, specimens of Pinna laqueata Conrad, 1858, are oriented in a vertical position, similar to that of modern members of this genus. The echinoids also occur in aggregations of hundreds of individuals, suggesting gregarious feeding behavior. In addition, there are monospecific clusters of baculites and scaphites. These clusters are biological in origin and could not have been produced by hydraulic means. Scaphite jaws are also present, representing the first reports of these structures in the Upper Cretaceous of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. They occur both as isolated specimens and inside the body chamber, and indicate little or no postmortem transport. The Pinna Layer represents a geologically short interval of time. The fact that most of the animals are mature suggests that the community persisted for at least 5-10 years. If multiple generations of animals are present, perhaps reflecting multiple episodes of colonization and burial, then this unit probably represents more time, amounting to several tens of years. The fact that the Pinna Layer is truncated at the top implies a still longer period of time, amounting to hundreds of years. These age estimates are consistent with observed rates of sedimentation in nearshore environments. Iridium analyses of 37 samples of sediment from three sites in the Manasquan River Basin reveal an elevated concentration of iridium of 520 pg/g, on average, at the base of the Pinna Layer. The iridium profile is aymmetric with an abrupt drop off above the base of this unit and a gradual decline below the base. The elevated concentration of iridium is not as high as that recorded from some other Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary sections. However, it is sufficiently above background level to suggest that it is related to the global Ir anomaly documented at many other localities, and attributed to a bolide impact. The position of the iridium anomaly at the base of the Pinna Layer is inconsistent with the biostratigraphic data, because this anomaly occurs below the unit containing fossils indicative of the uppermost Maastrichtian. We present two alternative hypotheses: (1) If the enriched concentration of iridium is in place, it marks the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary by reference to the global stratotype section and point at El Kef, Tunisia. The position of the iridium anomaly further implies that the Pinna community was living at the moment of impact and may even have flourished in its immediate wake. Subsequently, the community may have been buried by pulses of mud-rich sediment, possibly associated with enhanced riverine discharge following the impact. The Burrowed Unit may represent a subsequent pulse of riverine discharge that scoured the top of the Pinna Layer. (2) The iridium anomaly was originally located at the top of the Pinna Layer and was displaced downward due to bioturbation and/or chemical diffusion. This hypothesis implies that the Pinna Layer was deposited prior to the deposition of the iridium. The Pinna community may have died before or at the moment of impact. Erosion of the top of the Pinna Layer and deposition of the Burrowed Unit may have been associated with events immediately following the impact. In both hypotheses, the sea floor experienced an extended period of erosion and reworking in the early Danian, which may have lasted for several hundred thousand years, producing a concentrated lag of siderite nodules containing reworked fossils in the basal part of the Hornerstown Formation. This lag deposit is equivalent to the Main Fossiliferous Layer at the base of the Hornerstown Formation elsewhere in New Jersey. This period of erosion and reworking was probably associated with a transgression in the early Danian. The post-impact community was greatly reduced in diversity, with most of the species representing Cretaceous survivors.

T1  - The cynipoid genus Paramblynotus : revision, phylogeny, and historical biogeography (Hymenoptera, Liopteridae) 
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 304
SP  - 1
N2  - The genus Paramblynotus is the most species-rich genus of the so-called macrocynipoids, the large cynipoid parasitoids of wood-boring and cone-boring insect larvae. The species range in size from some of the largest to the smallest macrocynipoids, comparable in size to microcynipoids. Paramblynotus members occur on all continents except Europe and Australia, with most species being tropical or subtropical. The biology is poorly known but a few observations indicate that the species are parasitoids of beetle larvae. In this monographic revision of the genus, we present a species-level cladistic analysis based on qualitative and quantitative features of the external morphology. For analysis of quantitative features, we present for the first time a novel coding method, the method of Finite Mixture Coding (FMC) based on k-means clustering, or FMCK. The new method is similar to the FMC method proposed by previous authors in that they both generate codes (character states) for phylogenetic analysis as the direct output of a statistical procedure, thus avoiding the subdivision of quantitative data into discrete states on the basis of arbitrary criteria as with other coding methods. Through incorporating finite mixture analysis and likelihood estimation as used in FMC and k-mean cluster analysis for a priori statistical modeling of component distributions, FMCK is advantageous over FMC in that it can be implemented using readily available statistic programs with k-mean cluster analysis, such as STATISTICA, MINITAB or SYSTAT, available on both PC and Macintosh platforms. We were able to identify 8 quantitative characters among 23 as useful for cladistic analysis by using the new coding method. In total, our character matrix has 132 coded characters. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that species of the previously recognized genus Decellea form a monophyletic group deeply nested within Paramblynotus. Decellea is therefore synonymized with Paramblynotus, which is separated into seven monophyletic species groups: the virginianus, scaber, yangambicolus, nigricornis, apeosus, ruficollis, and punctulatus groups. Based on the phylogeny, we reconstruct the historical biogeography of the liopterid subfamily Mayrellinae, consisting of the genera Paramblynotus and Kiefferiella, using dispersal-vicariance analysis in combination with palaeoenvironmental data. The results suggest that the subfamily originated in the Northern Hemisphere and then expanded its distribution early by way of the Bering area. The divergence between Paramblynotus and Kiefferiella was apparently associated with the formation of the Rocky Mountains about 50 million years ago. An early Paramblynotus lineage dispersed to Africa from the eastern Palearctic by way of Arabia, and it subsequently diversified along with montane forests in Africa. The relatively high diversity of Paramblynotus in Southeast Asia is considered to be partly caused by the frequent sea level changes since late Oligocene (29 Ma), which drastically changed the land configuration of this area. We end this paper with a taxonomic revision of the genus Paramblynotus, with a total of 92 species treated, including 72 described as new and 20 previously known, of which 18 are redescribed. Keys to the species groups as defined in this paper and to all known species of each species group are provided. For all species, the available information on their biology and distribution are summarized.

N2  - A parsimony analysis was undertaken to test subfamily and tribal group concepts of Cassidinae (ca. 2000 genera, ca. 6000 species). An integrated account of their biology was synthesized from the primary literature. A detailed morphological study of adults, using Hemisphaerota palmarum Boheman as a model, formed the basis for evaluating characters previously utilized and for defining novel characters. The data matrix comprised 210 characters (from adults and immature stages, ecology and behavior), 6 outgroups, and 98 ingroup exemplar species (representing 94 genera and 39 of the 43 recognized cassidine tribes). Results support the monophyly of Cassidinae and place it as sister to Galerucinae. The classical Hispinae s.str. is paraphyletic whereas the classical Cassidinae s.str. is monophyletic if some Imatidiine genera are included. Four tribes--Aproidini, Delocraniini, Hemisphaerotini, and Notosacanthini--are well supported by many autapomorphies. Multiple genera were sampled to test the monophyly of 14 cassidine tribes. Seven were recovered as monophyletic: Anisoderini, Cassidini, Dorynotini, Eugenysini, Hispini, Omocerini, and Spilophorini. Relationships and character support of all cassidine tribes are discussed and compared with phylogenies proposed by Borowiec (1995) and Hsiao and Windsor (1999). The biological account and these phylogenetic results provide an opportunity for identifying some general trends and major innovations in the evolutionary history of Cassidinae. The alteration of the adult head from prognathy to hypognathy and the compaction of the body, legs, and various elytral-locking mechanisms are recurrent themes in adult morphology. Maternal care may have arisen once or twice. Seven trophic guilds are defined here for cassidine larvae. They arise from two large radiations of leaf-mining and exophagous-feeding, a minor radiation in cryptic rolled-leaf feeding, and small generic and sub-generic specializations in stem mining, leaf scraping, petalophagy, and leaf-shelter chewers. Fecal shield construction and retention appear to be correlated with innovations in life history and in larval and pupal morphology, and they may have played an important role in cassidine diversification.

N2  - Study of the materials in the American Museum of Natural History that pertain to the taxon Cormohipparion occidentale Skinner and MacFadden (1977) reveals that at least six species are represented. This is based on data from the cranium, upper dentition, lower dentition, and mandible. The taxa embrace a period of time from about 12.5 Ma to 10 Ma. Major sites or faunas include the Dove Spring Formation (medial Clarendonian, California; Burge Local Fauna (early Clarendonian, Nebraska); Minnechaduza Fauna, Nebraska; MacAdams Quarry, Texas (early medial Clarendonian); Gidley Horse Quarry (late medial Clarendonian, Texas); XMas-Kat, Hans Johnson, and Machaerodus quarries (late medial Clarendonian, Nebraska); and Ash Hollow Formation (late medial Clarendonian, South Dakota). The name Cormohipparion occidentale is restricted to the larger of two species that occur contemporaneously in medial Clarendonian sites in Nebraska and, alone, at the Ed Ross Ranch Quarry, South Dakota. The second species in the XMas-Kat and related quarries is assigned to Cormohipparion matthewi, n.sp. A taxon from the Burge Local Fauna is assigned to Cormohipparion merriami, n.sp. Another taxon from the Burge Local Fauna is assigned to Cormohipparion johnsoni, n.sp. Materials from the Texas sites are allocated as Cormohipparion fricki, n.sp., and Cormohipparion skinneri, n.sp., from the MacAdams Quarry and Gidley Horse Quarry, respectively. Cormohipparion fricki, n.sp., also is represented in the Minnechaduza Fauna, Nebraska. Cormohipparion is restricted geographically to North America. Based on this review, Cormohipparion johnsoni, n.sp., is the most plesiomorphic species of the C. occidentale group of taxa. Cormohipparion quinni is a plausible ancestor (sister-taxon) for the C. occidentale group, but also persisted with it until about 12 Ma. During their radiation, elements of the C. occidentale group demonstrate an increase in upper cheek tooth crown height and complexity of the enamel pattern, as well as an increase in overall cranial size, with each species showing its own mosaic of parameters. The interval of 12.5-10 m.y. witnessed the initiation of a period of climatic cooling and an eventual expansion of vegetation communities toward more open associations, in part showing an increase in grassy areas. Apparently, the C. occidentale group developed and maintained a mixed-feeding adaptation to these conditions, even though it had evolved very hypsodont cheek teeth by about 10 Ma (C. occidentale, s.s.; C. skinneri, n.sp.). Cormohipparion johnsoni, n.sp., and C. merriami, n.sp., are followed by C. fricki, n.sp., at about 12-11.5 Ma, which demonstrates an increased crown height and complexity of the upper cheek teeth along with the persistence of a functional dP1 into the adult condition. At least in C. fricki, n.sp., and likely also C. merriami, n.sp., the pre- and postfossettes of P2 commonly were confluent. All of these features are to be found in early Pannonian C members of Hippotherium of the Old World, and it is likely that a taxon such as C. fricki, n.sp., was associated with the Old World dispersal event that resulted in the presence of H. primigenium. A specimen of Cormohipparion sp. from deposits about 12 Ma old in California shows the proper morphology (enhanced by a significant increase in fossette complexity) to be a possible member of the dispersal population prior to its exit to the Old World at about 11 Ma. Subsequent North American species of the Cormohipparion occidentale group lived from about 11 Ma to 10 Ma and convergently approach (but do not equal) the enamel pattern complexity found in Hippotherium primigenium but surpass it in upper cheek tooth crown height, in the almost complete loss of dP1, and in a diminished frequency of confluence of the pre- and postfossetttes in P2. Two of these species, C. occidentale, s.s., and C. skinneri, n.sp., apparently populated a more northern (Great Plains) versus a southern (Texan) district, with C. occidentale, s.s., being sympatric with the (?secondarily) smaller C. matthewi, n.sp. The sample of C. occidentale, s.s., from the XMas-Kat quarries of Nebraska differs somewhat in a few cranial and dental parameters from samples from the Machaerodus and Hans Johnson quarries. Whereas the material from the XMas-Kat and Machaerodus quarries seems contemporaneous on geological grounds, the age of the sample from the Hans Johnson Quarry is not as securely dated. It is possible that the cranial differences (mainly the size of the preorbital fossa) and dental parameters (the persistence of a small and apparently functionally insignificant dP1 in adult female, but not male, crania) are variations in a contemporaneous but somewhat polymorphic population. Alternatively, it is possible that the Hans Johnson sample, at least, may be chronologically somewhat older than that from the Xmas-Kat quarries and that the morphological differences represent in part a more plesiomorphic condition for its specimens.

T1  - The braincase in Paleozoic symmoriiform and cladoselachian sharks

VL  - 307
SP  - 1
N2  - The concepts of platytrabia/platybasia and tropibasia/tropitrabia in gnathostomes are reviewed. The terms platytrabia and tropitrabia refer to developmental states of the embryonic trabecular cartilages that can be determined only by ontogenetic studies. The terms platybasia and tropibasia originally had this meaning, but have subsequently taken on additional descriptive connotations involving morphological features in the prechordal part of the adult chondrocranium. However, platybasia and tropibasia are not synonymous with platytrabia and tropitrabia. In gnathostomes, platytrabia usually gives rise to a platybasic adult condition (but not invariably; e.g., Lepisosteus), and tropitrabia usually gives rise to the tropibasic condition (modern elasmobranchs may be an exception). Thus, ontogeny does not provide an absolute guide to the adult condition, nor does adult morphology provide an accurate means to assess the prior ontogenetic condition in gnathostomes. Platybasia and tropibasia are regarded here as useful morphological terms that can be applied to fossils or to extant forms for which ontogenetic data are not available (although it may still be possible to reach some ontogenetic conclusions, based on morphological observations). A well-preserved but disarticulated fossil symmoriiform shark braincase from the Pennsylvanian of Arkansas is described under the informal generic designation 'Cobelodus', using digital reconstructions made from a high-resolution computerized-tomography (CT) scan. The braincase is morphologically tropibasic and clearly represents a departure from the common platybasic pattern found in elasmobranchs (e.g., Tamiobatis, Cladodoides, Orthacanthus). The contribution made by the embryonic polar cartilage in 'Cobelodus' was probably extensive (unlike in modern gnathostomes), as in the platybasic Paleozoic shark Cladodoides. Thus, tropibasia in 'Cobelodus' seems to be superimposed on an already-specialized pattern of cranial morphology found in some early platybasic elasmobranchs. The basicranial arterial circuit in 'Cobelodus' was highly modified, and its internal carotids could not have communicated with the cranial cavity via the bucco-hypophyseal chamber as in other elasmobranchs. Internal carotids either were absent or met the efferent pseudobranchials within the orbit before the combined vessel entered the cranial cavity via the orbital cartilage, but the arrangement was certainly not osteichthyan-like (where the combined internal carotid/efferent pseudobranchial arteries pass through the basisphenoid pillar). 'Cobelodus' and many other Paleozoic sharks possessed a postorbital palatoquadrate articulation (possibly strengthened by ligaments above the articulation in 'Cobelodus'), on cartilage presumably formed in the embryonic lateral commissure. This arrangement differs from that in amphistylic hexanchiform sharks, where the lateral commissure is absent and there is no postorbital arcade; the postorbital articulation is located instead on the primary postorbital process (an outgrowth of the supraorbital shelf). Hexanchiforms are the only extant elasmobranchs with a postorbital articulation, but do not occupy a basal position in modern morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses. Amphistyly in hexanchiforms is therefore viewed as a derived state rather than a highly conserved feature. No hyomandibular facet has been identified in 'Cobelodus', suggesting that its epihyal had only a ligamentous connection to the braincase. However, previous suggestions that symmoriiforms were aphetohyoidean (with a complete hyoidean gill slit and 'unmodified' hyoid arch) are not supported by morphological evidence. The systematic classification of symmoriiform sharks is in disarray. Symmoriiforms collectively are probably monophyletic, but within them only the family Falcatidae is characterized convincingly by synapomorphies. Remaining symmoriiforms have been traditionally classified as 'stethacanthids' and 'symmoriids', based respectively on the presence or absence of a spine-brush complex, but that distinction seems artificial because no undisputable 'brushless male symmoriids' or 'brushed female stethacanthids' have been documented and because sex-linked dimorphism of the spine-brush complex has been demonstrated only in falcatids. The braincase in Cladoselache shares some unusual features with 'Cobelodus', suggesting that Cladoselache and symmoriiforms are closely related, but it has yet to be determined whether Cladoselache was morphologically platybasic or tropibasic.

T1  - The summit herpetofauna of Auyantepui, Venezuela :  report from the Robert G. Goelet American Museum-Terramar Expedition

N2  - Auyantepui is an immense sandstone table mountain in the Venezuelan Guayana. This mesa did not appear on aviation maps and was unknown to the literate world prior to the late 1930s. It was explored from the air by Jimmy Angel, a bush pilot and colorful soldier of fortune for whom the world's highest waterfall is named (Angel Falls at the northern end of Auyantepui). About the same time, in 1937, Captain Felix Cardona Puig and Gustavo Heny discovered an access crack in the sandstone, allowing ascent onto the southern end of the mesa. The first scientific exploration followed immediately--the 1937-1938 Phelps Venezuelan Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History made the first zoological and general botanical collections. Today, no tepui other than the 'Lost World' of Cerro Roraima is better known to the general public. The summit of Auyantepui has a known fauna of 24 species of amphibians and reptiles, including species added by the Robert G. Goelet American Museum-TERRAMAR Expedition in 1994. This expedition collected 16 species during a month of fieldwork in the dry season (February), in five camps at elevations of 1700-2100 m above sea level. All species known from the summit of Auyantepui are treated in this bulletin; illustrations where possible include tadpoles, bioacoustic spectrograms, and hemipenes. Four new species are described--two frogs (Hypsiboas angelicus, n. sp., Eleutherodactylus auricarens, n. sp.), a lizard (Arthrosaura montigena, n. sp.), and a snake (Atractus guerreroi, n. sp.). Arthrosaura montigena possesses a hemipenial character not previously described--an orifice (orificium) of unknown function, situated in the lobular crotch between the two lobes. Attention is called to a probably undescribed snake (Liophis 'miliaris' sensu lato) from the nearby Gran Sabana. The herpetofauna of the Auyan summit comprises 12 families, 20 genera, and 24 species. This is compared with the known herpetofauna of the Chimanta massif, lying less than 50 km south-southeast of Auyantepui. Despite the proximity and similar dimensions, the summits of Auyantepui and Chimanta have in common only 11% of the combined number of species (4 of 36), 44% of the genera (11 of 25), and 62% of the families represented (8 of 13), showing that neighboring tepuis may have herpetofaunas very different from one another. Nonetheless, the adjacent mountains that constitute the more fragmented Chimant'a massif are relatively close to one another and seem to have a unified herpetofauna.

T1  - Phylogeny of the cichlid subfamily Etroplinae and taxonomic revision of the Malagasy cichlid genus Paretroplus (Teleostei, Cichlidae) 
JO  - Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History
SN  - 0003-0090
VL  - 314
SP  - 1
N2  - A species-level phylogeny for Etroplinae is presented, based on the simultaneous analysis of morphological and nucleotide characters, and species of the endemic Malagasy genus Paretroplus are taxonomically revised, including the description of two new species. Relative to most other cichlid genera, Paretroplus is diagnosed by numerous anatomical features, including morphology of the gas bladder, neurocranium, oral jaws and dentition, and suspensorium. Keys to the genera of Malagasy-South Asian cichlids and to the species of Paretroplus are provided. Paretroplus is endemic to Madagascar and is the sister genus to Etroplus, endemic to southern India and Sri Lanka. Together these two genera comprise the subfamily Etroplinae. Paretroplus comprises 12 species, two of which are described herein as new. Three morphologically distinct clades are recovered within Paretroplus, one comprising the comparatively elongate, primarily riverine and rheophilic species P. damii, P. nourissati, P. tsimoly, and P. lamenabe, new species, the second comprising the deep-bodied, primarily lacustrine species P. polyactis, P. petiti, P. kieneri, P. maculatus, P. menarambo, P. maromandia, and P. dambabe, and the third comprising the shallow-bodied and highly mottled species P. kieneri and P. gymnopreopercularis, new species, which occur in both lentic and lotic habitats. Monophyly of Etroplinae and Etroplus are also discussed and diagnostic anatomical features are presented for both clades. The sister-group relationship between Etroplus and Paretroplus represents a well-corroborated transoceanic link within Cichlidae, a pattern congruent with the Mesozoic fragmentation of Gondwana. The anterior of the gas bladder is highly modified in Etroplinae, reaching its most derived configuration in Paretroplus, in which multiple, structurally complex and rigid anterior bullae expand into large exoccipital recesses, forming a mechanical (5 otophysic) connection between the gas bladder and inner ear. Evolution of the gas bladder, and its function in conferring increased hearing ability, is discussed in terms of the phylogenetic information this structure provides for reconstructing hypotheses of relationships within Cichlidae.
